Please email me to schedule Zoom office appointments. Course Description This course introduces students to the fundamentals of public interest technology (PIT), including key concepts, theories and frameworks. Students will identify and analyze stakeholders, societal dimensions, and policy issues in the context of current and emerging technologies such as facial recognition technology, biotechnology, artificial intelligence and financial technology. Students will be introduced to the importance of socio-technical change, public values, anticipatory governance,1 of 8 **Disclaimer** This syllabus is to be used as a guideline only. The information provided is a summary of topics to be covered in the class. Information contained in this document such as assignments, grading scales, due dates, office hours, required books and materials may be from a previous semester and are subject to change. Please refer to your instructor for the most recent version of the syllabus. responsible innovation, and other key concepts when designing and developing technologies for the public interest. Students will also learn about methods meant to advance PIT principles and they will be exposed to critical issues such as governance, data ownership, consent, privacy, security, accessibility, and the digital divide. Throughout the course, students will engage PIT concepts, theories and frameworks through essays, case study presentations, a report on the consequences of a chosen technology, and a final exam. Course Objectives Course objectives include (1) understanding, (2) critically comparing and (3) applying theories, concepts, frameworks and methods for normatively assessing and governing technology Learning Outcomes At the end of the course, students will be able to: 1. Define, understand and apply fundamental principles and theoretical frameworks of public interest technology to real world cases. 2. Critically study, analyze and reflect on the successes and failures of existing and prospective sociotechnical systems, identifying key reasons for pain factors and how to overcome these problems by the creation of new and innovative products, processes or services; multi- directional feedback loops and multi-level alignments among end-users, providers, and developers; and anticipatory governance frameworks. Required Texts Where possible, we will rely on online readings, web links, and research articles accessible via the ASU Library and additional public web sites. Course Requirements 1. Discussions (30%): Students will participate in weekly discussions and related activities. In most cases these will consist of a 500 word clear and concise post to the discussion board, as well as a 100 word response to at least one classmate’s post. 2. PIT Theory and Concepts Essay (20%): Students will write a thoughtful and concise essay (10-12 pages, double-spaced) identifying, describing and critiquing one or more theories, concepts, or frameworks foundational to public interest technology. The essay should employ real-world examples to help illustrate the inherent conflicts, uncertainties and trade-offs that any understanding of the public interest will likely entail (including generating winners and losers, controversies over social values, and both technological and policy trade-offs). Finally, it should explain how well the theory, concepts or framework would help resolve, ameliorate or inform understanding of one or more of the identified challenges. 3. Written Assignments (10%). Students will write two short assignments that use theoretical and methodological frameworks to analyze the social dimensions of technologies. 4. Consequences of Technology Report (20%): Students will write a clear and concise short report (10-12 pages, double-spaced) that identifies a specific technology case, presents primary and secondary sources describing its claimed relevance to the public interest, and identifies2 of 8 governance issues, value conflicts, and potential unintended consequences associated with the technology’s development or use in a specific social context. The essay will include a description of the technology’s governance context (conditions, challenges, resources, institutions that may affect, e.g., strategies, research, product development, marketing and use). Finally, it will recommend and explain one or more PIT principles that should be used by specified actors to help guide the technology. 5. Final Exam (20%): Students will have a final exam (multiple choice, etc.) to demonstrate mastery of foundational PIT concepts.

Boston University,XCC433: Justice Media co-Lab ,https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/files/2021/04/CDS-COM-co-Lab-one-pager.pdf,Found," THE JUSTICE MEDIA CO-LAB Journalism is stronger when informed by and infused with data, which provide information about patterns that may be otherwise invisible. But many journalists lack access to “big data”—and the skillsets to interpret and use it compellingly. Enter Boston University’s Justice Media co-Lab, which supports the creation of excellent, data- driven journalism—and prepares BU students to leverage the power of computing and data sciences to advance justice and transparency in their future careers. A partnership between BU’s College of Communication (COM) and the new Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences (CDS), the Justice Media co-Lab engages faculty, students, and external experts in research and innovation collaborations and curricular and co-curricular programs with the potential for real-world impact. The theme of “justice” is interpreted broadly to allow for the exploration of a wide range of intersectional topics, from racial justice to environmental justice to issues of transparency and accountability—all with the public interest in mind. Building on proven success Since 2018, the program BU Spark! has partnered with other BU units, including COM, to engage students in computing and data science projects in support of external partners, including journalists. The students collect and analyze data to inform journalism, most of which focuses on issues related to social and criminal justice. BU Spark! operates under the auspices of the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences (CDS), BU’s newest degree-granting academic unit, focused on computational and data-driven discovery, innovation, and impact. To date, these student/professional collaborations have resulted in the publication of incisive, data-rich journalism including investigative pieces on the share of public contracts that go to Black-owned businesses (WGBH), police campaign contributions (The Boston Globe & The Baystate Banner), and federal prosecutorial misconduct (The Intercept). To date, more than 830 students in BU Spark! have completed more than 170 projects for external partners. Given the early success of the COM-CDS collaboration, and a continuing need for data-driven insights in investigative journalism, BU has formalized the partnership with the creation of the Justice Media co-Lab. How it works Building productive collaborations between disciplines as distinctive as computer science and journalism was a challenge in the past. CDS, however, is designed to cultivate such non-traditional partnerships, and to make data, computing, and data sciences far more accessible and useful for researchers and professionals in a broad range of fields. Through its Justice Media co-Lab, CDS provides: • Curriculum development support and faculty stipends to facilitate the creation of interdisciplinary research and courses • Project management of BU/external partner collaborations • Expert oversight of student work on complex technical projects involving, for example, machine learning and data engineering • Stipends for students working on projects in the Justice Media co-Lab In the near term, projects in the Justice Media co-Lab will include the creation of AI solutions for addressing bias in media; the support of investigative journalism projects using advanced data science collection and analysis methods; the development of software engineering tools to facilitate the collection, publication, and the use of publicly available open data sets on behalf of media partners among others. Donor support will not only sustain but also amplify all of the activities described above. Giving to the Justice Media co-Lab will help advance data-driven investigative journalism at BU, and help prepare future data journalists, whose fluency in computing and data science as well as journalism will help illuminate and ameliorate injustice.

Boston University,Law & Algorithms,https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/teaching/ds457/syllabus.pdf,Found," Page 1 of 8 Law and Algorithms – Spring 2022 Syllabus A joint class between the School of Law and the faculty of Computing and Data Sciences CDS 657 & 457 / JD 673 This cross-cutting and interdisciplinary course, taught jointly between the School of Law, the faculty of Computing and Data Sciences, and Computer Science investigates the role that algorithms and automated decision-making systems play in law and society. The course connects legal and computational concepts of transparency, fairness, bias, trust, and privacy, though a series of case studies that present recent applications of technology to legal and regulatory situations and explore the challenges in regulating algorithms. Legal concepts explored will include evidence and expert witnesses, anti-discrimination law concepts of disparate impact and disparate treatment, sectoral information privacy regimes, and public access and transparency laws. Computational concepts explored will include artificial intelligence and machine learning, secure multi-party computation, differential privacy, and zero-knowledge proofs. Grades will be based on a series of assignments that correspond with each case study, to be completed collaboratively in mixed teams of law and computing/data science students. 1. Instructor Information Gabriel Kaptchuk Research Assistant Professor of CS kaptchuk@bu.edu Ran Canetti Professor of Computer Science canetti@bu.edu Andy Sellars Clinical Associate Professor of Law sellars@bu.edu Consistent with our ongoing COVID protocols designed to minimize situations where disease transmission can be high, the instructors are not on campus as frequently as they would be in pre-pandemic years. That said, we still want to be as available to students as possible. Please use email or Microsoft Teams to schedule a time to meet. Note that meetings will likely be a mix of in-person or over Zoom. 2. Course Websites For course readings: https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/teaching/ds457/sp22-classpage.html For class discussions and announcements: see our Microsoft Teams page. We have opted to use Microsoft Teams as our main base of operation as it is available to all students at the university. CS & CDS students don’t have access to Law’s default platform (Blackboard) and Law students don’t have access to CS & CDS’ default platform (Piazza). You will be invited to join the Microsoft Teams channel through your @bu.edu email accounts. More information about BU’s use of Teams can be found here, and we recommend that you download the desktop version of the app to make your access easier. (You may, but are not expected, to download a smartphone version of the app at the same link.) Please refer to these resources for the most recent assignments and reading material. We will try to avoid alterations to class material with less than a week’s notice. If there ever are last-minute changes, we will let you know. Page 2 of 8 3. Course Information Meetings: Thursdays, 4:20—6:20pm, Jan. 20 to April 21 (except March 10) Location: BU Law Tower, Room 204 Credit Hours: For CDS 657: 4 Credits For JD 673: 3 Credits To account for the difference in credits, CDS/CS students will have one additional assignment, wherein they will develop a short guide that explains the computational aspects of a socio-technological system addressed in the course, written for non-CS audiences. More information on that assignment will be distributed separately. For the law students, per ABA guidelines you should anticipate a workload of roughly 42.5 hours per credit for the semester, which includes both in-class and out-of-class time. For elaboration, you may consult BU Law’s Credit Hour Policy. 4. Course Objectives The goal of this class is to help both law and computer/data sciences students to understand the importance of the other’s field to their home discipline, and how law and algorithms work in concert to regulate human behavior. We specifically expect that students will: ● Learn and appreciate the complicated relationship between law and algorithmic systems, and how the two act as interrelated regulators with different systems of adjudication and affordances for human input. ● Understand the fundamental systems of law as they relate to algorithmic regulation including basics of the common law system, as well as the rules and policies that inform the legal domains addressed in our case studies, including evidence, administrative law, legislation, criminal procedure, intellectual property, anti-discrimination law, election law, and information privacy. ● Understand the fundamental systems of computing and data sciences as they relate to law and policy questions, including computational thinking, probabilities, optimization, cryptography, artificial intelligence and machine learning, zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, differential privacy, and risk-limiting audits. ● Examine how both law and computer/data science reinforce and counter broader powers within social systems, including how both can perpetuate or mitigate bias and discrimination in criminal, civil, and administrative systems. ● Learn how to communicate concepts from their home discipline to those working in either law or computer/data science, and how to collaborate across disciplines to achieve mutual goals and policy outcomes. Page 3 of 8 5. Prerequisites There are no course prerequisites and no formal prior knowledge of law or computer science required to participate in this course. For law students, we ask that you come to the class with an open mind for computer science and mathematical thinking and vocabulary, and a willingness to explore the way in which algorithms practically operate in computational systems. For CS/CDS students: we think you will get the most out of this course if you have a good grasp of computer systems, algorithms and their analysis, AI basics, and computer security. We also ask that you come to the class with an open mind for understanding legal thinking and language, as well as the social aspects of information systems. While this is primarily a graduate level course, advanced undergraduate students in CS and CDS may enroll after receiving permission from the instructors. 6. Course Materials There are no required textbooks for this course, and all class material will be free. Readings will be made available through the course websites. The specific readings will be released over the course of the semester, so please refer to the website for the latest information. And because the material will change, do not read more than a week ahead without checking with us first. For the caselaw readings we’ll have this semester we are using the OpenCasebook platform, which allows you to both read our excerpt of the case and click through to see what we’re omitting. Unless otherwise indicated, students will be expected only to read/view the article, case excerpt, or blog post indicated, and not any other content on the site. There may also be optional readings associated with each class day. Optional readings are, indeed, optional. We’ve selected them because we think they may be interesting or engaging, but you are not required to read them. The quality of an interdisciplinary class like this really rises and falls on whether the students have done the reading, and we really appreciate the CDS students changing up their usual method of class preparation by doing a good degree of reading before each class. (We appreciate that from the law students too, of course, but it is more generally expected in legal education.) We ask that all students come to class having carefully read what is assigned and prepared to discuss the readings in class. 7. Classroom Attendance and Expectations The heart of this class is to provide a forum in which the disciplines of law and computer/data science can learn from each other. That learning is best fostered by active and engaged student participation. To that end, we ask that students attend each of the thirteen class sessions and actively participate in every class. (More on class participation below.) Page 4 of 8 That said, we are aware that unavoidable conflicts do come up, especially in these times. If one does arise, please contact one of the instructors in advance of the class so we can discuss it. We do not expect any student to miss more than two days of class, barring highly unusual circumstances. Boston University is now back to fully on-campus instruction, but public health concerns remain top of mind, especially with the Omicron variant continuing to spread. Please follow all university protocols for COVID testing and symptom attestation. Specifically: ● Do not attend class if you show even light COVID symptoms (fever, cough or other respiratory issues, nausea, etc.) or if you have any reason to believe that you are contagious with COVID or have been exposed. Please err on the side of absence here; we want to do all we can to protect each other. ● Follow all COVID protocols provided by Boston University and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Wear a mask at all times, and practice social distancing as much as is possible. As you surely know by now, the public health situation can change abruptly with COVID. Please be ready for changes to the classroom format and presentation, including a move to virtual classes if required by the University. 8. Assignments and Grading There is no exam for this course. Your performance in the above objectives will be evaluated through active participation in weekly classes, as well as in assignments that engage with our four case studies. Your grade is specifically based on the following: 8.1. Participation (25% of Grade) You will be expected to have read the assigned readings each week and participate actively in class discussion with substantive contributions. You satisfy this requirement by making at least one substantive contribution every week, in one of two ways: • during the class session, or • on the Microsoft Teams page in the section for the day’s class. If you choose to participate by making a substantive contribution before class on Microsoft teams, please be sure to post your comment far enough in advance that other students will have time to react to what you say. This is a good way to contribute if you are forced to miss a class or if you prefer written contributions to oral discussion. 8.2. Written Projects (75% of Grade, Split Evenly Across Five Assignments) Over the course of the semester, students will complete five short projects in mixed Law/CDS teams of three to four students (with each team including at least one Law and one CDS student). Because one of the goals of this course is to develop your skills at collaborating and communicating across disciplines, you should seek out as many different teammates as possible. You will not be allowed to complete more than one project with the exact same team.

Cal Poly State,The art of ethical design,,Found,"View Static Version Course Principles. Students should have the proper tools to navigate ethical design as they begin their careers.  .  Our mission for this quarter is to engage students to think ethically in their design. The design process is crucial to many projects and by including ethics, this allows students to learn how to design at a human and urban scale. By questioning the existing design tactics in our society, this engages students to rethink how designing for the people can greatly impact society and the well-being of others. Students are required to engage in discussions and provide insight based on experiences and/or readings. Students must be prepared to engage in discussions, meaning they must read/watch any given materials before the Zoom discussions. Questions for the course as you explore and discover:      How can ethical design strengthen/build communities?     How can we create designs that recognize the complexities of our society?     How can we challenge our society through inclusive and diverse design?     How can we take into consideration the environmental spaces that our designs are being built in?     What is the meaning of social infrastructure and how does it benefit our society?     To what extent should we follow through with a design even if we don’t agree with what the client is asking for?     Defining empathetic design and how it changes our view of the environment.     How can the construction of new buildings help to address environmental issues?     As designers to what extent do we need to choose ethics over aesthetics or can we have a duality?      Learning Goals  Students should have a comprehensive understanding of universal, inclusive, and sustainable design. With each unit, students should be able to connect each topic with each other and implement their understanding through their own designs and projects. These topics should allow students to recognize complex values, design tactics, and existing constraints that engage problem-solving in their designs. Learning Environment.  Each individual is responsible for contributing towards the class in discussions and insight. This class is a communal and social form of learning. Each person’s ideas should contribute towards a bigger discussion and each response should be respected. Positive contribution towards the class allows for an engaging and dynamic community where people feel safe to express their thoughts and ideas.  Disability: Under the Disabilites Act and Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973, individuals with disabilities are protected from any discrimation and must be assured the accommodations that would provide an equal learning experience and opportunities provided by the University. The individual must provide proof of their disabilities  If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and the Disability Resource Center, Building 124, Room 119, at (805) 756-1395, as early as possible in the term.  Academic Dishonesty: Cheating and Plagiarism: The University will not condone academic cheating or plagiarism in any form. Faculty are expected to uphold and support the highest academic standards in this matter. Instructors should be diligent in reducing potential opportunities for academic cheating and plagiarism to occur. Students' rights shall be ensured through attention to due process, as detailed on the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities' website. (CalPoly Website)  “Cheating is defined as obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain credit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by any dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not limited to: lying; copying from another's test or examination; discussion at any time of answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discussion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving copies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or displaying notes, ""cheat sheets,"" or other information devices inappropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other than the officially enrolled student to represent same.” (CalPoly Website)  “Plagiarism is defined as the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons as if they were one's own without giving proper credit to the source. Such an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were arrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought or idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original author or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e., quotation marks, footnotes, or commentary. Examples of plagiarism include, but are not limited to the following: the submission of a work, either in part or in whole completed by another; failure to give credit for ideas, statements, facts or conclusions which rightfully belong to another; failure to use quotation marks (or other means of setting apart, such as the use of indentation or a different font size) when quoting directly from another, whether it be a paragraph, a sentence, or even a part thereof; close and lengthy paraphrasing of another's writing without credit or originality; use of another's project or programs or part thereof without giving credit.” (CalPoly Website)  Attendance: Students may not miss more than the equivalent of 3 unexcused class-hours without receiving a lowered or failing grade. Given below, these are under the Universities of suggestable “excusable” reasons:      Injury, illness, death, or any extenuating circumstances¹ of close relatives (to include but not limited to natural, adopted, and/or in-law children, parents, legal guardians, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren as well as spouses or partners)     Active participation in university events (an instructor may require a statement from the adviser involved certifying that the student was actively participating in a recognized university event)     Field trips     Religious holidays     Selective service and military reasons     NCAA athletic competitions     Instructionally Related Activities (IRA)/competitions     Jury duty or any other legally required court appearances     Job or internship interviews  ",No difference between processed text 1 and 2,"View Static Version Course Principles.

Cal Poly State,Humanity for Sale: Ethics in Business and Technology,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e6488aeb4ace6093a40be2d/t/5fd69b0b7fc52c20692dc8ac/1607899917282/BUSINESS+syllabus.pdf,Found," Humanity for sale Ethics in Business and Technology Winter 2021 - Cal Poly, SLO Instructors: Ethan Beck Grace Chang Emma Schweers Course Description: The world of business is cutthroat. It’s a dog eat dog world out there and you have to use any advantage you can against the competition. In order to survive out there, you will have to use others as your stepping stones to victory. Or do you? As technology evolves, the opportunity for creating great good and great evil becomes more and more bountiful. With the rise of the internet, we now have more connections around the world than ever before. This allows large corporations to more easily exploit foreign policies, peoples, and the planet as a whole. When these choices are presented to us, we need to be armed with the correct knowledge in order to ensure that we choose the most ethical path. This path is walked through taking actions to protect not only ourselves but for other people as well. Our responsibility is to the people and the environment. In this course, we aim to arm you with the knowledge that allows you to do business morally, ethically, and successfully. Some may find these terms to be contradictory in the world of business, however, throughout this course we will explore how tackling a business with a goal of ethics leads to a more successful career. Considering how sensitive the economy is due to the current pandemic, owning a business is harder than ever. Ethics in business is important both morally, as well as financially. More often than not, the short term financial gain at the expense of ethics often results in unforeseen consequences later on. With Covid-19 spreading, many businesses have been pressured to close or take precautions that they otherwise wouldn’t have to take. As you emerge into the business world, these issues will become more and more prevalent. You will be forced to make difficult decisions so it is crucial for you to have a basis of ethical business practices. As a business owner, there will be choices you have to make that may seem to be financially beneficial but will sacrifice ethics. As we have seen in the past, sacrificing ethics is not only wrong, but it often becomes a detriment to the financial aspect of your business, commonly through lawsuits, poor reputation, etc. These decisions are becoming more prevalent, not only because we are in such an unstable time, but because we are also experiencing rapid advancements in technology as well. These advancements as stated earlier make the exploitation of people and the environment much easier and seemingly more profitable. Looking further down the road, it is becoming more common for artificial intelligence and automation to be seen in the commonplace, and the ethical implications of these advancements have yet to be fully discovered. As our technology evolves further and further, our understanding of ethics (especially in the business place), needs to evolve with it. We invite you to explore how these current global events, socio-political issues, and technological advancements affect you and the way you do business in the future. Course Goals: In this course, we will look at major writers from around the world whose words and voices helped readers to understand ethics, business practices, and individual responsibility. Writers like Plato, Aristotle, Wole Talabi, and Dave Eggers share fundamental views on philosophy and ethics which exposes students to various perspectives. The literature created by these writers resonates with the different issues arising in the business world. The course goals are for students to: ● Gather knowledge (or facts or theories) about each topic area from readings, instructor lecture material, and reading quizzes from the class. ● Demonstrate comprehension through research paper: critical thinking and problem-solving involve the ability to explain an ethical issue and construct a strong argument that articulates conclusions and their consequences. ● Understand the nature of the good and how through the application of the learned material, we can answer specific issues and challenges in business ethics. ● Analyze the impact of multiple factors on the interconnectedness of diverse peoples in the global environment.

In an age where technological advancement is happening at historically unparalleled speeds, it is more important than ever to closely examine the consequences of emerging tech. This course will examine some literary motifs about technology and technologists with particular attention to the results that our attitudes about technological development have on products and their impacts for users and society. These observations will be paired with real-life parallels in podcasts, articles, essays, and research papers to promote genuine reflection regarding the responsibilities of technologists and ethical issues surrounding technological applications in biomedicine, computer games, and machine learning. Why should I take this class? This course is exceedingly pertinent to developing technologists and those students who intend to go on to work in technological industries, but it also holds important considerations for those who will go on to work in agriculture, the public sector, and any developing field which intends to serve “the good” of humanity. By examining issues associated with the development of technology, you will learn to consider unforeseen costs of their actions and of technological development in the modern era. Why reading and writing? This quarter will primarily focus on writing and reading based learning. As engineers, you are expected to be proficient readers, writers, and critical thinkers. This class will give you the opportunity to expand upon your skills to critically analyze the assigned readings, listenings, and viewings. During our weekly “roundtable” discussions, we will be able to have honest and productive discussions regarding your ethical findings from each piece. This will prove to be a critical skill in the field given our rapidly evolving technologies and the increasing importance of critical analysis. In fact, critical reading, writing, discussion, and thinking skills are often valued more than your engineering abilities you learn in hands-on courses. Rest assured, you will leave this class with the tools to engage with ethical principles and discussions when developing new technologies. Why journaling? Given that your journals will account for 30% of your grade, it is imperative that you complete them every week. The journals are a space for you to reflect on your learnings and share thoughts or questions with your classmates. The online discussion board will give you an opportunity to delve deeper into the week’s content and converse with your peers. Discussion is critical in all disciplines - technical or not. Discussion trains us to think about the material we have learned and apply it in a way that creates a well crafted opinion. Throughout this course, you will find that productive discussions are at the heart of all good decisions. Objectives - Examine the impact of moral relativism and determinism on modern technology, and discuss the effects of these ideas on a developing technology (content moderation). - Learn how biases can be introduced in artificial intelligence and machine learning and how they affect the system’s accuracy and ability to make the correct decisions. - Understand the human rights and legal implications of creating artificial beings and manipulating genetics through eugenics. - Consider the risks involved with human testing of vaccines and with giving parents the right to choose for their child to be vaccinated. - Examine how computer games reflect a simulation of human reality. Discuss how the players’ actions in that world reflect aspects of their behavior in the real world. - Explore how ethical and moral problems are presented in computer games. Show how the problems need to be presented so that the player has clear options but doesn’t know the exact ramifications. Course Schedule Topic 1: An Introduction to Ethical Technology Week 1: Nathaniel Hawthorne -- “The Birthmark” Session 1) Reading comprehension quiz. Discuss parallels with the “Sermon on the Mount.” Discussion Questions: What role does technology play in driving perfectionism? Can technology be perfect? Can humans? Radiolab Podcast -- “Post No Evil” Session 2) Discuss personal experiences with social media content moderation, either first person or from an acquaintance’s experience. Consider over-moderation and under-moderation and how it affected the user. Discussion questions: Should speech be limited on certain platforms? Why or why not? To what extent can photos be considered speech? Week 2: Kurt Vonnegut -- Slaughter-House Five Session 1) Reading comprehension quiz. Compare and contrast the Tralfamadorians’ perspective with regular humans. Discussion questions: If the Tralfamadorians know what they are going to do ahead of time, can they stop themselves from performing immoral actions? Can they prevent other atrocities from occurring? Is it immoral for them to not even try?

As expected, this extreme reliance on technology has created its own set of mental health problems, as well as exacerbated prior existing conditions. This course will examine the far-reaching effects of technology on the human psyche, as well as the ethical implications of a technologically-dominated world on the decidedly human mind. We will dive deeper into the benefits of technology for psychological treatment as well as the shadow side of technology to mental health. This course will display the benefits and risks of how technology can affect mental health. As psychology and child development majors, we can look at the ethics of technology to see what will help and what will harm our clients. Office Hours: We will have scheduled and unrecorded Zoom meetings. I will hold hours from 12pm-1pm every Tuesday and Thursday. Please email me if you have conflicts attending these hours, and we can schedule a meeting time that works for you. This course provides an introduction to Ethical Technology and its practical application in psychology and child development. Learning Objectives and Criteria: Upon completion of the course students will: ● Understand how technology connects with various aspects in the field of psychology, such as research, treatment, and some interdisciplinary studies, and its positive and negative effects on mental health. ● Find a balance of technology to benefit the mental health of our clients. ● Identify key technological concepts that apply to the field of psychology and child development. Key Ethical Concepts: ● Find the ethical balance in social media to enhance relationships with the self and others. How much social media will poorly influence self esteem and mental health? And how much will social media bring people together? ● How can innovative technology heal emotional trauma without the risks of exclusion towards minority groups? Bias in the creation of biotechnology taints the product’s effectiveness towards people who tech companies failed to recognize. Lecture Periods: Will occur twice a week over Zoom, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2-4pm. Resources: We use a variety of resources including: ● The Technically Human Podcast: https://www.etcalpoly.org/the-technically-human-podcast ● Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ● The Social Dilemma ● Gattaca ● Several peer reviewed articles. Find PDFs with the readings in the “Assignments” tab on Canvas ● Several web-based articles. Find links with the readings in the “Assignments” tab on Canvas Course requirements: You must complete all course readings, as well as attend lectures, and complete all assignments and assessments.

For everyone around the world and for all age ranges, decision-making algorithms are ubiquitous. Whether we use this influence to improve or diminish peoples’ quality of living is up to us. What approach to decision making should we take when designing and implementing new technologies? What are the current ethical concerns in the industry and how are industry leaders addressing these issues, if at all? Each unit in this course will discuss the current ethical concerns in the industry and teach students the tools they need to navigate ethical conundrums. As students explore the large, spanning issues of today, they will confront problems and learn to consider a different side to everyday technologies. Rationale/Course Principles: Technology affects how we think, live, and interact with each other. It changes how we define what it means to be a person living in the 21st century. To the average consumer, technology is a black box so as the only people capable of recognizing its technical flaws, we must be the ones to identify and prevent those flaws. That being said, this course aims to achieve three major principles. First, to understand the current and future ethical implications of technology. Second, to build your toolkit in analyzing and critically assessing specific algorithms presented in real-world case studies. Lastly, to form your own unique ethical understanding of programming and design practices. Assignments/Breakdown: There are four major topics encountered in this course: Privacy, Addiction in Tech, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence. Each topic will consist of two weeks of material. Privacy is a baseline for understanding how people interact with technology and the human experience. The next topic of addiction leads to privacy concerns and enables the collection of big data. Big Data, in turn, drives Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is the course capstone because it encompasses the future of the computer science industry due to its game-changing capabilities. A group case study project accompanies each major topic. Your group will apply the principle teachings of that topic’s lecture material to a real example of ethical dilemmas in the technology industry. For each topic, the first week focuses on reading materials, while in the second week, groups prepare a case study for a final presentation at the end of the second week. With this case study, your group will also submit discussion questions to discuss in groups during class. For each topic, students will discuss questions they have for each sub-section and compile the group’s answer to each question, as well as comment with their own reflections for submission. Group case studies force students to seek out and discover more real-world examples of the major topics outside of class. Students can then find how these real-world examples impact them and further contemplate how their future careers affect the world. Furthermore, the discussions allow students to explain and verbalize their thoughts. In addition, they promote collaboration with classmates and foster an environment for critical thinking. Additionally, the first week introduces the course and the final week focuses on final remarks. During this first week of introduction, each student will write a 200-word journal entry on “what does ethical technology mean to you?” In the final week of the course, the student will repeat this journal entry to see how their views changed throughout the course. Lastly, for the final, each student will use all of their acquired knowledge of the course material to code an algorithm for a trolley problem. A written explanation discussing a student’s reasoning behind their decisions in context of the skills learned throughout the course will help determine their grade.

With such a broad subject, only a few specific topics will be discussed within this course on the ethics of technology in animal welfare. In this class, we will outline different points of ethical view on these topics, all while examining the technologies involved within. Non-live cover breeding is the process of artificially inseminating a specified female with sperm previously collected from a specified male in order to gain desired traits in offspring. With basic technology used, the ethics do not particularly come into play for technology, but instead Genetically modified organisms are produced using the obvious technology. Certainly, students are aware of the controversies surrounding GMOs in non-animal food 2 Animal Science 380: Ethical Technologies in Animal Science products, but through in-class discussions and labs they will gain the proper knowledge on animal-based food products involving GMOs, and the ethics behind the technology used to create these foods. Animals, although not in the same way as humans, still give way to showing intelligence and emotional capacity. Within this course, students will learn about the evolution and development of varying animals, along with the basics of care and husbandry. The last half of this class will contain in depth discussions about the ethics of producers and consumerism, the topic of humane slaughter, and the ideals of vegetarianism and veganism. While the general topic of ethical technologies in animal science holds enough information to be a year-long study, this course begins the conversation and presents the complexity of the subject. Students will leave this class with a finer understanding on how ethical technologies come into play within the animal science industry. Rationale: Throughout a career in the field of animal science, students will be presented with many ethical dilemmas. Technology provides us with previously inconceivable advances and abilities, but it also leads us into an uncharted territory of ethical challenges. The choices that are made in the fields of veterinary science, animal production, and breeding technology will have ethical implications and consequences with the potential to set precedents and impact the field for years to come. Therefore, it is imperative that students pursuing a career in animal science understand how to navigate the ethical dilemmas that they will inevitably face in the future. This course uses real, current and pressing issues in the field of animal science to demonstrate how to approach concerns arising from rapidly expanding and emerging technologies. Students will learn to evaluate and weigh the consequences of the choices made concerning the utilization of new technologies in animal science, and can apply this method of understanding and critical thinking in their future careers. Without students willing to take the initiative to prepare themselves with a thorough comprehension of the potentially problematic implications of new technologies, the field of animal science could quickly devolve into a minefield of ethical dilemmas. 3 Animal Science 380: Ethical Technologies in Animal Science Course Principles: Students are expected to attend class on time and be ready to contribute to in- class discussions. Participation is necessary and will contribute to your overall grade. To obtain a more thorough understanding of this course, it is necessary to be engaged in the discussions and actively participate in the course work. Only then will students be able to actively engage with the material, and their participation will force them to create concepts and bring up evidence found from course materials. In order to prepare students for future endeavors and professionalism, late work will only be accepted if notification is given well in advance. For each day after the due date, 5 percent of the assignment will be deducted from the 100 percent possible, turning a B- into a C+ and so forth. It is up to the students to keep track of their assignments and to check often announcements to see what is due for the week. Learning Goals: ● Be able to make a clear argument in favor of your stance on the topic of certain technologies in the field of animal science. ● Assess different course materials and make an educated review on a position. ● Effectively transmit important points from the course into the final debate. ● Determine the place of ethics in the field of animal production concerning the technologies used in animal slaughter, and how advances in the field may affect welfare concerns and farmers’ methods of production. ● Understand the evolution and development of GMOs within animal production and animal-based products and the consequences for consumers. ● Display comprehension of the procedures involved in selective breeding processes, such as artificial insemination, and determine the ethical implications of these technologies and practices. ● Students should be able to show understanding of animals’ emotional capacity and intellectual abilities, and how this information affects the ethics behind animal welfare and production.

Throughout our daily lives, we encounter these analytical methods when we use our smartphones, watch sports, or even vote in an election. These applications create automation in complex tasks efficiently, or have the ability to optimize problems that were once unsolvable. Although, this constantly evolving field is controversial in our current climate. Social and moral issues arise within data science through ill-intent or violations in data collection and storage. In essence, Data Science is a double-edged sword in affecting the technical and ethical outcomes of technology. To gain a deeper understanding of data science in the real world, we must consider the following questions: What are the correct methods to collect data? What are the benefits of using machine learning and artificial intelligence and how do they work? What must we be wary about when applying these algorithms? Lastly, what are its consequences and how can we prevent them? Course Objectives: In this course, we will investigate the technical and ethical sides of mathematics and statistics, and the role they play in the real world. Since this is an upper-level curriculum, our main goal is to gain knowledge and critical thinking on algorithms, statistical methods, proofs, and advanced techniques used in industry. We will also cover the importance of collecting and analyzing data honestly and justly. In addition, we will study the effects of mathematics, statistics, and data science in real world examples. To accomplish these goals, we will assign practice sets throughout the quarter and journal discussions on current events. The beginning of the quarter will cover basic definitions and mathematical proofs pertaining to theory. Then, we will dive into research and overarching benefits of data science. The middle of the quarter focuses on technical and ethical applications of data science and how we can evaluate their results. It is also important to consider entry into the data science field because it continues to be a significant field in our advancing world. Therefore, we will cover access to technology near the end of the quarter. The final project presentation pertaining to your specific major will allow you to work in an industry-like work environment and progress your career interests. Overall, this course is intended to set you up in the right direction for your career in STEM. Summary of Learning Objectives: ● Ability to apply correct statistical and mathematical methods in the data science field ● Understand mathematical theory behind algorithms and utilize proofs to gain a deeper reasoning to specific methods ● Learn how to honestly and justly collect and analyze data and understand how this affects society in the real world. ● Become aware of ethical concerns in AI/ML implementation to prevent consequences or to efficiently remediate them. ● Strengthen student involvement with current events by analyzing recent articles and groundbreaking discoveries in tech. ● Allow students to be wary and lenient with the access to technology in education to enforce inclusivity. ● Work on team-based projects in an industry-level setting to prepare for future careers and to practice public-speaking skills.

Throughout our daily lives, we encounter these analytical methods when we use our smartphones, watch sports, or even vote in an election. These applications create automation in complex tasks efficiently, or have the ability to optimize problems that were once unsolvable. Although, this constantly evolving field is controversial in our current climate. Social and moral issues arise within data science through ill-intent or violations in data collection and storage. In essence, Data Science is a double-edged sword in affecting the technical and ethical outcomes of technology. To gain a deeper understanding of data science in the real world, we must consider the following questions: What are the correct methods to collect data? What are the benefits of using machine learning and artificial intelligence and how do they work? What must we be wary about when applying these algorithms? Lastly, what are its consequences and how can we prevent them? Course Objectives: In this course, we will investigate the technical and ethical sides of mathematics and statistics, and the role they play in the real world. Since this is an upper-level curriculum, our main goal is to gain knowledge and critical thinking on algorithms, statistical methods, proofs, and advanced techniques used in industry. We will also cover the importance of collecting and analyzing data honestly and justly. In addition, we will study the effects of mathematics, statistics, and data science in real world examples. To accomplish these goals, we will assign practice sets throughout the quarter and journal discussions on current events. The beginning of the quarter will cover basic definitions and mathematical proofs pertaining to theory. Then, we will dive into research and overarching benefits of data science. The middle of the quarter focuses on technical and ethical applications of data science and how we can evaluate their results. It is also important to consider entry into the data science field because it continues to be a significant field in our advancing world. Therefore, we will cover access to technology near the end of the quarter. The final project presentation pertaining to your specific major will allow you to work in an industry-like work environment and progress your career interests. Overall, this course is intended to set you up in the right direction for your career in STEM. Summary of Learning Objectives: Ability to apply correct statistical and mathematical methods in the data science field Understand mathematical theory behind algorithms and utilize proofs to gain a deeper reasoning to specific methods Learn how to honestly and justly collect and analyze data and understand how this affects society in the real world. Become aware of ethical concerns in AI/ML implementation to prevent consequences or to efficiently remediate them.

Course website https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/ About this course The Policy Innovation Lab is a new Public Interest Technology initiative that connects students with real policy challenges and introduces an agile, design-driven framework to rapidly create solutions to those challenges. This course is an experiment in improving public policy by working outside the traditional structures of government. For Fall 2021, the Policy Innovation Lab will be looking at ways to improve Public Interest Tech workforce development and recruitment, with a special lens towards diversity, equity and inclusion. Students will be working with external partners to investigate real problem spaces and building policy- driven prototypes driven by user research. Students will work to solve pressing challenges by redefining the problem in terms of understanding the affected users of systems, conducting user-centered research, designing solutions, testing those same solutions, and iteratively improving those outcomes. This course is designed to take advantage of recent lessons learned in applied innovation in government entities around the world. The actual outcomes will be heavily dependent on both the needs of the problem sets for each course as well as the skills of the students. The course will apply some methodologies commonplace in industry like agile, design-thinking, and prototyping to deliver open source products and services that have the potential to live on beyond the course. For public-facing projects, work will be done in a transparent manner where possible in order to encourage external participation. Students will be expected to embrace a culture that expects and encourages rapid iteration, express a willingness to fail early in order to discover a solution that ultimately works, and a flat structure that provides students with an opportunity to deliver for our government partners. Prerequisites This course is designed for graduate-level experience that have at a minimum basic computer proficiency skills. This means you should feel comfortable working with data in spreadsheets, an ability to write clearly and organize materials well, an interest in exploring new programs and present a willingness to learn something outside of your comfort zone. Learning outcomes 1. Apply agile methodologies and iterative design strategies to understand how to support innovation in a government agency. 2. Use agile and lean methods to make cross-disciplinary teams and government partner interactions functional and valuable. 3. Conduct conduct user research to design better experiences for citizens. 4. Build prototypes quickly, test them, and repeat the process with stakeholder involvement. 5. Develop and document a final Minimum Viable Product and deliver clean handoff to the partner.

Course Description This course aims to further develop empathy skills that were learned in ESC 205: Disability, Empathy and Technology I and also to develop the ability to switch between empathic and analytic orientations. Students will participate in four elements:  student presentations on professional roles in working with people with disabilities  classroom training in mode switching between empathic and analytic orientations  interprofessional interactions with other students  regular visits to the home of a specific person with a disability General Information Meeting time and place: Wednesday 6:00-7:50 in WH 205 Instructor: Dr. Eric Schearer, e.schearer@csuohio.edu, 630-209-0214, FH 104 Office Hours: M 1:00-3:00 in FH 104 (text me to get in) Prerequisites ESC 205: Disability, Empathy & Technology I Course Objectives 1) develop an understanding of the roles of different professions who work with people with disabilities 2) develop the ability to switch between an empathic orientation and an analytic orientation 3) propose a project to address a specific challenge facing a person with a disability Textbook There is no textbook. You will read selected articles compiled by instructor and posted on Blackboard. Grading Weekly reflection papers (writing) 50% Each week students will write a 2-page paper reflecting on her/his experiences in the previous class. The reflection paper will answer specific questions that are unique to each class session and be graded by the instructor based on a rubric rating the level of detail, synthesis of ideas from the class instruction with the student’s personal experience, and clarity of writing. Project proposal presentation (oral communication) 25% Groups of students will give a 20-minute presentation proposing a technology project aimed at addressing a challenge faced by a person with a disability. Students may choose to do these projects as part of a later senior capstone course or research experience. The presentations will be graded by the instructor based on a rubric rating the students’ delivery, purposeful structure, appropriateness of content, and creativity. Performance in simulation exercises and home visits (oral communication) 25% Students will be graded in each of the simulation exercises in Weeks 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 and in home visits in weeks 5, 9, 12, and 14. The instructor will grade students’ performance on each simulation exercise according to a unique rubric for each exercise. A professional (medical, therapy, social work, engineering) will supervise students on each home visit and grade students in their profession based on a rubric for that visit. Professional graders will include the course instructor (engineering), a member of the Cleveland Home Health team (medical), a CSU social work collaborator, and a CSU physical or occupational therapy collaborator. Grade Score A [92%-100%] A- [90%-92%) B+ [88%-90%) B [82%-88%) B- [80%-82%) C+ [78%-80%) C [70%-78%) D [60%-70%) F < 60% Attendance Policy Students who miss a class should work with other students in the course and their group to make up any missed work. Documentation for medical / other excuses should be submitted via email to the instructor as soon as possible, but no later than a week after the missed classes. In this active-learning and team based class format, attendance at all classes is crucial and your final grade will be significantly impacted if you miss class. Students are responsible for providing the instructor with appropriate documentation of the reasons for any class absences. Students with excessive absences may fbe withdrawn from the course. Absences are considered excessive after 5 absences (this total can be a combination of either excused or un-excused absences). Blackboard All homework assignments, grades, and official course announcements will be posted to Blackboard. I will try to remind you of upcoming events in class, but please check Blackboard at least on a weekly basis. Assignments will be turned in via Blackboard. Academic Integrity Integrity is very important. Do your own work and give credit to people who helped you. You are encouraged to discuss ideas for reflection assignments with your classmates, but your submissions must be your own work. If you submit a homework assignment with or include in your final presentation direct quotes from a classmate’s work or from some other source without citing the source you will receive a grade of zero for that assignment, and I will write a letter of reprimand to be placed in your student record. If this occurs more than once on your homework assignments you will receive a grade of F for the course, and I will write a letter of reprimand to be placed in your student record. Students with Disabilities I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that you may require as a student with a disability. I encourage you to make requests for academic accommodations during the first week of class. Please work with the Office of Disability Services for determination of reasonable academic accommodations. For more information visit http://www.csuohio.edu/disability/for-students. Professional communication What to do before sending an email  Ensure you have exhausted every other possibility to solve your problem (consult class notes/documents/library, ask class mates, search the internet or use the help function of software).  Ensure you do not send an email you wish you could take back the next day: ◦ Keep emails factual. ◦ If you are in an emotional state wait a night before sending your email. When you decide to send an email  Ensure your email is written in a professional manner. This includes but is not limited to the following: ◦ Correct grammar and spelling. ◦ Complete sentences with correct punctuation and capital letters. ◦ No use of short hand, colloquial language or graphical elements such as emoticons etc. Decide on one clear point or question you want to raise. If an answer would require more than one or two short paragraphs to answer, it is a topic to be better discussed in person. What to include in your email  Meaningful subject line that clearly states the course code and the one issue/question it contains.  Describe your issue/question clearly and in a succinct way (bulleted or numbered lists can be helpful).  Clearly describe the steps you have taken to resolve the issue/answer the question (see other avenues above).  Don't provide extensive and irrelevant details on why you could not resolve your question/hand in the assignment/come to class! Include only a factual, succinct description and appropriate evidence.  Describe precisely in which way you think the instructor can help you.  Address the recipients by their name, including the appropriate salutation.  Sign the email with your full name. After you send an email  Expect it to take at least one business day for a response in urgent cases.  If you have not considered all of the above points, for your professional development I will ask you to rewrite your email to adhere to the guidelines. If you need to talk to me  A good time to discuss questions that are of interest to everybody is in class. We will provide time for you to ask questions.  If the issue needs to be discussed in person, please come to office hours or send me an email to request an appointment. In these cases, all of the above rules for writing emails will apply. Student safety in home visits Students will visit the homes of people with disabilities in partnership with Cleveland HomeHealth, a part of the CSU/NEOMED Partnership in Urban Health. Cleveland HomeHealth will screen the neighborhoods and homes before students visit, conduct an orientation for students before their first visit, and a CSU/NEOMED Partnership in Urban Health faculty member will oversee pre-visit meetings, home visits, and post-visit reviews. A CSU police officer will be on call in the area near each home visit.

Students will participate in four elements: • student presentations on professional roles in working with people with disabilities • classroom training in mode switching between empathic and analytic orientations • interprofessional interactions with other students • regular visits to the home of a specific person with a disability General Information Meeting time and place: Wednesday 6:00-7:50 in WH 205 Office Hours: M 1:00-3:00 in FH 104 (text me to get in) Prerequisites ESC 205: Disability, Empathy & Technology I Course Objectives 1) develop an understanding of the roles of different professions who work with people with disabilities 2) develop the ability to switch between an empathic orientation and an analytic orientation 3) propose a project to address a specific challenge facing a person with a disability Textbook There is no textbook. You will read selected articles compiled by instructor and posted on Blackboard. Grading Weekly reflection papers (writing) 50% Each week students will write a 2-page paper reflecting on her/his experiences in the previous class. The reflection paper will answer specific questions that are unique to each class session and be graded by the instructor based on a rubric rating the level of detail, synthesis of ideas from the class instruction with the student’s personal experience, and clarity of writing. Project proposal presentation (oral communication) 25% Groups of students will give a 20-minute presentation proposing a technology project aimed at addressing a challenge faced by a person with a disability. Students may choose to do these projects as part of a later senior capstone course or research experience. The presentations will be graded by the instructor based on a rubric rating the students’ delivery, purposeful structure, appropriateness of content, and creativity. Performance in simulation exercises and home visits (oral communication) 25% Students will be graded in each of the simulation exercises in Weeks 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 and in home visits in weeks 5, 9, 12, and 14. The instructor will grade students’ performance on each simulation exercise according to a unique rubric for each exercise. A professional (medical, therapy, social work, engineering) will supervise students on each home visit and grade students in their profession based on a rubric for that visit. Professional graders will include the course instructor (engineering), a member of the Cleveland Home Health team (medical), a CSU social work collaborator, and a CSU physical or occupational therapy collaborator. Grade Score A [92%-100%] A- [90%-92%) B+ [88%-90%) B [82%-88%) B- [80%-82%) C+ [78%-80%) C [70%-78%) D [60%-70%) F < 60% Attendance Policy Students who miss a class should work with other students in the course and their group to make up any missed work. Documentation for medical / other excuses should be submitted via email to the instructor as soon as possible, but no later than a week after the missed classes. In this active-learning and team based class format, attendance at all classes is crucial and your final grade will be significantly impacted if you miss class. Students are responsible for providing the instructor with appropriate documentation of the reasons for any class absences. Students with excessive absences may fbe withdrawn from the course. Absences are considered excessive after 5 absences (this total can be a combination of either excused or un-excused absences). Blackboard All homework assignments, grades, and official course announcements will be posted to Blackboard. I will try to remind you of upcoming events in class, but please check Blackboard at least on a weekly basis. Assignments will be turned in via Blackboard. Academic Integrity Integrity is very important. Do your own work and give credit to people who helped you. You are encouraged to discuss ideas for reflection assignments with your classmates, but your submissions must be your own work. If you submit a homework assignment with or include in your final presentation direct quotes from a classmate’s work or from some other source without citing the source you will receive a grade of zero for that assignment, and I will write a letter of reprimand to be placed in your student record. If this occurs more than once on your homework assignments you will receive a grade of F for the course, and I will write a letter of reprimand to be placed in your student record. Students with Disabilities I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that you may require as a student with a disability. I encourage you to make requests for academic accommodations during the first week of class. Please work with the Office of Disability Services for determination of reasonable academic accommodations.

Final Presentations Final Lessons Learned Presentation H4D Semester Syllabus Page 3 of 46 Grading Criteria This course is team based and 100% of your grade will come from your team progress and final project. Plus and Minus overall course grades will be assigned. Your peers will also grade your contribution to your team. Grading criteria are broken down as follows: 15% Individual participation in class. You will be giving feedback to your peers. 30% Out-of-the-building progress as measured by blog write-ups and presentations each week. Each week, team members must complete the required number of interviews and update the Mission Model Canvas. 25% Team weekly “lesson learned” update presentation (see weekly schedule for required content and format) 30% Team final presentation (see Weeks 13 and 14 for format) This total score is multiplied by a “peer grading multiplier” as assigned to you by your team at the end of the semester. Any act of academic dishonesty or unprofessional behavior will result in a failing grade on that assignment and possibly in the course. Any student who does not contribute significantly to the project, the group’s final document and presentation, and/or consistently misses or is late to scheduled team meetings may fail the course. Note also that students who choose not to meaningfully contribute to their project or are not doing so in a timely manner (on schedule) may be removed from the team during the course and will not receive a passing grade. Any such removals will only occur after discussion with the team and after consultation with the Instructor, who may first prescribe certain probationary measures. If the non- participatory situation continues, the student may be removed from the team at the discretion of the Instructor, and tasks within the team may then be reassigned (or the project scope adjusted) to compensate for the loss of the team member. Submissions / Late submissions / Make-up Policies: • Projects and assignments must be uploaded to Webcourses or turned in at the beginning of the class period (whichever is specified for the particular project or assignment) on the specified due date at the specified time – no other submissions will be accepted. • Late Work: No Credit • No make-up assignments nor make-up quizzes will be given: missed quizzes will receive a grade of zero: any exceptions must be approved by the instructor in advance of the quiz.

Georgetown,Advanced Programming,https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~huiyang/cosc-150/Syllabus2017Fall.pdf,Found,,,"COSC 150 – ADVANCED PROGRAMMING COURSE SYLLABUS Textbooks : No required text. However we recommend the following textbooks: Thinking in Java (4th Edition) 4th Edition by Bruce Eckel Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer (Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby) by Sandi Metz This class will also have a significant online presence. Students are required to participate in online discussions on Piazza ( https://piazza.com/georgetown/fall2017/cosc150/home ). COURSE DESCRIPTION The objective of the course is to develop a mastery of object-oriented programming using the Java programming language and to expose students to advanced programming and basic software engineering concepts important for upper-division courses. Topics include object-oriented design and programming, unit testing, UML, event-driven programming, exception handling, sockets, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and advanced programming projects such as artificial intelligence and/or mobile computing. Prerequisite: COSC-052. COURSE OBJECTIVES Students passing this course will be able to ... 1. to develop software solutions with some degree of independence and maturity, and to make use of current software libraries and packages for advanced program development, 2. to program with proper use of object oriented concepts, 3. to create event-oriented GUIs with sensible human-computer interaction, and including 2D graphics 4. to use effective techniques for building and debugging robust programs, including a debugger, unit testing, and exception handling, 5. to use basic software engineering principles and design paradigms, 6. to learn collaborate in teams to finish a large project. POLICIES ● Please turn off cell phones during class. ● We will do our best to respond to emails within 24 hours. Please also consider posting your questions to Piazza (https://piazza.com/georgetown/fall2017/cosc150/home). ● Behave civilly: don't be late for class; don't read newspapers/blogs/etc. during class; don't solve Sudoku puzzles during class; don't struggle with crossword puzzles during class; respect others' opinions, even if they are clearly wrong. ● Adhere to good scientific principles and practices, and uphold the Georgetown Honor System. Academic Integrity Academic integrity is central to the learning and teaching process. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that will contribute to the maintenance of academic integrity by making all reasonable efforts to prevent the occurrence of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty includes (but is not limited to) obtaining or giving aid on an examination, having unauthorized prior knowledge of an examination, doing work for another student, and plagiarism of all types, including looking at or copying another student’s code. Plagiarism is the intentional or unintentional presentation of another person's idea or product as one's own. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to the following: copying verbatim all or part of another's written work; using phrases, charts, figures, illustrations, code, or mathematical / scientific solutions without citing the source; paraphrasing ideas, conclusions, or research without citing the source; and using all or part of a literary plot, poem, film, musical score, or other artistic product without attributing the work to its creator. Students can avoid unintentional plagiarism by following carefully accepted scholarly practices. Notes taken for papers and research projects should accurately record sources of material to be cited, quoted, paraphrased, or summarized, and papers should acknowledge these sources in footnotes. In short, do not cheat. Dealing with cheating is by far the worst part of a professor's responsibilities, and it's one that we would greatly like to avoid. If you are caught cheating, you will be referred to the Honor Council, without exception. It doesn't matter if you plagiarized one part of one answer in a homework assignment or outsourced your entire semester project to www.willdoyourprojectforcupcakes.com. Telling us that we’re ruining your future/career/life will make us feel wicked bad, but won't stop us from referring you to the Honor Council. Ignorance of Georgetown's Standards of Conduct is not an acceptable excuse for academic dishonesty. You are expected to be familiar with and abide by these standards.","COSC 150 – ADVANCED PROGRAMMING COURSE SYLLABUS Textbooks : No required text.

Georgetown,Introduction to Algorithms,https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~cnewport/teaching/cosc240-spring20/,Found,"  COSC 240 - Introduction to Algorithms (Spring 2020) Georgetown University Prof. Calvin Newport Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30 - 1:45 Healy Hall, Room 103  NEW: Information on Shift to Online Instruction Lectures  The current plan for online instruction is to hold our lectures during their normally scheduled times using Zoom video conferencing software. I will use the shared whiteboard feature in conjunction with a writing tablet to simulate the blackboard. I'll also make available video recordings of all lectures.  We will use the same recurring meeting for all lectures. The link was sent to you via email. Let me know if you need it. Midterm/Final  Based on the recommendation of the Dean's office to delay formal assessments until after the move out period, the midterm has been shifted to April 2nd. It still, however, only covers Parts 1 and 2. The midterm will be take home but timed, taking place during the normal lecture period. I will be available via Zoom for questions. Additional time periods can be arranged for students who need accomodations due to issues such as time zone conflicts. More details will be shared as we get closer to the exam date.  I will wait until after our midterm to decide on the details for how I will administer the final exam (I want to learn from the midterm experience.) Problem Sets  The only change to the problem set process is that you'll now submit them electronically by 12:30 on their due date using a Canvas site for this course. (Instrutions for this electronic submission procedure are pending.) Office Hours  Professor and TA office hours will nowplace using Zoom during their nnormally scheduled times. The relevant links are below:      Professor office hours [Zoom Conference Link]     Shuyang office hours [Zoom Conference Link]     Haotian office hours [Zoom Conference Link]  Communication  Outside of the Zoom lectures and office hours, I'll continue to send any relevant updates or notes to the class email list. I will also monitor my email carefully, including during scheduled zoom conferences (in case of technical difficulties). Course Overview  Description  This course explores various techniques used in the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Topics covered include sorting, search trees, hashing, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, graph algorithms and basic complexity theory.  Supported by funding from the Mozilla Foundation, and working in conjunction with Georgetown's Ethics Lab, we will also be experimenting this semester with integrating into the curriculum content on ethics and social responsibility in computer science. Your participation and feedback regarding these modules will be much appreciated, as it will help shape the evolution of this innovative endeavor.  Textbook  The required textbook for this course is Introduction to Algorithms (Third Edition) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein. Most of the topics and examples covered in this course will be adapted from this text.  Grading  This course focuses on the theoretical aspects of designing and analyzing correct and efficient algorithms. Accordingly, there are no programming projects. Problem set assignments and exams will instead require pencil and paper analysis.  In more detail, grades in this course will be based on problem sets, a midterm, and a non-cumulative final.  The problem set problems will be graded on the following scale: check plus (correct answer with at most minor issues), check (shows understanding but has at least one major issue), and zero (does not demonstrate a reasonable understanding of the problem, or we could not follow your solution). Each check plus earns you 4 points, each check 2 points, and each zero, of course, 0 points. At the end of the semester, I add up all the points you earned, and this number is your problem set score.  Each problem set will be returned to you along with sample solutions, grading notes, and a guide to mapping your point score to a letter grade scale. Though this mapping will vary from problem set to problem set, depending on length and difficulty, in most cases, to earn an A on a problem set you should be aiming to get a check plus on most problems.  The midterm will be taken in class and will cover material from the first half of the class. The final exam will be taken during the final exam period and will cover material from the second half of the class. That is, the final exam is not cumulative. The midterm will be returned to you with sample solutions, grading notes, and a guide to mapping your numerical score to a letter grade.  In determining your final grade, I will add up the total points you earned on problem sets, the total points you earned on your midterm, and the total points you earned on your final. I will then map your point sum to a final letter grade.  To do so, I add to our class grading spreadsheet invented A, B, C, and D students. For each assignment and exam I give the A student the score that corresponds to the middle of the A range, the B student the score that corresponds to the middle of the B range, and so on. At the end of the class, I sum up the scores in these rows to establish a basic point range for A, B, C, and D grades. I use these to help inform the final mapping of your numerical score to a letter grade.  Notice, the total points available for the problem sets will add up to be roughly 50% of the total possible points, with the total points available on the midterms and final each adding up to roughly 25% of the available points.  If you have any questions about your current course performance please do not hesitate to talk to me. I do not want your final grade to be a surprise. Course Logistics and Policies Professor Office Hours  I hold regular office hours from 2:00 to 3:00 on Tuesday and Thursdays in my office at 356 Saint Mary's Hall. I'm also available for quick questions before and after class and via email at cn248@georgetown.edu. If you need a longer meeting and cannot make my regular office hours times, we can always find another meeting time that works. Teaching Assistants  This course has two graduate student teaching assistants who will hold their own regular office hours in the student lounge (STM 328) near the bathrooms on the third floor of Saint Mary's Hall. They can also answer questions via email. Their contact information and office hours times are as follows:      Shuyang Yu (sy614@georgetown.edu)         Office Hours: Monday, 5:00 - 7:00pm.     Haotian Xue (hx82@georgetown.edu)         Office Hours: Wednesday, 10:00am - 12:00pm.  Problem Sets  The course schedule below describes when each problem set is assigned, when it is due, and what lectures it covers. I will post a link for downloading each problem set on the course schedule on the day the problem set is assigned. Keep in mind that the problem set schedule on the course schedule is preliminary and might shift as the semester progresses.  The following rules describe my expectations and grading policies for problem sets:      You can work alone or with other people from the class on the problems. However: every student must hand in their own problem set solution written in their own words.     You are probably better off working alone, as this optimizes how well you learn the material, but I will not require this as it is too hard to enforce.     You may only discuss problems with me, other students in the class, or the course teaching assistants. The only materials you can reference when working on these problems are your course notes, the course notes of other students in the class, and the assigned textbook. In particular, you may not reference online sources or solutions from previous/other classes.     Problem sets should be handed in at the beginning of class on the day they are due. That is, bring a physical copy of the problem set to class to give to me before the lecture begins. If you cannot make class, please make arrangements with me in advance for alternative submission procedures.     Problem sets not handed in by the beginning of lecture will be considered late, and 4 points will be deducted. Problem sets not handed until the day after the deadline will have 8 points deducted (slide late problem sets under my door if I am not in my office). Beyond this point, problem sets will not be accepted unless we've agreed in advance on an accommodation.  Exams  There will be two exams in the course: a midterm and a final. The final exam is not cumulative; that is, it covers material from the second half of the course. Academic Integrity  I take academic integrity seriously. To repeat the problem set instructions from above: You can work in groups of at most three people on the problem sets. All students must write up their own answers and record on the top of the problem set any group members they worked with.  You many only discuss problems with me, your group members, and teaching assistant. The only materials you can reference when working on these problems are course notes from the current semester and the assigned textbook. In particular, you may not reference online sources or solutions from previous semesters.  You may not bring any outside material into exams.  Violating these rules will lead to a zero on the assignment and potential reporting to the academic honor council.  When in doubt, ask me what is allowed. Schedule  Below is the current schedule for the course. I might adjust this schedule as the semester progresses so please keep checking back for the latest version.

Problem Sets The course schedule below describes when each problem set is assigned, when it is due, and what lectures it covers. I will post a link for downloading each problem set on the course schedule on the day the problem set is assigned. Keep in mind that the problem set schedule on the course schedule is preliminary and might shift as the semester progresses. The following rules describe my expectations and grading policies for problem sets: You can work alone or with other people from the class on the problems. However: every student must hand in their own problem set solution written in their own words. You are probably better off working alone, as this optimizes how well you learn the material, but I will not require this as it is too hard to enforce. You may only discuss problems with me, other students in the class, or the course teaching assistants. The only materials you can reference when working on these problems are your course notes, the course notes of other students in the class, and the assigned textbook. In particular, you may not reference online sources or solutions from previous/other classes. Problem sets should be handed in at the beginning of class on the day they are due. That is, bring a physical copy of the problem set to class to give to me before the lecture begins. If you cannot make class, please make arrangements with me in advance for alternative submission procedures. Problem sets not handed in by the beginning of lecture will be considered late, and 4 points will be deducted. Problem sets not handed until the day after the deadline will have 8 points deducted (slide late problem sets under my door if I am not in my office). Beyond this point, problem sets will not be accepted unless we've agreed in advance on an accommodation. Exams There will be two exams in the course: a midterm and a final. The final exam is not cumulative; that is, it covers material from the second half of the course. Academic Integrity I take academic integrity seriously. To repeat the problem set instructions from above: You can work in groups of at most three people on the problem sets. All students must write up their own answers and record on the top of the problem set any group members they worked with. You many only discuss problems with me, your group members, and teaching assistant. The only materials you can reference when working on these problems are course notes from the current semester and the assigned textbook. In particular, you may not reference online sources or solutions from previous semesters. You may not bring any outside material into exams. Violating these rules will lead to a zero on the assignment and potential reporting to the academic honor council. When in doubt, ask me what is allowed. Schedule Below is the current schedule for the course. I might adjust this schedule as the semester progresses so please keep checking back for the latest version.

I will use the shared whiteboard feature in conjunction with a writing tablet to simulate the blackboard. I'll also make available video recordings of all lectures. We will use the same recurring meeting for all lectures. The link was sent to you via email. Let me know if you need it. Midterm/Final Based on the recommendation of the Dean's office to delay formal assessments until after the move out period, the midterm has been shifted to April 2nd. It still, however, only covers Parts 1 and 2. The midterm will be take home but timed, taking place during the normal lecture period. I will be available via Zoom for questions. Additional time periods can be arranged for students who need accomodations due to issues such as time zone conflicts. More details will be shared as we get closer to the exam date. I will wait until after our midterm to decide on the details for how I will administer the final exam (I want to learn from the midterm experience.) Problem Sets The only change to the problem set process is that you'll now submit them electronically by 12:30 on their due date using a Canvas site for this course. (Instrutions for this electronic submission procedure are pending.) I will also monitor my email carefully, including during scheduled zoom conferences (in case of technical difficulties). Course Overview Description This course explores various techniques used in the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Topics covered include sorting, search trees, hashing, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, graph algorithms and basic complexity theory. Supported by funding from the Mozilla Foundation, and working in conjunction with Georgetown's Ethics Lab, we will also be experimenting this semester with integrating into the curriculum content on ethics and social responsibility in computer science. Your participation and feedback regarding these modules will be much appreciated, as it will help shape the evolution of this innovative endeavor. Textbook The required textbook for this course is Introduction to Algorithms (Third Edition) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein. Most of the topics and examples covered in this course will be adapted from this text. Grading This course focuses on the theoretical aspects of designing and analyzing correct and efficient algorithms. Accordingly, there are no programming projects. Problem set assignments and exams will instead require pencil and paper analysis. In more detail, grades in this course will be based on problem sets, a midterm, and a non-cumulative final. The problem set problems will be graded on the following scale: check plus (correct answer with at most minor issues), check (shows understanding but has at least one major issue), and zero (does not demonstrate a reasonable understanding of the problem, or we could not follow your solution). Each check plus earns you 4 points, each check 2 points, and each zero, of course, 0 points. At the end of the semester, I add up all the points you earned, and this number is your problem set score. Each problem set will be returned to you along with sample solutions, grading notes, and a guide to mapping your point score to a letter grade scale. Though this mapping will vary from problem set to problem set, depending on length and difficulty, in most cases, to earn an A on a problem set you should be aiming to get a check plus on most problems. The midterm will be taken in class and will cover material from the first half of the class. The final exam will be taken during the final exam period and will cover material from the second half of the class. That is, the final exam is not cumulative. The midterm will be returned to you with sample solutions, grading notes, and a guide to mapping your numerical score to a letter grade. In determining your final grade, I will add up the total points you earned on problem sets, the total points you earned on your midterm, and the total points you earned on your final. I will then map your point sum to a final letter grade. To do so, I add to our class grading spreadsheet invented A, B, C, and D students. For each assignment and exam I give the A student the score that corresponds to the middle of the A range, the B student the score that corresponds to the middle of the B range, and so on. At the end of the class, I sum up the scores in these rows to establish a basic point range for A, B, C, and D grades. I use these to help inform the final mapping of your numerical score to a letter grade. Notice, the total points available for the problem sets will add up to be roughly 50% of the total possible points, with the total points available on the midterms and final each adding up to roughly 25% of the available points. If you have any questions about your current course performance please do not hesitate to talk to me. I do not want your final grade to be a surprise.

Description  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that studies how to program computers to reason, learn, perceive, and understand. The lecture portion of the class surveys basic and advanced concepts and techniques of artificial intelligence, including search, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, uncertain reasoning, and machine learning. Specific topics include symbolic computing, state-space search, game playing, theorem proving, rule-based systems, Bayesian networks, probability estimation, rule induction, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, and ethical and philosophical issues. Applications of artificial intelligence are also discussed in domains such as medicine and computer security. Students complete midterm and final exams, and five programming projects using the Java programming language.  Prerequisite: Data Structures (COSC-160) and Advanced Programming (COSC-150).  Required Text:      Artificial intelligence: A modern approach, 3rd Edition, by Russell and Norvig.   Learning Goals  By the end of the semester, students will be able to:      explain the main philosophical stances of artificial intelligence     describe, compare, and contrast the main formalisms used in artificial intelligence     describe, compare, and contrast algorithms used in artificial intelligence for reasoning and for learning     devise and implement algorithms used in artificial intelligence for reasoning and for learning using the Java programming language     explain the main ethical and philosophical issues in artificial intelligence, especially that pertain to machine learning and autonomous systems     describe and critique thought experiments that support or refute strong or general artificial intelligence  Policies  My course policies are designed to supplement the University's Undergraduate Honor System and the CS Department's Honor Policy. Unless stated otherwise when I distribute an assignment, the following is the default for all assignments for this course. I have developed my policies from past teaching experiences and from the CS Department's Honor Code at George Mason University.  I am obligated to refer all suspected cases of academic dishonesty by undergraduate and master's students to Georgetown's Honor Council. I am obligated to refer all suspected cases of academic dishonesty by doctoral students to the dean of the Graduate School. If you have any questions about these policies or how they apply, please discuss such concerns with me during class, during office hours, by e-mail, or using the class's discussion board.  In my experience, students at Georgetown do honest work. The very small percentage of students who have submitted someone else's work as their own did so because they did not manage their time wisely.  Students must always follow proper scholarly practice for all submitted work, whether graded or ungraded and whether a draft or final version of a proposal, paper, program, or problem set. As scholars, we must acknowledge our reliance on the work of others through citation. You can never submit someone else's work as your own without proper attribution. The University assumes that students learned how to properly cite material at their previous institutions. If this is not the case, please let me know.  Indeed, students may be quite adept at and knowledgeable about citing and quoting material from traditional sources, such as books and articles. Typically, we do not have cite facts, common math formulae, or expressions of our own ideas, observations, interpretations, and analyses, However, students new to computer science may not realize that theorems, proofs, algorithms, programs, and code fragments may require the same treatment as any other form of expression.  For convenience, you do not need to cite the course materials, which are the syllabus, sources linked from the syllabus, the course textbook, the class lectures and discussion, posts on the discussion board, and conversations with me and the course's teaching assistants. You must, however, cite the use of any source that is not part of the course materials. If you are unsure about what requires citation or what constitutes proper scholarly practice, please ask me during class, during office hours, by e-mail, or using the discussion board.  I design my courses and assignments so students have what they need to complete the assignments individually without consulting outside resources. I determine the size of and credit for assignments based on the assumption that the work for them is the result of individual effort using only the course resources and materials. Students who use outside resources to complete assignments may not be eligible for full credit. Students who do not acknowledge their use of outside resources to complete assignments may be in violation of my course policies and the university's policies on academic integrity.

Copyright issues aside, if you post your solutions to assessments on the Internet, it is possible that students in future classes will find your solutions and submit them as their own work without attribution. Naturally, students who do so violate my course policies, and the Honor Council will with high probability find them in violation and sanction them. The Honor Council may also find you in violation because you facilitated cheating and violated copyright law and the Web site's terms of service.  I understand that it is often important for securing a job or an internship for students to provide prospective employers with a portfolio of their work. I recommend that students devise a scheme for doing so that does not violate copyright law, does not violate the terms of service of the site on which you have posted material protected by copyright, and does not facilitate cheating.  The following list details acceptable and unacceptable practices:      You can:         obtain assistance in understanding course materials (textbooks, lecture notes, assignments);         obtain assistance in learning to use the computing facilities;         obtain assistance in learning to use special features of a programming language's implementation;         obtain assistance in determining the syntactic correctness of a particular programming language statement or construct;         obtain an explanation of a particular syntactic error;         obtain explanations of compilation or run-time error messages.      You can obtain assistance only from me and the teaching assistants:         in designing the data structures and algorithms used in your solution;         in modifying the design of an algorithm or data structure determined to be faulty;         in implementing your algorithm or data structure in a programming language;         in correcting a faulty implementation of your algorithm or data structure;         in determining the semantic correctness of your program;         in designing an experimental study and interpreting its results.      You can not:         show or give a copy of your work in any amount or form to another student;         post course materials or your solutions for any assessment to any site on the Internet, including sites such as GitHub and CourseHero;         see or receive a copy of someone else's work in any amount or form;         attempt to gain access to files other than your own or those that I designate and authorize;         inspect or retain in your possession another student's work, whether it was given to you by another student, it was found after other student discarded his or her work, or it accidentally came into your possession;         collaborate in any way with someone else in the design, implementation, or logical revision of an algorithm;         use or present as your own any algorithm, data structure, or implementation that is not of your own or of my design, or that is not part of the course materials.         study or incorporate code that others have written, such as code found on the Internet;         attempt to reverse engineer routines used for automatic grading.   Policies dealing logistics:      You have permission to occasionally take digital photos of the material on the board for your personal and course-related use, but you can not post these recordings on the Internet. It is important to understand that all of the course material is covered by copyright, either mine or someone else's.     You should submit all assignments on time. For late projects, there will be a 1% deduction for each minute after the deadline. In the real world, it won't be your grade that decreases. It'll be your stock price.     I grant extensions only to students who have documentation for a medical issue, a family emergency, or an accommodation from the Academic Resource Center. In the cases of a medical issue or a family emergency, it would be best to coordinate with your advising dean since these situations often affect your work in all of your classes.     If you use your laptop for development, you should keep a backup of your projects on a university or department machine (e.g., cs-class) so that if something goes wrong with your submission I can verify that you completed the work for an assignment before the deadline.     You must take the final exam with the section and during the period designated by the Registrar.     It is my job to maintain a constructive learning environment for everyone. Please silence your cell phone and other electronic devices.     The Undergraduate Bulletin stipulates that “[a]ll students are expected to attend all classes...” If you must miss class, be sure to get the lecture notes from a classmate.     It is fine if you must leave class early, arrive late, or leave the room to answer your phone, but you should do so in a manner that does not disturb your fellow students.     In the case of inclement weather that results in the university's closure, we will meet virtually during normal class times using Zoom.

It is important to emphasize that the grade you obtain from Autolab is an initial grade and may not be your final grade. There are many important aspects of a program that are difficult or impossible to assess using automatic grading routines. For example, automatic grading routines can not determine if you have written proper documentation. They can not easily assess if an implementation of an operation is optimally efficient. As a consequence, I start with the initial grade you obtain from Autolab and take further deductions if necessary.  For complete implementations, I use the following distribution as a guide:      40%: Compiles against the autograder     20%: Executes without failure using the autograder     40%: Autograder unit tests     10%: Internal documentation, if required         Purpose of classes and methods explained in documentation comments         Purpose, range, and meaning of identifiers explained, where needed         Complex flow of control explained     10%: Style and formatting         Nested indentation for loops and conditionals         All class, method, and function headers emphasized         Comments set off from code         Vertical alignment of comments, where appropriate         White space between blocks of code (and comments)         Mnemonic identifier names     80%: Algorithm and Implementation         Correct implementation of the operations         Proper object-oriented design and implementation         Appropriate error checking and diagnostic messages         Appropriate data and object types         Correct, clean, organized output format  Notice that an implementation consisting entirely method stubs would obtain an initial grade of 60%. Such an implementation is incomplete, and would be subject to further deductions based on the effort required to implement the required operations.  In addition to the above, the following deductions may be taken if applicable:      20%: Does not compile on cs-class     1–10%: Incomplete or improper submission     1–10%: Debugging or unnecessary output     1–5%: My effort for fixing any minor issue     1–5%: Inefficiently implemented routine     1% per minute: Late deduction  Materials: Readings, Videos, and Links      Autolab, for submitting projects     Piazza, for online discussions.

Description Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that studies how to program computers to reason, learn, perceive, and understand. The lecture portion of the class surveys basic and advanced concepts and techniques of artificial intelligence, including search, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, uncertain reasoning, and machine learning. Specific topics include symbolic computing, state-space search, game playing, theorem proving, rule-based systems, Bayesian networks, probability estimation, rule induction, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, and ethical and philosophical issues. Applications of artificial intelligence are also discussed in domains such as medicine and computer security.

It is important to emphasize that the grade you obtain from Autolab is an initial grade and may not be your final grade. There are many important aspects of a program that are difficult or impossible to assess using automatic grading routines. For example, automatic grading routines can not determine if you have written proper documentation. They can not easily assess if an implementation of an operation is optimally efficient. As a consequence, I start with the initial grade you obtain from Autolab and take further deductions if necessary. For complete implementations, I use the following distribution as a guide: 40%: Compiles against the autograder 20%: Executes without failure using the autograder 40%: Autograder unit tests 10%: Internal documentation, if required Purpose of classes and methods explained in documentation comments Purpose, range, and meaning of identifiers explained, where needed Complex flow of control explained 10%: Style and formatting Nested indentation for loops and conditionals All class, method, and function headers emphasized Comments set off from code Vertical alignment of comments, where appropriate White space between blocks of code (and comments) Mnemonic identifier names 80%: Algorithm and Implementation Correct implementation of the operations Proper object-oriented design and implementation Appropriate error checking and diagnostic messages Appropriate data and object types Correct, clean, organized output format Notice that an implementation consisting entirely method stubs would obtain an initial grade of 60%. Such an implementation is incomplete, and would be subject to further deductions based on the effort required to implement the required operations. In addition to the above, the following deductions may be taken if applicable: 20%: Does not compile on cs-class 1–10%: Incomplete or improper submission 1–10%: Debugging or unnecessary output 1–5%: My effort for fixing any minor issue 1–5%: Inefficiently implemented routine 1% per minute: Late deduction Materials: Readings, Videos, and Links Autolab, for submitting projects Piazza, for online discussions.

Description Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that studies how to program computers to reason, learn, perceive, and understand. The lecture portion of the class surveys basic and advanced concepts and techniques of artificial intelligence, including search, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, uncertain reasoning, and machine learning. Specific topics include symbolic computing, state-space search, game playing, theorem proving, rule-based systems, Bayesian networks, probability estimation, rule induction, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, and ethical and philosophical issues. Applications of artificial intelligence are also discussed in domains such as medicine and computer security. Students complete midterm and final exams, and five programming projects using the Java programming language. Prerequisite: Data Structures (COSC-160) and Advanced Programming (COSC-150). Required Text: Artificial intelligence: A modern approach, 3rd Edition, by Russell and Norvig. Learning Goals By the end of the semester, students will be able to: explain the main philosophical stances of artificial intelligence describe, compare, and contrast the main formalisms used in artificial intelligence describe, compare, and contrast algorithms used in artificial intelligence for reasoning and for learning devise and implement algorithms used in artificial intelligence for reasoning and for learning using the Java programming language explain the main ethical and philosophical issues in artificial intelligence, especially that pertain to machine learning and autonomous systems describe and critique thought experiments that support or refute strong or general artificial intelligence Policies My course policies are designed to supplement the University's Undergraduate Honor System and the CS Department's Honor Policy. Unless stated otherwise when I distribute an assignment, the following is the default for all assignments for this course. I have developed my policies from past teaching experiences and from the CS Department's Honor Code at George Mason University. I am obligated to refer all suspected cases of academic dishonesty by undergraduate and master's students to Georgetown's Honor Council. I am obligated to refer all suspected cases of academic dishonesty by doctoral students to the dean of the Graduate School. If you have any questions about these policies or how they apply, please discuss such concerns with me during class, during office hours, by e-mail, or using the class's discussion board. In my experience, students at Georgetown do honest work. The very small percentage of students who have submitted someone else's work as their own did so because they did not manage their time wisely. Students must always follow proper scholarly practice for all submitted work, whether graded or ungraded and whether a draft or final version of a proposal, paper, program, or problem set. As scholars, we must acknowledge our reliance on the work of others through citation. You can never submit someone else's work as your own without proper attribution. The University assumes that students learned how to properly cite material at their previous institutions. If this is not the case, please let me know. Indeed, students may be quite adept at and knowledgeable about citing and quoting material from traditional sources, such as books and articles. Typically, we do not have cite facts, common math formulae, or expressions of our own ideas, observations, interpretations, and analyses, However, students new to computer science may not realize that theorems, proofs, algorithms, programs, and code fragments may require the same treatment as any other form of expression. For convenience, you do not need to cite the course materials, which are the syllabus, sources linked from the syllabus, the course textbook, the class lectures and discussion, posts on the discussion board, and conversations with me and the course's teaching assistants. You must, however, cite the use of any source that is not part of the course materials. If you are unsure about what requires citation or what constitutes proper scholarly practice, please ask me during class, during office hours, by e-mail, or using the discussion board. I design my courses and assignments so students have what they need to complete the assignments individually without consulting outside resources. I determine the size of and credit for assignments based on the assumption that the work for them is the result of individual effort using only the course resources and materials. Students who use outside resources to complete assignments may not be eligible for full credit. Students who do not acknowledge their use of outside resources to complete assignments may be in violation of my course policies and the university's policies on academic integrity. The materials that I create and use for my courses (“Course Materials”) are my intellectual property. You may not disseminate or reproduce them in any form for public distribution (e.g., sale, exchange, etc.) without my written permission. Course Materials include all written or electronic documents and materials that I provide, including but not limited to syllabi, current and past assessments and their solutions (e.g., exams, homeworks, projects, problem sets, etc.), and presentations such as lectures, videos, slides, etc. Course Materials may only be used by students enrolled in the course for academic (i.e., course-related) purposes. Furthermore, your solutions to assessments are derivative works of my copyrighted material and are therefore subject to that protection because they necessarily incorporate my protected expression. Consequently, you may not further disseminate or reproduce in any form for distribution (e.g., uploading to websites, sale, exchange, etc.) your solutions to assessments. Published course readings (book chapters, articles, reports, etc.) available in Canvas are copyrighted material. I make these works available to students through licensed databases or fair use. They are protected by copyright law, and may not be further disseminated or reproduced in any form for distribution (e.g., uploading to websites, sale, exchange, etc.) without permission of the copyright owner. You can find more information about intellectual property and copyright here: https://www.library.georgetown.edu/copyright. You can find more information about computer acceptable use policy and intellectual property here: https://security.georgetown.edu/it-policies-procedures/computer-systems-aup. Copyright issues aside, if you post your solutions to assessments on the Internet, it is possible that students in future classes will find your solutions and submit them as their own work without attribution. Naturally, students who do so violate my course policies, and the Honor Council will with high probability find them in violation and sanction them. The Honor Council may also find you in violation because you facilitated cheating and violated copyright law and the Web site's terms of service. I understand that it is often important for securing a job or an internship for students to provide prospective employers with a portfolio of their work. I recommend that students devise a scheme for doing so that does not violate copyright law, does not violate the terms of service of the site on which you have posted material protected by copyright, and does not facilitate cheating. The following list details acceptable and unacceptable practices: You can: obtain assistance in understanding course materials (textbooks, lecture notes, assignments); obtain assistance in learning to use the computing facilities; obtain assistance in learning to use special features of a programming language's implementation; obtain assistance in determining the syntactic correctness of a particular programming language statement or construct; obtain an explanation of a particular syntactic error; obtain explanations of compilation or run-time error messages. You can obtain assistance only from me and the teaching assistants: in designing the data structures and algorithms used in your solution; in modifying the design of an algorithm or data structure determined to be faulty; in implementing your algorithm or data structure in a programming language; in correcting a faulty implementation of your algorithm or data structure; in determining the semantic correctness of your program; in designing an experimental study and interpreting its results. You can not: show or give a copy of your work in any amount or form to another student; post course materials or your solutions for any assessment to any site on the Internet, including sites such as GitHub and CourseHero; see or receive a copy of someone else's work in any amount or form; attempt to gain access to files other than your own or those that I designate and authorize; inspect or retain in your possession another student's work, whether it was given to you by another student, it was found after other student discarded his or her work, or it accidentally came into your possession; collaborate in any way with someone else in the design, implementation, or logical revision of an algorithm; use or present as your own any algorithm, data structure, or implementation that is not of your own or of my design, or that is not part of the course materials. study or incorporate code that others have written, such as code found on the Internet; attempt to reverse engineer routines used for automatic grading. Policies dealing logistics: You have permission to occasionally take digital photos of the material on the board for your personal and course-related use, but you can not post these recordings on the Internet. It is important to understand that all of the course material is covered by copyright, either mine or someone else's. You should submit all assignments on time. For late projects, there will be a 1% deduction for each minute after the deadline. In the real world, it won't be your grade that decreases. It'll be your stock price. I grant extensions only to students who have documentation for a medical issue, a family emergency, or an accommodation from the Academic Resource Center. In the cases of a medical issue or a family emergency, it would be best to coordinate with your advising dean since these situations often affect your work in all of your classes. If you use your laptop for development, you should keep a backup of your projects on a university or department machine (e.g., cs-class) so that if something goes wrong with your submission I can verify that you completed the work for an assignment before the deadline. You must take the final exam with the section and during the period designated by the Registrar. It is my job to maintain a constructive learning environment for everyone. Please silence your cell phone and other electronic devices. The Undergraduate Bulletin stipulates that “[a]ll students are expected to attend all classes...” If you must miss class, be sure to get the lecture notes from a classmate. It is fine if you must leave class early, arrive late, or leave the room to answer your phone, but you should do so in a manner that does not disturb your fellow students.

Course Description Our goal is to explore the ethical and social impacts of technological innovation. Stanford has a special responsibility to address these topics in light of its role as a seedbed of Silicon Valley. By integrating perspectives from computer science, philosophy, and social science, the course will provide learning experiences that robustly and holistically examine the impact of technology on humans and societies. The course will challenge students, whatever their choice of major and whatever their career pathway, to think about their role as enablers and shapers of technological change in society. Instead of accepting a common view that what others do with new technologies is their responsibility, students will explore their responsibilities as innovators, designers, coders, engineers, corporate leaders, policymakers, citizens, and consumers. With every new innovation, students will ask: What am I enabling others to do? What responsibilities does this imply for me as an innovator, a citizen, and a human being? The content of our course will be new. We are building, however, on the long history of ethics and CS at Stanford. The CS department began offering courses in this area in the 1980s, taught by Terry Winograd (Computer Science) and Helen Nissenbaum (Philosophy). Eric Roberts (Computer Science) taught classes of several hundred students on Ethics and Computer Science in the 1990s and 2000s and CS182 continues to be taught regularly in a smaller, discussion-focused format. Targeting students from across multiple disciplines, the course will offer learning opportunities to distinct student populations: giving CS students a greater appreciation of the ethical and policy questions that arise in real-world technical contexts, and students from the humanities and social sciences a deeper understanding of the technical topics underlying many of today’s policy and ethical debates. Course Topics The course is structured around four core units, which have been selected primarily for two reasons: (a) to preview critical issues you are likely to play a role in shaping over the next decade and (b) to emphasize topics around which technologists could benefit from greater engagement with domains of knowledge found in other disciplines, including philosophy, social science, and public policy.

Unit Sub-topics of interest Algorithmic Decision-Making ● Use of predictive algorithms in public vs. private settings, with emphasis on the criminal justice system ● Comparative approaches to algorithmic transparency and accountability (e.g., auditing, technological due process) ● Trade-offs between predictive accuracy and competing values (e.g., fairness, transparency, explainability) ● Mapping automated systems onto a society characterized by human judgments, informal norms, and formal rules","['cs', 'ethics', 'public', 'policy', 'technological', 'change', 'cross', 'listed', 'comm', 'ethicsoc', 'phil', 'polisci', 'publpol', 'winter', 'm', 'w', 'f', 'pm', 'pt', 'course', 'website', 'c', 'stanford', 'edu', 'teaching', 'team', 'course', 'staff', 'we', 'assembled', 'interdisciplinary', 'team', 'teaching', 'fellows', 'across', 'university', 'including', 'graduate', 'student', 'background', 'computer', 'science', 'philosophy', 'political', 'science', 'law', 'sociology', 'collectively', 'array', 'relevant', 'professional', 'experience', 'served', 'government', 'worked', 'technology', 'company', 'led', 'initiative', 'address', 'many', 'issue', 'discussing', 'throughout', 'course', 'opportunity', 'interact', 'many', 'different', 'teaching', 'fellows', 'course', 'description', 'our', 'goal', 'explore', 'ethical', 'social', 'impact', 'technological', 'innovation', 'stanford', 'ha', 'special', 'responsibility', 'address', 'topic', 'light', 'role', 'seedbed', 'silicon', 'valley', 'by', 'integrating', 'perspective', 'computer', 'science', 'philosophy', 'social', 'science', 'course', 'provide', 'learning', 'experience', 'robustly', 'holistically', 'examine', 'impact', 'technology', 'human', 'society', 'the', 'course', 'challenge', 'student', 'whatever', 'choice', 'major', 'whatever', 'career', 'pathway', 'think', 'role', 'enablers', 'shaper', 'technological', 'change', 'society', 'instead', 'accepting', 'common', 'view', 'others', 'new', 'technology', 'responsibility', 'student', 'explore', 'responsibility', 'innovator', 'designer', 'coder', 'engineer', 'corporate', 'leader', 'policymakers', 'citizen', 'consumer', 'with', 'every', 'new', 'innovation', 'student', 'ask', 'what', 'i', 'enabling', 'others', 'what', 'responsibility', 'doe', 'imply', 'innovator', 'citizen', 'human', 'the', 'content', 'course', 'new', 'we', 'building', 'however', 'long', 'history', 'ethic', 'cs', 'stanford', 'the', 'cs', 'department', 'began', 'offering', 'course', 'area', 'computer', 'science', 'philosophy', 'computer', 'science', 'taught', 'class', 'several', 'hundred', 'student', 'ethics', 'computer', 'science', 'cs', 'continues', 'taught', 'regularly', 'smaller', 'discussion', 'focused', 'format', 'targeting', 'student', 'across', 'multiple', 'discipline', 'course', 'offer', 'learning', 'opportunity', 'distinct', 'student', 'population', 'giving', 'cs', 'student', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'ethical', 'policy', 'question', 'arise', 'real', 'world', 'technical', 'context', 'student', 'humanity', 'social', 'science', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'technical', 'topic', 'underlying', 'many', 'today', 'policy', 'ethical', 'debate', 'course', 'topics', 'the', 'course', 'structured', 'around', 'four', 'core', 'unit', 'selected', 'primarily', 'two', 'reason', 'preview', 'critical', 'issue', 'likely', 'play', 'role', 'shaping', 'next', 'decade', 'b', 'emphasize', 'topic', 'around', 'technologist', 'could', 'benefit', 'greater', 'engagement', 'domain', 'knowledge', 'found', 'discipline', 'including', 'philosophy', 'social', 'science', 'public', 'policy', 'unit', 'sub', 'topic', 'interest', 'algorithmic', 'decision', 'making', 'use', 'predictive', 'algorithm', 'public', 'v', 'private', 'setting', 'emphasis', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'comparative', 'approach', 'algorithmic', 'transparency', 'accountability', 'e', 'g', 'auditing', 'technological', 'due', 'process', 'trade', 'offs', 'predictive', 'accuracy', 'competing', 'value', 'e', 'g', 'fairness', 'transparency', 'explainability', 'mapping', 'automated', 'system', 'onto', 'society', 'characterized', 'human', 'judgment', 'informal', 'norm', 'formal', 'rule']"

Mulligan GSI: Emma Lurie & Zoe Kahn    Course Overview: This course provides an introduction to social, political, legal and ethical issues surrounding data  and society through lectures and labs that  provide students with an opportunity to work with frameworks, processes, and tools for attending to these issues in practice. Concepts addressed include: the contingent and contextual nature of data; research ethics; privacy and surveillance; bias and discrimination; and oversight and accountability. These issues are addressed throughout the lifecycle of data — from collection to storage to analysis and application. The course places data in social and political context and emphasizes strategies, processes, and tools for attending to ethical and legal issues in data science work. Course assignments emphasize researcher and practitioner reflexivity, allowing students to explore their own social, political, and ethical commitments.  Course Structure: Tuesday lecture (1.5 hours); Thursday interactive lab activities (1.5 hours)   Learning Objectives:  Understand that the decisions data scientists and technologists make embed values and have political consequences that impact people, society, and the environment Identify and articulate basic ethical frameworks, policy frameworks, and legal obligations relevant to data science with data about humans Understand that professional responsibility extends beyond legal compliance Understand that technical solutions are one of many ways, including law and policy, to prevent or remediate harms Understand and work with the contested and contextual nature of concepts including, privacy, fairness, deception, discrimination, bias, and opacit Understand  the differential impacts of sociotechnical systems on historically and traditionally marginalized groups Use methods from the course to identify intended and unintended consequences of technical systems Reflexively articulate critiques and/or justifications of their own work and education in data science Understand workplace practices that can support reflection and action on social and political values Be able to articulate reasons for resisting, constraining, and embracing different uses of data science grounded in different theories and frameworks    Week 1: No lab      Weekly reading:  Winner, ""Do Artifacts Have Politics?""

Week 2: Purging Voter Rolls (template) Lab Overview: In this lab, students explore how a seemingly simple technical task -- matching items across databases to purge people from the voter rolls -- can be an incredibly complex one with widespread social and political implications. This lab asks students to consider how they might design a system to remove people who have died and people convicted of felonies from the voter rolls. In doing so, students consider (a) limitations of different technical designs (b) how technical systems may have different implications depending upon the data used (i.e., purging people who have died vs. people convicted of felonies), and (c) how the various system designs may disproportionately disadvantage particular groups of people.

",INFO 188  Behind the Data Humans and Values    UC Berkeley School of Information Fall 2020  Virtual  140 students        Course Overview This course provides an introduction to social political legal and ethical issues surrounding data  and society through lectures and labs that  provide students with an opportunity to work with frameworks processes and tools for attending to these issues in practice Concepts addressed include the contingent and contextual nature of data research ethics privacy and surveillance bias and discrimination and oversight and accountability These issues are addressed throughout the lifecycle of data — from collection to storage to analysis and application The course places data in social and political context and emphasizes strategies processes and tools for attending to ethical and legal issues in data science work Course assignments emphasize researcher and practitioner reflexivity allowing students to explore their own social political and ethical commitments  Course Structure Tuesday lecture 15 hours Thursday interactive lab activities 15 hours   Learning Objectives  Understand that the decisions data scientists and technologists make embed values and have political consequences that impact people society and the environment Identify and articulate basic ethical frameworks policy frameworks and legal obligations relevant to data science with data about humans Understand that professional responsibility extends beyond legal compliance Understand that technical solutions are one of many ways including law and policy to prevent or remediate harms Understand and work with the contested and contextual nature of concepts including privacy fairness deception discrimination bias and opacit Understand  the differential impacts of sociotechnical systems on historically and traditionally marginalized groups Use methods from the course to identify intended and unintended consequences of technical systems Reflexively articulate critiques andor justifications of their own work and education in data science Understand workplace practices that can support reflection and action on social and political values Be able to articulate reasons for resisting constraining and embracing different uses of data science grounded in different theories and frameworks     No lab  Winner Do Artifacts Have Politics Modern Technology Problem or Opportunity Jack Dorsey on Twitter’s Mistakes Purging Voter Rolls template Lab Overview In this lab students explore how a seemingly simple technical task  matching items across databases to purge people from the voter rolls  can be an incredibly complex one with widespread social and political implications This lab asks students to consider how they might design a system to remove people who have died and people convicted of felonies from the voter rolls In doing so students consider a limitations of different technical designs b how technical systems may have different implications depending upon the data used ie purging people who have died vs people convicted of felonies and c how the various system designs may disproportionately disadvantage particular groups of people Conceptualizing Data In The data revolution Talking Tech Handling Human Names Are States Purging Or Cleaning Voter Registration Rolls Week 3 The Strategic Actions of RideSharing Drivers template  Lab Overview In this lab students explore the strategic actions taken by drivers of ridesharing platforms to exert control over algorithmic systems and corporations In doing so students grapple with the line between legitimate forms of algorithmic control and gaming in particular by considering the action from the perspective of various actors ie driver rider government company taxi

UC Berkeley,Data 4AC: Data and Justice,https://data.berkeley.edu/data-4ac-data-and-justice,Found," Course description  DATA 4AC engages students with fundamental questions of justice in relation to data and computing in American society. Data collection, visualization, and analysis have been entangled in the struggle for racial and social justice because they can make injustice visible, imaginable, and thus actionable. Data has also been used to oppress minoritized communities and institutionalize, rationalize, and naturalize systems of racial violence. The course examines key sites of justice involving data (such as citizenship, policing, prisons, environment, and health). Along with critical social science tools, students gain introductory experience and do collaborative and creative projects with data science using real-world data. After completing this course, students will be able to See the co-production of justice with data in the United States, specifically in racial contexts      See how justice is a historically contingent category (value-laden, institutionally-embedded), that is co-produced with data technologies     Identify the fundamental constitutive role of race in matters of data in American life, and how data tools can embed or counteract racialized systems of power     Recognize the many sites of individual and collective life where justice is at stake in relation to data, in both explicit and hidden ways     Understand different approaches to justice (theoretical) and their attendant practices, including why we talk about ""fairness"" in relation to data technology     Recognize how data science and technology have been used in the pursuit of justice at the same time as they have been tools for perpetuating injustice, particularly in relation to American cultures.  Recognize the mark of American histories in today's sociotechnical systems      See the historical import of American race relations and history of slavery for the data science tools used today     Articulate the importance of American history for assessing the importance of justice in today's world  Value and use diverse forms of knowing      Learn to listen to, recognize, and respect ways of knowing and experiencing the world by people whose positionality is different from one's own, including voices and epistemologies not usually represented in the Academy     Understand the value of interpretive and critical ways of knowing and gain experience bringing them into technical discussions     Develop an expansive understanding of what data science expertise is: it involves ways of knowing about issues of power and values beyond domain knowledge, statistics, and computing     Gain an introduction to the HCE toolkit, including concepts from STS, History, and Philosophy  Re-imagine and build just human-technology futures with others      Understand how the questions we ask in data science shape the answers that we give     Gain experience with basic data science tools and approaches, such as Jupyter notebooks and data visualization, that can be used in the service of understanding, critiquing, and changing the world     Use this expertise to build more just data futures (including building technologies differently, debating in communities about justice in the contemporary world, and reimagining possibilities of our sociotechnical systems, e.g. policing, education, health)  DATA 4AC examines the lived experience of data and justice by different American races, ethnicities, and cultures, foregrounding in particular the experiences of African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Chicanx/Latinx communities, and Asian Americans. It invites students to consider the ways in which groups' experiences are informed by their different positionings in an American society characterized by systemic racial oppression and in a context in which racial stratification co-evolves with data technologies. Students learn key theoretical concepts from critical race theory, queer and feminist studies, ethnic studies, and science, technology, and society (STS) that enable them to analyze and critique the power of technology in the constitution of American cultures. Relation to other courses and parts of the Data Science program  This course uses humanistic and social scientific lenses to engage students with key issues in the social context and ethical practice of data science. It provides entry-level, guided hands-on experience with easily accessible data science platforms and tools. It has no prerequisites. Students with previous computational or statistical experience will have no advantage over others.   For students who find they wish to do further studies in data science, Data 4AC can be followed by Data 6 (Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data, satisfying the L&S SBS breadth requirement) and/or Data 8 (Foundations of Data Science, satisfying the L&S Quantitative Reasoning requirement).   For students in the Data Science major, Data 4AC can serve as a lower-division class for Domain Emphases in Inequalities in Society; Organizations and the Economy; Social Welfare, Health, and Poverty; and Social Policy and Law. Data 4AC is a lower-division course and does not meet the upper-division HCE requirement for the Data Science major. Data 4AC Syllabus A week-by-week plan of the semester.

DATA 4AC engages students with fundamental questions of justice in relation to data and computing in American society. Data collection, visualization, and analysis have been entangled in the struggle for racial and social justice because they can make injustice visible, imaginable, and thus actionable. Data has also been used to oppress minoritized communities and institutionalize, rationalize, and naturalize systems of racial violence. The course examines key sites of justice involving data (such as citizenship, policing, prisons, environment, and health). Along with critical social science tools, students gain introductory experience and do collaborative and creative projects with data science using real-world data.
After completing this course, students will be able to
See the co-production of justice with data in the United States, specifically in racial contexts
See how justice is a historically contingent category (value-laden, institutionally-embedded), that is co-produced with data technologies
Identify the fundamental constitutive role of race in matters of data in American life, and how data tools can embed or counteract racialized systems of power
Recognize the many sites of individual and collective life where justice is at stake in relation to data, in both explicit and hidden ways
Understand different approaches to justice (theoretical) and their attendant practices, including why we talk about ""fairness"" in relation to data technology
Recognize how data science and technology have been used in the pursuit of justice at the same time as they have been tools for perpetuating injustice, particularly in relation to American cultures.
Recognize the mark of American histories in today's sociotechnical systems
See the historical import of American race relations and history of slavery for the data science tools used today
Articulate the importance of American history for assessing the importance of justice in today's world
Value and use diverse forms of knowing
Learn to listen to, recognize, and respect ways of knowing and experiencing the world by people whose positionality is different from one's own, including voices and epistemologies not usually represented in the Academy
Understand the value of interpretive and critical ways of knowing and gain experience bringing them into technical discussions
Develop an expansive understanding of what data science expertise is: it involves ways of knowing about issues of power and values beyond domain knowledge, statistics, and computing
Gain an introduction to the HCE toolkit, including concepts from STS, History, and Philosophy
Re-imagine and build just human-technology futures with others
Understand how the questions we ask in data science shape the answers that we give
Gain experience with basic data science tools and approaches, such as Jupyter notebooks and data visualization, that can be used in the service of understanding, critiquing, and changing the world
Use this expertise to build more just data futures (including building technologies differently, debating in communities about justice in the contemporary world, and reimagining possibilities of our sociotechnical systems, e.g. policing, education, health)
DATA 4AC examines the lived experience of data and justice by different American races, ethnicities, and cultures, foregrounding in particular the experiences of African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Chicanx/Latinx communities, and Asian Americans. It invites students to consider the ways in which groups' experiences are informed by their different positionings in an American society characterized by systemic racial oppression and in a context in which racial stratification co-evolves with data technologies. Students learn key theoretical concepts from critical race theory, queer and feminist studies, ethnic studies, and science, technology, and society (STS) that enable them to analyze and critique the power of technology in the constitution of American cultures.
Relation to other courses and parts of the Data Science program
This course uses humanistic and social scientific lenses to engage students with key issues in the social context and ethical practice of data science. It provides entry-level, guided hands-on experience with easily accessible data science platforms and tools. It has no prerequisites. Students with previous computational or statistical experience will have no advantage over others. 
For students who find they wish to do further studies in data science, Data 4AC can be followed by Data 6 (Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data, satisfying the L&S SBS breadth requirement) and/or Data 8 (Foundations of Data Science, satisfying the L&S Quantitative Reasoning requirement). 
For students in the Data Science major, Data 4AC can serve as a lower-division class for Domain Emphases in Inequalities in Society; Organizations and the Economy; Social Welfare, Health, and Poverty; and Social Policy and Law. Data 4AC is a lower-division course and does not meet the upper-division HCE requirement for the Data Science major.

Data-driven services and artificial intelligence-powered devices now shape innumerable aspects of our lives. Beneath the surface of these technologies, computational and increasingly autonomous techniques that operate on large, ever-evolving datasets are revolutionizing how people act in and know the world. These new tools, systems, and infrastructures have profound consequences for how we think of ourselves, relate to one another, organize collective life, and envision desirable futures.   This course teaches you to use the tools of applied historical thinking and Science, Technology, and Society (STS) to recognize, analyze, and shape the human contexts and ethics of data. It prepares you to engage as a knowledgeable, skillful, and responsible citizen and professional in the varied arenas of our datafied world. You will learn to address:      How does data science transform how people live and how societies function?       How do cultures and values inform how data-driven tools are developed and deployed?      What assumptions do data-enabled algorithms and tools carry with them?      What projections does AI make on the future?      How can we shape the outcomes we want to see?  If you intend to major in Data Science, the course meets the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of Berkeley’s Data Science major. It gives you systematic exposure and reflective practice in the human choices and social structures that intrinsically shape your work.  If you don’t intend to major in Data Science, the course will jumpstart your knowledge and strengthen your capacity to take part in guiding our datafied world. The course carries the broad, inclusive spirit of Berkeley’s Data Science curriculum into the area of human society and collective choices.

Data-driven services and artificial intelligence-powered devices now shape innumerable aspects of our lives. Beneath the surface of these technologies, computational and increasingly autonomous techniques that operate on large, ever-evolving datasets are revolutionizing how people act in and know the world. These new tools, systems, and infrastructures have profound consequences for how we think of ourselves, relate to one another, organize collective life, and envision desirable futures.   This course teaches you to use the tools of applied historical thinking and Science, Technology, and Society (STS) to recognize, analyze, and shape the human contexts and ethics of data. It prepares you to engage as a knowledgeable, skillful, and responsible citizen and professional in the varied arenas of our datafied world. You will learn to address:      How does data science transform how people live and how societies function?       How do cultures and values inform how data-driven tools are developed and deployed?      What assumptions do data-enabled algorithms and tools carry with them?      What projections does AI make on the future?      How can we shape the outcomes we want to see?  If you intend to major in Data Science, the course meets the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of Berkeley’s Data Science major. It gives you systematic exposure and reflective practice in the human choices and social structures that intrinsically shape your work.  If you don’t intend to major in Data Science, the course will jumpstart your knowledge and strengthen your capacity to take part in guiding our datafied world. The course carries the broad, inclusive spirit of Berkeley’s Data Science curriculum into the area of human society and collective choices. Fall 2020, MWF 3 - 4pm, plus sections / On-line, with synchronous and asynchronous components  The challenge for modern societies is to develop sufficiently powerful and systematic understanding of technology for us to know where the possibilities lie for meaningful political action and responsible governance.

UChicago,BUSN 32200: Artificial Intelligence,https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/2019-01/ppha38829_artificialintelligence_ludwig_winter2019.pdf,Found," Course Syllabus Instructor: Jens Ludwig Time and Location: Mondays 1:30-4:30pm, Keller Center 0021 Contact: jludwig@uchicago.edu Office Hours: Teaching Assistant: Rafael Batista [rafael.batista@chicagobooth.edu] and Megan Kang [megankang@uchicago.edu] Course Description It is hard to name a sector that will not be dramatically affected by artificial intelligence (or machine learning), from the private sector to government and nonprofits. There are many excellent courses that teach you the mechanics behind these innovations -- helping you develop an engineering skill set. This course takes a different approach. It is aimed at people who want to deploy these tools, either in business or policy, whether through start-ups or within a large organization. While this requires some knowledge of how these tools work, that is only a small part of the equation, just as knowing how an engine works is a small part of understanding how to drive. What is really needed is an understanding of what these tools do well, and what they do badly. This course focuses on giving you a functional, rather than mechanistic, understanding. By the end, you should be an expert at identifying ideal (and problematic) use-cases and thereby well- placed to create new products, businesses and policies that use artificial intelligence. Prerequisites There are no formal requirements for this class although we assume students have familiarity with basic concepts in statistics and regression analysis. Format The course is intended to be highly interactive, where students are expected to contribute their ideas to the discussion. There will be a series of activities and experiential material which will require active participation. Throughout the term the modules are designed to craft a simpler mental model of AI, starting with the fundamentals of what exactly makes AI so powerful and going through to what are good (and bad) uses of AI and why. Students should expect a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, discussions, and guest speakers. Requirements and Grading Considering the aim of the course is to develop a stronger, intuitive understanding of AI, there will be no in-class exams. Instead, students will be expected to complete 7 take- home assignments--memos--that will help digest the material we are teaching. Students will also be required to complete a final project which they will be expected to complete outside of class. Participation (15%): Students are expected to participate in class. This involves coming to class prepared and playing an active role in discussions. Take-Home Assignments (25%): Each of weeks 1-7. Submit memos via Canvas.  For weeks 1 - 6 memos are due Friday (so Jan 11, 18, 25, Feb 1, 8, 15) your 1-2 page memo (500 words suggested) will describe one of the following: o Critical. Find an article in the popular press, a startup or a policy proposal that illustrates one of the pitfalls we discussed in class - or is somewhat related to something discussed in class. You are looking for something incomplete, sensationalistic or just plain wrong/misleading. Describe what it is and the error. o Generative. Find an interesting new AI application e.g. “I could apply AI to solve...” Again ideally you’d build on the material you are learning in class. o Feel free to use bullet points and lists. We reward clarity. We suggest writing 1000 words and then editing out verbage to reach 500 words: brevity is meant to force clarity, not to reduce content. Each week we will pick the best of the memos to feature in class. These chosen memos will be given extra credit.  For week 7, memos are due by Thursday (February 21): These memos describe potential candidates for your final project and are written jointly, one memo per team. The memo should include a long list (> 3) of candidates; as well starring 1- 3 candidates for a shortlist. We will read these before office hours so each idea should be described in enough detail that office hours can be used to sift through the candidates rather than describe them. The better your memos, the more useful will be class time. Checklists (20%): Submitted via Canvas Wednesday March 20. You will be given a sequence of blank checklists on the first day of class. Throughout the lectures we will ‘populate’ these checklists. It is your job to take the suggestions in class (and whatever additional ideas you have that are inspired by the class discussion) and populate these checklists. We suggest making them initially very long, and then to winnow down. On March 2 you will submit your final checklists. Written in your own words checklists should ideally make practical the lessons of the class; and allow you to use them in your career going forward. Final Project (40%): Working in teams of 5-6 you will develop a project of your own - from conception to pitch. The project will be either a startup, a policy project or an internal project for a corporate. The outputs will be: 1. A poster to be displayed on Monday March 4 in class; 2. A pitch deck due Monday March 11 (all teams will submit and some will be chosen, based on their poster, to present to class on March 11); and 3. A longer write up (a business plan, a policy memo or a strategy memo) that is due on Wednesday March 21. Objectives and Goals This course aims to equip students with a functional, rather than a mechanical, understanding of AI. Through a series of interactive lessons students will develop a better intuition for AI applications, helping students become expert at identifying ideal use-cases and thereby well-placed to create new products, businesses and policies that use artificial intelligence. Our goal is to make students smarter consumers of AI. The class is intended as a complement to, not substitute for, standard machine learning classes that focus on the nuts and bolts of how to be an algorithm producer. But there is a distinct set of intuitions that are under-developed in standard machine learning classes, and perhaps under- appreciated even by people who engage in industrial-strength machine learning as their profession. We hope that by the end of the quarter each of you will be positioned to tell Netflix, with their giant team of data scientists, something that they currently only dimly understand -- or if they understand it, they and their C-suite executives do not fully appreciate how critical it is to the company’s entire future as a business (or similarly for, say, the office of a big-city chief information officer). More generally by the end of the course, students will have:  A framework for thinking about and finding new opportunities to apply AI  A series of “checklists” to help think through key questions like is this a feasible project involving AI, or should I worry about bias in the algorithm in this application  An understanding of signals, or useful data which exists in the environment, that people don’t typically know to look for  Both an “entrepreneurial” as well as a “systems-wide” way of thinking about AI Students should also know that this course will NOT teach:  How to build AI systems  How to program code  How to estimate data models  The mathematical formalisms behind AI or machine learning algorithms The class, therefore, does not require a background in programming. It does, however, require enough understanding of key statistical concepts such as mean, variance, sampling and correlation. The course is set up to avoid heavy mathematical notation and formalism; thus imposing a heavy demand for critical thinking.

By the end, you should be an expert at identifying ideal (and problematic) use-cases and thereby well- placed to create new products, businesses and policies that use artificial intelligence. Prerequisites There are no formal requirements for this class although we assume students have familiarity with basic concepts in statistics and regression analysis. Format The course is intended to be highly interactive, where students are expected to contribute their ideas to the discussion. There will be a series of activities and experiential material which will require active participation. Throughout the term the modules are designed to craft a simpler mental model of AI, starting with the fundamentals of what exactly makes AI so powerful and going through to what are good (and bad) uses of AI and why. Students should expect a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, discussions, and guest speakers. Requirements and Grading Considering the aim of the course is to develop a stronger, intuitive understanding of AI, there will be no in-class exams. Instead, students will be expected to complete 7 take- home assignments--memos--that will help digest the material we are teaching. Students will also be required to complete a final project which they will be expected to complete outside of class. Participation (15%): Students are expected to participate in class. This involves coming to class prepared and playing an active role in discussions. Take-Home Assignments (25%): Each of weeks 1-7. Submit memos via Canvas.  For weeks 1 - 6 memos are due Friday (so Jan 11, 18, 25, Feb 1, 8, 15) your 1-2 page memo (500 words suggested) will describe one of the following: o Critical. Find an article in the popular press, a startup or a policy proposal that illustrates one of the pitfalls we discussed in class - or is somewhat related to something discussed in class. You are looking for something incomplete, sensationalistic or just plain wrong/misleading. Describe what it is and the error. o Generative. Find an interesting new AI application e.g. “I could apply AI to solve...” Again ideally you’d build on the material you are learning in class. o Feel free to use bullet points and lists. We reward clarity. We suggest writing 1000 words and then editing out verbage to reach 500 words: brevity is meant to force clarity, not to reduce content. Each week we will pick the best of the memos to feature in class. These chosen memos will be given extra credit.  For week 7, memos are due by Thursday (February 21): These memos describe potential candidates for your final project and are written jointly, one memo per team. The memo should include a long list (> 3) of candidates; as well starring 1- 3 candidates for a shortlist. We will read these before office hours so each idea should be described in enough detail that office hours can be used to sift through the candidates rather than describe them. The better your memos, the more useful will be class time. Checklists (20%): Submitted via Canvas Wednesday March 20. You will be given a sequence of blank checklists on the first day of class. Throughout the lectures we will ‘populate’ these checklists. It is your job to take the suggestions in class (and whatever additional ideas you have that are inspired by the class discussion) and populate these checklists. We suggest making them initially very long, and then to winnow down. On March 2 you will submit your final checklists. Written in your own words checklists should ideally make practical the lessons of the class; and allow you to use them in your career going forward. Final Project (40%): Working in teams of 5-6 you will develop a project of your own - from conception to pitch. The project will be either a startup, a policy project or an internal project for a corporate. The outputs will be: 1. A poster to be displayed on Monday March 4 in class; 2. A pitch deck due Monday March 11 (all teams will submit and some will be chosen, based on their poster, to present to class on March 11); and 3. A longer write up (a business plan, a policy memo or a strategy memo) that is due on Wednesday March 21. Objectives and Goals This course aims to equip students with a functional, rather than a mechanical, understanding of AI. Through a series of interactive lessons students will develop a better intuition for AI applications, helping students become expert at identifying ideal use-cases and thereby well-placed to create new products, businesses and policies that use artificial intelligence. Our goal is to make students smarter consumers of AI. The class is intended as a complement to, not substitute for, standard machine learning classes that focus on the nuts and bolts of how to be an algorithm producer. But there is a distinct set of intuitions that are under-developed in standard machine learning classes, and perhaps under- appreciated even by people who engage in industrial-strength machine learning as their profession. We hope that by the end of the quarter each of you will be positioned to tell Netflix, with their giant team of data scientists, something that they currently only dimly understand -- or if they understand it, they and their C-suite executives do not fully appreciate how critical it is to the company’s entire future as a business (or similarly for, say, the office of a big-city chief information officer). More generally by the end of the course, students will have:  A framework for thinking about and finding new opportunities to apply AI  A series of “checklists” to help think through key questions like is this a feasible project involving AI, or should I worry about bias in the algorithm in this application  An understanding of signals, or useful data which exists in the environment, that people don’t typically know to look for  Both an “entrepreneurial” as well as a “systems-wide” way of thinking about AI Students should also know that this course will NOT teach:  How to build AI systems  How to program code  How to estimate data models  The mathematical formalisms behind AI or machine learning algorithms The class, therefore, does not require a background in programming. It does, however, require enough understanding of key statistical concepts such as mean, variance, sampling and correlation. The course is set up to avoid heavy mathematical notation and formalism; thus imposing a heavy demand for critical thinking. ","['it', 'hard', 'name', 'sector', 'dramatically', 'affected',

Course Overview
This course introduces students to the critical study of data through the landscape of networked
information and communication technologies (ICTs)—their history, present, and future. It will
examine the social impact and technical developments of data technologies, defined as any
system designed to gather, process, or distribute information and data through network
architecture. Given this broad definition, we will consider a wide range of data technologies:
from databases, to mobile apps, to data centers, and more. One goal for the course is to
approach “data” from different information studies perspectives. We will do this in two ways.
First, by exploring contemporary research on the impact of data technologies in society; and
second, using information studies theories and frameworks to explore data in society.
Given the broadness of the topic, the course is loosely structured around weekly themes. While
neither historically nor thematically exhaustive, these themes capture significant horizons in the
history and present of data, both in terms of technical innovation and social change in society.
We will be especially concerned with how information professionals and information institutions
figure into these themes, and how our roles may change. While it is usual to cast a distinction
between technical and social dimensions when discussing technology, in this course we
consider technological innovation as a complex process involving not only technical objects, but
also people, ideas, organization, social coordination, money, politics, and culture.
By the end of the course, students will be familiar with the history of data structures and
databases, the affordances that the internet and mobile networks have had on the rise of data
collection contexts, and the social and political debates surrounding the shifts to platforms and
algorithms in these collection contexts, including information created and transmitted with
mobile devices and mobile networks. One goal is for participants to acquire the investigative
skills necessary to assess how technological innovations such as tacit data collection affect
society—creating new opportunities and ethical dilemmas. Another goal is to learn about the
history, standardization, and commercialization of personal and community data in the US and
throughout the world.
Course Objectives
The approach of this course is to expose participants to a range of data technologies that
currently shape and have a history of shaping our everyday lives. The student will expand their
knowledge base about the history of data collection, database technology, internet
infrastructures and network architecture, develop critical skills in applying it to ICTs, and by the
end of the course you will:
● Define the conceptual and theoretical dimensions of data and metadata from an
information studies perspectives.
● Learn historical facts about data infrastructures that allow you to understand how
technological innovation is a complex process involving people, ideas, social
coordination, money, and culture.
● Become familiar with the fundamental approaches, debates and themes of database
technologies over the second half of the twentieth century and the beginning of the
twenty-first century, including how data applications currently figure into information
institutions.
● Review, critique, and evaluate how the practice and implementation of data technologies
are changing various facets of society
● You will learn concepts and methods that allow you to identify and analyze emerging
technologies and innovations in order to recognize and implement relevant
technological, ethical, or policy improvements
● You should learn to write clearly and concisely about complex social and technological
phenomena.
Method of instruction
Each week we shall discuss a small set of readings, all of which are required (recommended
readings will sometimes be provided). It is important that everyone comes to class well prepared
and having read the material ready to discuss the week’s readings. After discussing the
readings, each week will feature a study of data that showcases a different way that individuals,
institutions, or a community of experts creates, understands, uses, and applies data in different
contexts. There is now an increasing amount of scholarly research in the area, and there is no
way to cover it comprehensively, but we’ll cover a number of themes, including:
● Defining data, defining critical data studies
● Personal data and the self
● Data capitalism
● Critical methods
● Human rights
● Bias and risk
● Capturing data
● Infrastructures
● Data Science and data analytics
● Data Centers
● Open data, governance and participation
● Algorithms
Course Readings and Materials
All course readings are available on the course Canvas site or available online. Please make
sure to complete all readings before coming to class each week. You will need to do additional
readings and outside research to complete your final paper.
Course Objectives
The course is intended to enable you to:
1. Define the conceptual and theoretical dimensions of big data.
2. Review big data technologies
3. Critique the practice of big data tools.
4. Evaluate how data collection and data analytics is changing various facets of society
5. Professional craft of research--reading analytically, critiquing readings, providing
constructive criticisms, communicating effectively in your writing and oral communication skills.
Basic guidelines for discussion
This is a seminar style discussion course. Course participants will be expected to discuss the
readings each week. Here are some basic guidelines.
Generosity. All readings selected for the syllabus are insightful and theoretically innovative. If
you find yourself rejecting an argument in toto, this indicates your reading is insufficiently
generous.
Provisionality. You are allowed (indeed, encouraged) to think out loud, say something and
then take it back, and speak in a provisional manner, knowing that those around you will be
patient, supportive, and slow to take offense.
Community. Some individuals are quite comfortable speaking at length: this is desirable, but I
may ask persons to wrap up their comments, or to solicit comments from anyone.
Active participation. This course is designed for students who are pursuing research in
information science and related fields, it is open to students from all campus units but will be
taught at the graduate level. If you are not interested in reading to discuss materials in class at
length, this may not be the course for you.
Time Commitment
This course requires a weekly time commitment. From the University’s general catalog, “The
credit value of courses is expressed in semester hours. Most courses are designed to require
approximately three hours of work a week throughout the semester for each semester hour of
credit given; that is, for each hour a class meets, an average of two additional hours of
preparation is expected of the student. The time requirement in the laboratory, field, or studio
varies with the nature of the subject and the aims of a course, so there is no fixed ratio of
laboratory to class hours.” Given that we’ll meet approximately 2-3 hours each week, a
minimum of 6 hours per week outside of class is expected for an onsite class of 3 hours of
instruction.
Course Policies
Instructor Communication: E-mail is the official mode of communication for the university and
the most reliable means of contact for me. It is always helpful if your e-mail includes a targeted
subject line that begins with “INF 384M.” Do not use the messaging facilities in Canvas; these
messages do not arrive in my e-mail in-box. Please allow a 24-hour window for email responses
and plan accordingly. Please limit emails to 5 sentences or less. If your query about a reading or
an assignment for the class takes more than 5 sentences to express, please come see me face
to face in office hours. If you do not receive a sufficient answer to a question in more than one
follow-up email (that is, a total of 2 personal emails from me) about the same question, please
come meet with me. If you cannot make office hours, please email me to arrange an appointment.
These policies are based on my belief in the sanctity and value of high-bandwidth communication
(that is, face to face conversations).
Classroom Etiquette: Please come on time to class prepared, bringing soft or hard copies of
readings for reference; bring appropriate tools for writing and note taking. Bring personal
machines powered up, or plug them in before class begins, silence phones. Drinks are welcome
but food is not. Please eat before class or during the break period.
Habits of mind: Respect for others; imagination; wonder; willingness to try and fail in front of
others; empathy for others—in the past, present and future. I will discuss what I mean by habits
of mind on the first day and throughout the course.
Copyright Notice: These materials may be protected by copyright. United States copyright law,
17 USC section 101, et seq., in addition to University policy and procedures, prohibit unauthorized
duplication or retransmission of course materials.
Statement on Classroom Recording: To ensure the free and open discussion of ideas, students
may not record classroom lectures, discussion and/or activities without the advance written
permission of the instructor, and any such recording properly approved in advance can be used
solely for the student’s own private use.
On original work: cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated. If an assignment turned in for
credit is found to have been plagiarized, you will receive a grade of 0 points and a formal
reprimand in your student file. You will be subject to the University’s disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course.
Late assignments: I do not accept late assignments. Students who anticipate difficulties with
completing assignments on time should consult with the instructor as soon as possible so that 
alternate solutions can be discussed. When negotiated in advance, arrangements can often be
made.
Attendance: Attendance is not taken. You do not need to inform me of absences, nor do you
need to “make up” anything if you are absent. While participation is an important part of your
grade, and attendance is important, there are no specific requirements for mandatory attendance.
However, please be aware that a substantial in-class component of the course will be hands-on
labs that are successive and cumulatively build skills. Missing a class may impact your ability to
follow along in the next week’s lab component.
Style manual: Please use the American Psychological Association’s style manual. In particular,
please be sure to follow its citation formats and rules on language bias.
Gun policy: Please ask me about my policy on guns in my office when you visit.
University Policies
Religious holy days: A student who misses classes or other required activities, including
examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in
advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an
assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.
Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence: All students should become familiar with the
University's official e-mail student notification policy. It is the student's responsibility to keep the
University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail address. Students are expected to check
e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related
communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is
recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text
of this policy and instructions for updating your e-mail address are available at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564
Documented Disability Statement: You will need to provide documentation to the Dean of
Student’s Office so the most appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized
services are available on campus through Services for Students with Disabilities (SSB 4.104, 471-
6259). Any student who requires special accommodations must obtain a letter that documents
the disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and
Community Engagement (471-6259 voice or 471- 4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of
hearing). Present the letter to the professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed
accommodations can be discussed. The student should remind the professor of any testing
accommodations no later than five business days before an exam. If you plan to make use of
specialized services through SSD please inform me before the second class meeting. For more
information, visit http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): If you are worried about someone who is acting

Assignment descriptions
1. Class participation (30%) - participation will be graded by evaluating your
participation in class, speaking, listening, and engaging with the course materials
and conversations with your colleagues.
2. Reading critiques (20%) - You will do 10 reading critiques which we will share
with each other. Each critique should be 2,500–3,500 characters in length. is is
approximately 400–500 words, or 1.5–2 double-spaced pages. Critiques should
take the form of commentary, questions, and synthesis from at least 2 of the
readings for that week. I encourage you to write about more than two readings,
you will not receive full credit if you only discuss one reading. You should scan all
the readings for each week and be prepared to discuss them at length, even if
you do not plan to turn in a critique that week. You are not allowed to turn in a
reading critique for credit the week you facilitate class discussion. Reading
critiques will be uploaded to the course’s Canvas website before the beginning of
class. Late reading critiques will not be accepted for credit.
3. Class facilitation (10%) - One week during the semester you will be responsible
for facilitating class. You can create a handout, a slidedeck, bring in an artifact, or
simply prepare notes to facilitate class discussion of each of the readings. You
will be responsible for covering the main themes and argument from each
reading and then encourage thoughtful engagement with the emergent topics or
the overall theme of that week. We will choose our preferred classes to facilitate
during Week 2.
4. Final term paper (40%) - You will write a final term paper which will be 40% of
your overall grade. The final paper must be turned into the Canvas website by 
the deadline negotiated by the class during week 1. Due to the emphasis on
reading and writing critiques, the final paper is relatively short. It should be 4-
5,000 words, inclusive of the title, notes, and references. The paper topic can be
on any technology or context related to the course. You will seek approval of the
topic from me by week 8 of the course. If you would like to write a final paper that
connects to outside research interests, including a master’s report, a master’s
thesis, a doctoral qualifying paper, or a publication, you must engage significantly
with the course texts and class discussions in a significant manner. Please use
APA reference style, include a full reference section. You should bring in outside
sources--primary, secondary, and scholarly sources, in addition to texts assigned
in the course. These outside references should not substitute substantial
engagement with the texts we have read.

Course Overview
Summary
This class will cover fundamental and state-of-art problems in computer vision, the subdiscipline of artificial intelligence that tries to create computers that can “see”. Students
will explore this field through examination of the human-based challenges faced when teaching computers to see. Classes will be a mix of lectures and hands-on training to develop
practical skills in web development and crowdsourcing.
Objectives
By the end of the course, the goals are for students to:
1. Recognize core and cutting edge computer vision concepts, a critical precursor to effective collaborations in industry or academia. Towards this aim, students will:
• Critique research papers that establish the datasets which define and promote
computer vision problems for investigation by the research community at large
2. Design crowdsourcing systems that can be harnessed to efficiently create high quality
“big” datasets. Towards this aim, students will:
• Evaluate crowdsourcing systems discussed in computer vision research papers
• Employ Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers via an application programming interface (api)
• Utilize command line tools
3. Create interactive web pages for generating computer vision datasets. Towards this
aim, students will:
• Architect web tools using HTML and CSS
1
• Develop programming skills by writing code in Javascript
4. Understand the key ideas in machine learning. Towards this aim, students will:

Policies
Academic Honor Code
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
“As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the
University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously. Therefore, if
you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in a previous class), cite
4
your sources. Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to
severe disciplinary penalties, such as automatically failing the course and potentially being
dismissed from the University. Please do not take the risk. Every student is responsible for
understanding the Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found
at the following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint student.php.
Please note that all assignments in this course may be processed by TurnItIn, a tool that
compares submitted material to an archived database of published work to check for potential plagiarism. Other methods may also be used to determine if a paper is the student’s
original work. These tools will assist in deciding if an assignment has been plagiarized.
Excused Absences
A student will be given an opportunity to complete any work missed due to absences
in observance of a religious holy day or military service. For a holy day, the student
must notify me at least two weeks in advance of the absence. Please see the following
link for more details: http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/academic-policies-andprocedures/attendance/. The student will not be penalized for excused absences, but must
complete the missed material within a reasonable time after the excused absence.
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before
the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas
law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution.
For more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop.
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we
all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or
exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to
meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. There are also a range of resources
on campus:
• Coping with Stress and Personal Hardships
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There
are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college
experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later
is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult
life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, please consider taking advantage of
the support available to you. http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html.
• Accommodations for Disability
Students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities are welcome in this class. If there
are circumstances that make the learning environment and activities difficult, if you
have medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific
arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am
committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only
5
do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain
the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact the Services for
Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone).
• The Sanger Learning Center
All students are welcome to take advantage of Sanger Center’s classes and workshops,
private learning specialist appointments, peer academic coaching, and tutoring for more
than 70 courses in 15 different subject areas. For more information, please visit
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/slc or call 512-471-3614 (JES A332).
• Writing Center
All students are encouraged to consult the University Writing Center (UWC):
http://uwc.utexas.edu.
Important Safety Information
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs, or Professors, call
BCAL (the Behavior Concerns Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous.
If something doesn’t feel right–it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence, and stalking at
federally funded educational institutions. UT-Austin is committed to fostering a learning
and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct
occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm
or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
“Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-onone. Before talking with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be
sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone
for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
https://titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.

Course Description
COURSE DESCRIPTION
Artificial intelligence is becoming an increasingly important fixture in our everyday lives. This course will help
you to understand the ethical challenges related to AI and how to address them. To do this, the course will
provide you with a broad range of ethical theories, including non-Western and feminist theories, and teach you
to apply these theories to contemporary ethical challenges resulting from AI.
LEARNING OUTCOMES
1. You will learn about the history of AI and the ethical challenges that arise from recent advances in AI
2. You will gain an awareness of a wide range of ethical theories and learn to apply them to the ethics of AI
3. You will learn about efforts to develop principles for the design of ethical AI and develop your own view
How Will You Learn?
STATEMENT OF LEARNING SUCCESS
The ethics of AI is a timely, important, and expansive topic that defies the boundaries of space and time.
Although ethics of AI was considered a fairly narrow, minor, and esoteric topic when I began pursuing research
on this topic over 20 years ago, today it is understood as a critical issue across academia, industry, government,
and nonprofits. As a result, demand for this course has expanded, leading me to offer this course as an online,
asynchronous course that can scale up to meet the increased demand. I hope that this course will provide a
launchpad for everyone to begin to explore the ethics of AI, and I will be happy to support your learning during
and beyond the semester in any ways that I can. I hope the flexibility of the videos and online discussions will
give you space and time to grapple with these important issues and help fit the course into your busy schedules.
TEACHING MODALITY INFORMATION
This course is fully asynchronous, and work can be done at any point during the week, although it is important
to note that topics are covered on a week-by-week basis, and there are multiple consistent deadlines during each
week. The deadlines are Wednesdays for discussion questions (which can be submitted before or after
completing the readings and watching the videos) and Mondays for quizzes, discussion answers, and take-aways.
During each week, you should first post your discussion question, then complete the readings, then watch the
videos (including completing the embedded quizzes), then post your answers, then post your take-aways. The
goal is to ensure that you are actively engaged in learning each week, as this engagement will assist you in
retaining this knowledge in the future. The quizzes and other elements of the course are intentionally designed
to be as straightforward as possible – the goal of the course is to assist and support you in your learning journey,
and to build a learning community that can facilitate everyone’s learning experience.
WEEKLY ACTIVITIES
WEEKLY SCHEDULE
COMMUNICATION
The course Canvas site can be found at utexas.instructure.com. Any time you have any questions or need to
provide any updates, please email both the instructor and the TA via Canvas. You are responsible for ensuring
that the primary email address you have recorded with the university is the one you will check regularly for
course communications because that is the email address that Canvas uses. Due to the asynchronous, online
nature of the course, it is critical that you regularly check Canvas and your Canvas-linked email account.

ASKING FOR HELP
Whenever you have any questions or need help, please email both the instructor and the TA via Canvas. Please
list your question or the topic in your email. Most simple inquiries can be figured out via email, so in those cases,
please provide enough information for us to be able to reach a prompt resolution. If your question is complex or
otherwise likely requires setting up a meeting, please list several available meeting times, to facilitate the process
of finding a mutually convenient time to meet. So, please do not just send generic emails asking for help or to
meet, please make sure to list the topic of your inquiry as well as enough detail to be able to reach a prompt
resolution of the inquiry (simple and straightforward questions or updates) or several available meeting times to
facilitate setting up a mutually convenient time (for more complex topics that require synchronous discussion).
DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION
I am deeply committed to doing everything that I can to ensure that all students, with a broad range of
intersectional identities and lived experiences, will be well served by this course, that the course will meet
students’ learning needs, and that the diversity that students bring to this class can be comfortably expressed
and viewed as a resource, strength and benefit to all students. Please reach out at any time with any concerns.
DISABILITY & ACCESS (D&A)
The university is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive learning environment consistent with
university policy and federal and state law. Please let me know if you experience any barriers to learning so I can
work with you to ensure you have equal opportunity to participate fully in this course. If you are a student with a
disability, or think you may have a disability, and need accommodations please contact Disability & Access
(D&A). Please refer to the D&A website for more information: http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. If you are
already registered with D&A, please deliver your Accommodation Letter to me as early as possible in the
semester so we can discuss your approved accommodations and needs in this course.
Course Requirements and Grading
REQUIRED MATERIALS AND DEVICES
All required materials are available via the course Canvas site. To be successful in this course, you will need a
device capable of accessing the course Canvas site, as well as reliable Internet access to use Canvas and email.
CLASS EXPECTATIONS
Class participation Since this is an online, asynchronous course, class participation for this course will
involve completing all weekly readings, watching all weekly videos and completing the embedded quizzes, and
participating in all weekly discussion boards (discussion questions and answers board and take-aways board).
Timely completion of all assignments is essential for you to stay on track and be successful in the class.
Professional standards You are individually responsible for completing all assignments on time and
independently – everyone will be graded on their own individual work. We are collectively responsible for
maintaining a respectful environment in the discussion boards at all times, and treating peers with respect.
Discrimination, personal attacks, or hate speech of any kind will not be tolerated, and will have consequences.
ASSIGNMENTS
The following table represents how you will demonstrate your learning and how we will assess the degree to
which you have done so.
Assignments Percent of Total Grade
Videos 25%
Quizzes 25%
Discussion Questions 10%
Discussion Answers 20%
Take-Aways 20%
Bonus Assignments Points Added to Total
Meet the Instructor (synchronous Zoom, multiple options) +1
Introductions (asynchronous video, multiple formats permitted) +1
Mid-Semester Check-In (synchronous Zoom, multiple options) +1
End-of-Semester Reflections (synchronous Zoom, multiple options) +1
Final Take-Aways (asynchronous video, multiple formats permitted) +1
ASSIGNMENT DEADLINES AND LATE WORK PENALTIES
The Canvas gradebook is set up to automatically deduct 10% of the total assignment grade per day, on top of any
deductions based on the assignment rubric. Please make sure to turn in all assignments on time. You are
responsible for your own time management and setting aside the time to complete class assignments – think of
the videos as a way to more flexibility adjust the learning that you would usually do during a set weekly threehour block to potentially multiple times throughout the week, and just as the readings and assignments for most
classes would be in addition to this class contact time, similarly these activities will be in addition to the videos.
Please manage your time accordingly, and make sure that you will be able to set aside enough time each week to
complete all of the required activities and assignments. You have some flexibility during the week, and you can
always choose to turn in assignments earlier during the week, but setting aside time during each week to devote
to completing the weekly class activities and assignments is essential. As such, We will not accept excuses such
as having a busy week or not getting around to the work in time – in those cases, the late penalty will stand as is.
For emergency situations, please work with Student Emergency Services so that they can notify us, allowing us
to extend deadlines as needed to accommodate the circumstances.
EXTRA CREDIT
As noted in the table above, there are opportunities to earn extra credit, as points added to your final grade.
VIDEOS (25%)
Videos are critical learning material for this course. You must watch at least 90% of each video to get credit for
watching that video. Please make sure to watch videos through Canvas.
QUIZZES (25%)
To ensure that you are completing, paying attention to, and understanding the readings and the videos, the
videos will include embedded quizzes. These quizzes will cover content from the readings and/or videos.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS (10%)
At the start of the week, post a discussion question about any aspect of any topic covered during the week.
Asking the question does not require prior preparation; your question does not need to demonstrate a full
comprehension of the week’s topic(s), just that you are intellectually curious to learn more about the topic(s).
DISCUSSION ANSWERS (20%)
Choose any two classmates’ questions and write one-paragraph answers to each. Please make sure to support
your answer with evidence from the readings and videos, citing at least two sources per answer (can be informal,

forewarn students about potentially disturbing content and I ask all students to help to create an atmosphere of
mutual respect and sensitivity.
BASIC NEEDS SECURITY
Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance
in the course is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. UT maintains the UT Outpost, which is a free
on-campus food pantry and career closet. Furthermore, if you are comfortable notifying me, please do so, so
that I can assist you in seeking assistance through campus resources.
SHARING OF COURSE MATERIALS IS PROHIBITED
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes,
exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets,
may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class without explicit, written permission of the instructor.
Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. The University is well aware of the sites used for sharing
materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of
materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students.
These reports can result in sanctions, including failure of the course.
RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence as far in advance as possible of the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in
order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence.
NAMES AND PRONOUNS
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with
differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender identity & expression, and nationalities.
Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless students have added a “chosen
name” with the registrar’s office, which you can do so here. I will gladly honor your request to address you by a
name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze,
etc.). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my
records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit this site. More resources available on the

• Individuals who hold a license to carry are eligible to carry a concealed handgun on campus, including in
most outdoor areas, buildings and spaces that are accessible to the public, and in classrooms.
• It is the responsibility of concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or about their
person at all times while on campus. Open carry is NOT permitted, meaning that a license holder may
not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on any university driveway, street,
sidewalk or walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area.
• Per my right, I prohibit carrying of handguns in my personal office. Note that this information will also
be conveyed to all students verbally during the first week of class. This written notice is intended to
reinforce the verbal notification, and is not a “legally effective” means of notification in its own right.
TITLE IX DISCLOSURE
Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Education Code, Section 51.252 (formerly known as Senate Bill 212) requires
all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, to report any information to theTitle IX Office regarding
sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas law requires that
all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing
assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations, or third party reports) must be report it. Before
talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, please remember that I
will be required to report this information to the Title IX Coordinator. If you would like to speak with someone
who can provide support or remedies without making an official report to the university, please email
supportandresources@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-
0419.
Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Education Code, Section 51.252,
they are still mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of
behaviors we refer to as sexual misconduct, including the types of sexual misconduct covered under Texas
Education Code, Section 51.252.The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and
compiled campus resources to support all impacted by a Title IX incident.

Course Description
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have changed the way decisions are made in
organizations, governments, and everyday life. This course will provide an introduction to
combining human and machine intelligence to benefit people and society. Students will learn
cutting-edge research on a number of topics related to human-AI interaction, including the
psychological and societal impacts of AI, AI biases and fairness, transparency and explainability,
human-in-the-loop decision-making/human-AI collaboration, robots and natural language based
AI, and design guidelines and methods for AI user experiences. These topics will be explored in
the context of real-world applications, including online social media and labor platforms,
algorithmic management tools for worker hiring and evaluation, and decision-support tools for
public administrative decisions on risk assessment and resource distribution. Students will form
interdisciplinary teams and learn through projects how to critically analyze existing AI systems,
study their human impact, and design new systems to be human-centered.
Note: This course is about human-centric theories and methods for envisioning AI systems. It
will provide no technical insight on machine learning, data-mining, or statistical pattern
recognition. Prior experience with social science research, programming, AI/machine learning,
human-computer interaction or interaction design, or user research will be helpful. This class is
interdisciplinary and you will be able to craft a project that best fits your background.
Learning Outcomes

Course Requirements and Grading
● Required Materials: All course readings will be available via the course Canvas site.
● Required Devices: You need access to computers to download the readings and
complete the assignments.
● Classroom expectations: Please make sure to be engaged and respectful, and to
contribute to discussions.
Assignments
1. Attendance & active participation. Students are expected to attend every class. Every
student should demonstrate ongoing engagement in class discussions. Absences will only be
excused in situations following university policy (illness, religious holy days, participation in
University activities at the request of university authorities, and compelling absences beyond
your control) with proper documentation and timely notification (prior to class for
non-emergencies).
2. In-class activities. Some weeks will involve in-class activities. n-class activities include
discussion activities prepared by reading panels as well as worksheet activities prepared by the
instructor and the TA. Once students complete the activities, the results will be reviewed by a
set of other students or shared with the entire class. The completion and review of the activities
will be completed during the class time.
3. Reading reflections. You will be assigned 2-3 readings per week. The readings are carefully
chosen to provide knowledge of both foundational work in the field and up-to-date, cutting edge
trends, methods, and studies. The weekly lectures will not cover the content of the readings, so
it is very important that you take the time to read these materials and reflect on them.
As you read the materials, note down your thoughts and questions. Discussion questions can
cover a range of topics, including useful take-aways and implications in terms of the methods
and findings of the paper, observations about trends in the field, doubts or concerns about the
findings and/or trends, next steps for researchers and practitioners, and how to apply
take-aways and implications in the real world.
Reading reflection question submission. Before 6 pm CT on Thursdays, you will submit three
discussion questions about the assigned readings via the provided website. You will then read
all the questions submitted by your classmates and vote for the questions that you’d like to
discuss in the class by 2 CT pm on Fridays. The reading panel teams will include the questions
with the most votes in the class discussion. The TA will keep track of questions that you submit
Spring 2022_Human-AI Interaction Syllabus
4
each week. Submitting three thoughtful discussion questions for all weeks will result in a full
score on the reading reflection assignment.
4. Reading quizzes. For the weeks with assigned readings, there will be brief, 5-10 minute
long, open-book quizzes that ask basic knowledge and take-aways from the required readings.
The quizzes will be easy. The quizzes are not meant to test your memorization ability; they are
designed to ensure that you understand and can quickly retrieve foundational concepts from the
readings. (Most questions will require verbatim answers taken from the readings.) The number
of questions and allotted times will vary depending on the week’s readings, but it will not exceed
10 minutes. The quiz will take place as the first activity of the class (e.g., 3:01 pm - 3:06 pm/3:11
pm CT). Late submissions, in other words, quizzes that are submitted after 3:06 pm/3:11 pm CT,
will not be considered, so please make sure that you join the class on time so that you can
submit the answers on time.
5. In-class reading panel activity. You will be part of the reading panel once in the semester.
The panel will consist of two to three students, and will lead an in-class reading discussion for
about one hour.
Presentation (10 minutes):
Reading summary (5 minutes): You will prepare 3-5 slides to summarize the papers. Please
note 2-3 key concepts, findings, and/or take-aways that you want to ensure that your
classmates remember.
Discussion and group activities (5 minutes): Then, you will pose three themes that cover all the
required readings for discussion and group activities. The panel should synthesize questions
raised by classmates and draw out three themes. In your presentation, for each of the three
themes, present the overarching theme and then list the questions submitted by your
classmates on which the theme is based. The top-voted reading reflection questions may
indicate topics that most students are interested in. Based on the themes, you will prepare
google slides or google docs that can structure each student group’s discussion and activities;
each group will use a google slide/doc to document their outcomes. The instructor will also
provide examples from the last semester for the panel’s inspiration and provide feedback on the
activities so please get in touch with the instructor early.
Prepare your own thoughts in response to these questions to set the stage for discussion.
Discussion (35 minutes): After the panelists’ presentation, we will randomly divide the class
into small groups (2-3 students in each) to discuss the topics following the panel’s instruction.
Each group (not individual students) should make a copy of the panel’s google slides/doc, and
use it to organize their discussion and write down their outcomes.
Discussion activity peer-review (10 minutes): After the discussion, each group’s discussion
outcome report will be randomly assigned to different students. Students will follow a rubric to
Spring 2022_Human-AI Interaction Syllabus
5
evaluate the outcome report. All students will also provide reviews of the panel’s discussion
activity guideline itself.
6. Term Project. You will work on a term project. Detailed guidelines are documented in the
Project Guidelines document.
7. Teamwork peer evaluation. We will conduct two teamwork peer evaluation surveys, one
during the midterm period and the other at the final. In the survey, you will be asked to evaluate
your teammates, including yourself, and your collaboration experiences. The survey results will
be factored into the overall teamwork peer evaluation grade.

6. Project 50%
7. Overall teamwork peer evaluation 5%
Late Work and Extensions
We will use a limited extension method on our assignment deadlines (i.e., reading reflections
and projects), which we call Extra hours. This is to provide you with some flexibility for the times
of heavy workload, minor illness, job interviews, conference travels, and other exceptional, yet
often predictable circumstances. You will have a total of 120 Extra hours for the entire semester,
and you may apply Extra hours to any reading reflection and project assignments. The Extra
hours will be deducted in one hour increments. This means that, if you upload your assignment
122 minutes late, it will use up 3 Extra hours. You can use at most 36 slack hours (1.5 days) for
a given assignment. Assignments more than 36 hours late will not be accepted. If a team
assignment is using Extra hours, every member’s hour will be deducted. Extra hours cannot be
applied to midterm and final presentations, and in-class reading panel activities.
Extra hours are not to support procrastination. Late submissions should only occur in
exceptional circumstances. If you use up your Extra hours and seek further extensions, you will
first need to provide acceptable justifications for all Extra hours that you used.
Spring 2022_Human-AI Interaction Syllabus

Absences
Absences will result in the reduction of the attendance and active participation grade. Absences
will only be excused in situations following university policy (illness, religious holy days,
participation in University activities at the request of university authorities, and compelling
absences beyond your control) with proper documentation and timely notification (prior to class
for non-emergencies).
Equitable Accommodation and Extra Credit
The semester-long project is a pivotal element of your learning experience. Each project will
involve a series of milestones that you will build off for the next milestone. If you improve your
submission based on our feedback, we will update the grade assigned to the milestone. We
encourage iteration, which is a foundation of any great work!
+/- Grading Policy and Grade Breaks
+/- grades will be used for the final class grade.
A 94-100% A- 90-93% B+ 87-89% B 84-86% B- 80-83% C+ 77-79% C 74-76%
For detailed information about what grade is required for you to receive credit for this class,
please refer to UT’s Graduate Catalog. For example, students in the School of Information are
required to receive a grade of B or higher in order to include this course in their program of work
toward graduation. In addition, the UT Graduate School requires a minimum grade of C or
higher to count a course for credit.
Course Outline
The detailed, up to date course outline is here and also posted on canvas. Changes to the
schedule may be made at my discretion if circumstances require. I will announce any such
changes in class and will also communicate them via a Canvas announcement and Slack. It is
your responsibility to note these changes when announced, and I will do my best to ensure that
you are notified of changes with as much advance notice as possible.

Carrying of Handguns on Campus
Texas’ Open Carry law expressly prohibits a licensed to carry (LTC) holder from carrying a
handgun openly on the campus of an institution of higher education such as UT Austin.
Students in this class should be aware of the following university policies:
● Students in this class who hold a license to carry are asked to review the university
policy regarding campus carry.
● Individuals who hold a license to carry are eligible to carry a concealed handgun on
campus, including in most outdoor areas, buildings and spaces that are accessible to the
public, and in classrooms.
● It is the responsibility of concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or
about their person at all times while on campus. Open carry is NOT permitted, meaning
that a license holder may not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus
premises or on any university driveway, street, sidewalk or walkway, parking lot, parking
garage, or other parking area.
● Per my right, I prohibit carrying handguns in my personal office. Note that this
information will also be conveyed to all students verbally during the first week of class.
This written notice is intended to reinforce the verbal notification, and is not a “legally
effective” means of notification in its own right.
Title IX Disclosure
Beginning January 1, 2020, TexasSenate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities,
including faculty, to report any information to theTitle IX Office regarding sexual harassment,
sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all
employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not limited to,
writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be report it. If you
Spring 2022_Human-AI Interaction Syllabus

would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making an
official report to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information
about reporting options and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX
Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-0419. Although graduate teaching
and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory
reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we
refer to as sexual misconduct, including the types of sexual misconduct covered under Texas
Senate Bill 212.The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and
compiled campus resources to support survivors.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
“Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the
Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX-related
incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me or with
any faculty or staff member about a Title IX-related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a
responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without
making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more

MATERIALS
Textbook. We willrely on portions of four books: Cooper
et al. (2014), Dodson (2006), Holtzblatt, Wendell, and Wood
(2005), and Rosenfeld, Morville, and Arango (2015). I am apparently allowed to put three chapters of any book on Canvas,
and I have done so with these books. In addition, some of them
are available for free at the library.
The study guide (on Canvas) is the only other required
textbook for the course.
3
Notebook. You should bring a paper notebook to class
every day and be prepared to upload pictures from it frequently.
The notebook should be the size of the Moleskine Cahier
notebook, 5 × 8.25 inches. It is widely available in packs of
three for about 15USD. Substitute any sketchbook of similar
size, e.g., Malvern Books has Leuchturm sketchbooks, which
have higher quality paper than Moleskine but are more expensive. Why do I insist on this size? You actually draw differently on larger notebooks due to the average shape and size
of the human hand.
You should only write or draw in the notebook and not
staple or paste scans or photos into it. All the work in the
notebook should be in pen or pencil, preferably pencil.
Phone or tablet with camera. You should bring a phone
ortablet orsome device with a camera to class and be prepared
to photograph your work to share it with the class.
Technology. Except for Figma, specific software packages will not be taught in this course. Students should use
judgment to select and use helpful software and should share
their experiences with different software packages during discussion. Different students have different software needs. It
makes sense to try a lot of different software packages to keep
you open-minded but to polish your skills with a few to help
you meet tight deadlines.

POLICY ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty
are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility
of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and
the integrity of the University, policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, please
visit the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct.
ACCOMMODATIONS
Any student with a documented disability (physical or cognitive) who requires academic accommodations should contact
the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office
of the Dean of Students at 471-6259 (voice) or 471-4641 (TTY
for users who are deaf or hard of hearing) as soon as possible
to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations.
RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. Sections 51.911 and 51.925 of the Texas Education Code address absences by students and instructors for
religious holy days. Section 51.911 states that a student shall
be excused from attending classes or other required activities,
including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy
day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized
for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination
or complete an assignment from which the student is excused
within a reasonable time after the absence.
7
University policy requires students to notify each of their
instructors as far in advance of the absence as possible so that
arrangements can be made.
INSTRUCTOR ABSENCE
Section 51.925 prohibits the university from discriminating
against or penalizing an instructor who is absent from class
for the observance of a religious holy day. Proper notice must
be given to the department chair. Prior to the begin of classes
each semester, the instructor must provide the department
chair a list of classes that will be missed due to observance of a
religious holy day. The list must be personally delivered, acknowledged and dated by the chair, or sent via certified mail,
return receipt requested.
Consistent with regular university policy, the instructor
is responsible for finding a qualified substitute UT Austin instructor for any missed class(es).
PERSONAL PRONOUNS
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important
with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences
of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender
identity & expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless
they have added a “chosen name” with the registrar’s office,
which you can do so here: https://utdirect.utexas.ed
u/apps/ais/chosen_name/. I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what
appears on the official roster, and by the pronouns you use
(she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early
in the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my
records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to

www.utgsc.org.
BASIC NEEDS SECURITY
Any student who faces challenges securing theirfood or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course
is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. UT
maintains the UT Outpost (https://deanofstudents.u
texas.edu/emergency/utoutpost.php) which is a free oncampus food pantry and career closet. Furthermore, please
notify the professor if you are comfortable in doing so. This
will enable him to provide any resources that he may possess.
MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATION
I urge students who are struggling for any reason and who
believe that it might impact their performance in the course
to reach out to me if they feel comfortable. This will allow
me to provide any resources or accommodations that I can. If
immediate mental health assistance is needed, call the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC) at 512-471-3515 or
you may also contact Bryce Moffett, LCSW (iSchool CARE
counselor) at 512-232-2983. Outside CMHC business hours
(8am-5pm, Monday-Friday), contact the CMHC 24/7 Crisis
Line at 512-471-2255.

This course uses a “Three Before Me” policy for student to faculty or teaching assistant
communications. When questions arise during the course of this class, please remember to check
three sources for an answer before emailing your instructor or TA:
1. Course Syllabus
2. Announcements in Canvas
3. The Discussion/Q & A Forum in Canvas
This policy will help you in potentially identifying answers before either Jake or I can get back to you,
and it also helps us from answering similar questions or concerns multiple times.
Although your classmates may be helpful in answering questions, please be aware that nothing in
the Canvas forum constitutes official course policy. In the event of a conflict between information
on the Q & A forum and information in the syllabus, always refer to the syllabus unless the
information in the syllabus was formally changed by the instructor through an official course 
2
announcement. Please note that your instructor will respond to your Q&A Forum posts and to your
emails within 24-48 hours on business days.
All instructor correspondence will be sent to your “@utexas.edu” e-mail account. Forwarded emails
to and from your UT to a personal account is not recommended because course related emails are
frequently “lost” in cyberspace. UT faculty will not respond to any e-mail address other than UT
account addressed emails.
NOTE: When emailing your instructor or TA, please include the course number “INF 385” in the subject
of your email, so we can prioritize it over other emails that are not course related.
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Mapping for the Common Good provides students of any background and any academic
specialty/interest a broad theoretical and technical understanding of maps, spatial data and
geovisualization. It is intentionally structured to highlight the many ways in which geographic
information technologies and spatial reasoning skills can profoundly impact our understanding of the
world. It also provides students with an opportunity to better appreciate how spatial data and
mapping can be used to develop strategies, plans, and designs to improve the quality of life for
communities and their citizens.
COURSE PREREQUISTE(S):
Graduate standing
LEARNING GOALS:
Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:
1. Explain how spatial analysis, mapping and geovisualization tools can be used to advance our
knowledge and understanding of human and environmental activities, as well as policy, from a
variety of disciplinary perspectives;
2. Recognize different types of maps and understand the structural and analytical issues that
underlie their creation;
3. Understand the breadth of modern mapping and geovisualization technologies and the social
ramifications of their use;
A core element of this course will include learning how to use a variety of mapping and visualization
platforms, including Google Earth and a commercial geographic information system (GIS), known as
ArcGIS Pro, from Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI).
REQUIRED BOOKS:
Smith, D., Strout, N., Harder, C., Moore, S., Ormsby, T. and T. Balstrom. (2018). Understanding
GIS, fourth edition: An ArcGIS® Pro Project Workbook. Esri Press, Redlands. ISBN:
9781589485266.

RECOMMENDED BOOKS:
Monmonier, M. (1996). How to Lie with Maps. University of Chicago Press: Chicago, IL.
ISBN: 0226534219
OTHER REQUIRED RESOURCES:
A functioning computer, up-to-date within the last 5 years. Please note, mobile devices such as tablets
or smartphones are not recommended for use with Canvas. The Canvas mobile app can be used for
occasionally checking on the course, but the mobile app will not display the course in its entirety. You
must access the course regularly from a full-featured laptop or desktop computer.
The following hardware and software packages will be available for use in the lab. Should you need
to work on labs/homework/projects outside of class you will need to have access to the following:
• ArcGIS Pro 2 (free, comes with required book, but 2.4 can also be downloaded from UT)
• Microsoft Windows
• Presentation software (PowerPoint, Keynote, or similar)
• Word processing software (Word, Pages, or similar)
• Web browsers (Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari)
• Adobe Acrobat Reader (free)
• Adobe Flash Player (free)
Running ArcGIS Pro outside of lab
This course requires that students install and use ArcGIS Pro 2 or 2.4 (ArcPro), an industry-standard
desktop GIS software suite produced by Esri. If you buy a new copy of the book you will get a 180-day
trial license with all the necessary extensions. If you do not buy a new book you will need to obtain a
copy of ArcGIS pro from UT if you plan on working off-campus.
UT students can obtain a stand-alone license for ArcGIS Pro 2.4 from UT
(https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/install-gis-software/arcgis-pro). ArcPro runs only on computers
with x86 and x64-compatible processors running Microsoft Windows. This means that some new
Windows 10 tablets cannot run ArcPro. Mac and Linux users will have to install Windows to run
ArcPro. If you are a Mac or Linux user, you have several options for installing and running Windows
and ArcPro: (1) dual-booting your computer (multi OS utility such as Boot Camp), which involves
carving out a separate partition on your hard drive for Windows and ArcPro, and (2) virtualization,
which involves using specialized software to simulate another computer system. Virtualization is far
easier, and should be used by anyone who is not already familiar with dual booting and disk
partitioning. Oracle's VirtualBox is a free and open source virtualization platform that can be used to
run Windows and ArcPro on Mac or Linux computers.
When working off campus you will need to download and install the Cisco Anyconnect VPN
(https://vpn.utexas.edu). You will need to be connected to the internet and have the Cisco VPN
running for ArcPro to function properly. 
4
NOTE: Please do not underestimate the time required to get a copy of ArcGIS Pro 2 or 2.4
operational on your personal machine. It is a headache, every year, for everybody. Get this going
ASAP.
LEARNING ACTIVITIES:
1. Exams (40%): There will be two exams in this class, each worth 20% of your final grade. Each
examination consists of multiple choice and short answer/essay/application questions. The
multiple-choice questions are designed to test your knowledge of lecture and text material. These
questions are often difficult and require careful reading on the exam. The short answer/essay
questions are designed to evaluate your comprehension of maps, map types, geovisualization and
their analytical foundations. Clarity of expression is a factor in assessing these questions. There
are no make-up exams.
2. ArcGIS Pro 2/2.4 Project: Locating a new park along the Los Angeles River (20%)
This is a ½ course-long project that will require a submission re: your activities each week.
Specifically, there will be a series of questions pertaining to the project each week that will require
your input. This may be the submission of a map, a small essay on the preliminary results, an essay
regarding data uncertainty or spatial representation, etc. This is an opportunity for you to express
yourself without strictly conforming to our project workbook. Take advantage of it. Each
submission is worth between 10 and 15 points. Grading will adhere to the rubric posted in
Canvas.
3. Mini Project (20%)
This is ½ course-long project that will require a final report (60 points) and presentation (30
points) to the class. Do not ask me what I want your project to be about. This is an opportunity
for you to select a topic that interests you. A one-page proposal of your paper is due on the 6th
week of class (10 points). The proposal should be written in sentence form (not an outline) and
should contain:
• A working title
• A brief description of what topic you plan to investigate
• A brief description of how you plan to go about investigating that topic
• A brief hypothesis of what you expect to find in your results (if appropriate)
• A bibliography of sources you have already found on this topic (5 minimum)
• A comprehensive description of where you are going to get data for analysis
The actual project report should adhere to the following guidelines:
• Typed, double-spaced, 1 inch margins on all sides, 12 or 11 point Times New Roman or
Arial fonts. You must also have a separate cover sheet that includes your name and
contact information (UT email).
• Your paper must be referenced (APA style); including complete and specific withinpaper citations of all books, articles, and Internet sites consulted (if I can’t look these
references up… don’t use them).
• You must include at least three publication quality maps generated in ArcGIS Pro.
5
4. Article Summaries (20%): Five journal articles will be assigned for the class to read during the
semester. The topics of these articles will relate to the subject matter of the lecture and/or class
for that particular week. Students are required to write a detailed summary of each article
(approx. 2-3 pages) discussing the subject matter and GIS/mapping techniques applied (with an
emphasis on the latter). Be critical!! Grading will adhere to the rubric posted in Canvas.
SUBMITTING ASSIGNMENTS AND LATE ASSIGNMENTS
All assignments are to be submitted by the due date. Late submissions will not be accepted unless:
1. an extension was granted by the instructor in advance of the due date;
2. documentation of an unforeseeable excused absence (as assessed in the instructor’s sole
discretion) is provided;
3. Your instructor and TA retain the right of refusal on assignments. In other words, if you are turning
in late work, we may not accept it.
Additionally:
4. All assignments, unless otherwise announced by the instructor, MUST be submitted via Canvas.
Each assignment will have a designated place to submit the assignment. Do not submit an
assignment via email.
5. Late submission of assignments is subject to penalty (see below). All assignments are due on
Mondays, at 11:59 pm Central Time. There are no exceptions. Schedule accordingly.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:
1. Academic Dishonesty – In addition to academic performance, students are expected to demonstrate
the qualities of honesty and integrity. All submissions by a student are expected to be the original
work product of the submitting student. Material that violates this requirement in any way, or that
constitutes any form of dishonesty, cheating, fabrication, the facilitation of academic dishonesty,
and/or plagiarism, may result in the student receiving a failing grade in the course (‘XE’) and in
appropriate disciplinary action being initiated. The possible sanctions include, but are not limited to,
grade penalties, permanent record on your transcript of academic dishonesty, loss of registration
privileges, disqualification, and dismissal. Please see the official UT Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism
(Policy Statement 08-02) for more details about the consequences of academic dishonesty. It is
accessible online at:
https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php
2. Electronic Review – To ensure compliance with academic integrity policies, written submissions will
be submitted to TurnItIn, or a similar plagiarism detection program. Submission of any writing
assignment in the course to the professor constitutes consent by the student for the instructor to
upload the paper to check against any anti-plagiarism database.
3. Citation Style – Students are required to use the citation style and format of either the American
Psychological Association (APA).
4. Avoiding Plagiarism – Some students truly do not understand what plagiarism is, and therefore
plagiarize unwittingly or unintentionally. But ignorance is not an excuse for unethical academic
conduct. To combat such ignorance, here are rules and resources to help you avoid any problems
with plagiarism. Of course, these rules apply regardless of the citation form or style you may be using.
a. Direct Quotations – Whenever you directly quote someone else, you must provide a citation
to the source of the material from which you are quoting. Moreover, you must put the
material in quotation marks or otherwise set it off in an indented quote so the reader knows
what words are yours and what words are quoted. It is unacceptable to use the words of 
7
others and only partially quote the original source. This is true even if you provide citation to
the source both in text and in your references section!
b. Paraphrasing/Indirect Quotations – Whenever you indirectly quote someone else (i.e., you
paraphrase the work of another), you must provide a citation to the source of the material
from which you are paraphrasing. Simply changing the structure of a sentence, or a few words
in a sentence so that the sentence you write is not an exact quote from the original source
does not mean a citation is not needed. This is because the idea you are expressing is not your
own, but rather someone else’s.
c. Using Other’s Ideas – Even if you compose an entire paragraph of writing in your own words
(i.e., neither quoted nor paraphrased), if the idea you are expressing in that paragraph is not
your own, original idea, you must provide a citation to the source from which you obtained
this idea.
d. Collaborative Work – If you collaborate on any work with someone else and fail to
acknowledge that collaboration, you are guilty of plagiarism. If you have received permission
from you professor to collaborate on some assignment, be sure that all the contributor's
names appear on the submission.
e. Altering or Revising Another’s Work – If you alter or revise the work done by someone and
submit that work as your own, you have plagiarized. Similarly, if you allow someone else to
alter or revise work that you have done and then allow that person to submit it as his or her
own work, you are both guilty of plagiarism. Work that is not entirely your own must be
credited by citation, both in text and in your references page.
f. Altering or Revising Your Own Prior Work – You should also be aware that altering or revising
your own work that was prepared for another class or another professor, and not bringing it
to the attention of the professor to whom you are submitting the revised work is also
academic dishonesty. If, for example, you have two classes that require a term paper, and
you can write one paper that meets the requirements of both classes, you may not submit
that paper to both professors unless you get permission to do so in advance from both
professors. Similarly, if you wrote a paper several semesters ago that can be revised and
submitted in satisfaction of a paper requirement for a course in which you are currently
enrolled, doing so is academic dishonesty unless you get the advanced permission of your
professor to do so. The reason this is dishonest is that it is not an original work prepared in
satisfaction for the requirements on the course you are currently taking.
IMPORTANT COURSE POLICIES
1. Required behavior standards are listed in the Student Code of Conduct and Student Disciplinary
Procedures, Campus IT Policies, and outlined by the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities.
Anyone in violation of these policies is subject to sanctions.
2. Students are entitled to receive instruction free from interference by other members of the class.
When a student’s behavior disrupts the educational process, the instructor may ask the student
to leave the classroom. 
8
3. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities accepts incident reports from students, faculty,
staff, or other persons who believe that a student or student organization may have violated the
Student Code of Conduct.
4. In accordance with Note Taking Services, written permission must be secured from the instructor
of the class in order to sell the instructor's oral communication in the form of notes. Notes must
have the notetaker's name as well as the instructor's name, the course number, and the date.
5. All lectures, exercises and assignment questions are the intellectual property of the instructor.
You are expected not to post completed assignments on the web, or to distribute these in any
form unless explicitly requested to do so by the instructor.
6. This class is a Wikipedia Free Zone. Under no circumstances are students to use Wikipedia,
Infoplease, About.com or other sites that are considered open “information commons” for
assigned work or term papers. Failure to observe this rule will result in a 10% penalty, FOR EACH
INSTANCE, on a given assignment.
7. Please notify the instructor or TA BEFORE an assignment is due if an urgent situation arises and
the assignment will not be submitted on time. Published assignment due dates (Central Time) are
firm. Please follow the appropriate University policies to request an accommodation for religious
practices or to accommodate a missed assignment due to University-sanctioned activities.
8. All assignments, unless otherwise announced, MUST be submitted to the designated area of
Canvas unless otherwise noted.
9. There is a limited timeline to drop or add the course. Consult with your advisor and notify your
instructor to add or drop this course. If you are considering a withdrawal, review the following UT
policies: Withdrawal from Classes, Medical/Compassionate Withdrawal, and a Grade of
Incomplete.
10. Grade disputes must first be addressed by discussing the situation with the instructor. If the
dispute is not resolved with the instructor, the student may appeal to the department chair per
the University Policy for Student Appeal Procedures on Grades.
SPECIAL LEARNING NEEDS:
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. To determine if you qualify, please contact the Dean of Students at
471-6259; 471-4641 TTY. If they certify your needs, we will work with you to make appropriate
arrangements.
DUE DATES, ABSENCES, AND EXCUSES:
Planned Excused Absences - It is important to complete your work on time, both so you can stay on track
and so you can collaborate and interact with your fellow students. Late assignments will not be accepted.
You will receive a zero if you do not submit your assignment on time. We use the Canvas upload time as
the official time of the submission, so if you submit your assignment 5 seconds after the deadline, Canvas
will mark your assignment late and you will receive a zero for that assignment. Not cool, but we have no
control over this.
Please make sure you submit your assignments well in advance; computer problems, network outages,
and other “technical” issues will not be considered a valid excuse for submitting an assignment late, so
make sure you submit your work early. Plan ahead. 
9
If you know that a future event will interfere with your ability to complete course work, you are
encouraged to contact the instructor or TA to make arrangements for completing the assignments.
Provided that a student informs the instructor of the reason for the absence at least one week in advance
of the absence, the instructor will attempt to make arrangements, only when absences are due to any of
the following three reasons:
a. religious reasons;
b. jury duty or similar governmental obligation (a copy of the summons or other official
paperwork must be provided); and
c. university-sanctioned and/or university-approved activities (e.g., artistic performances,
participation in research conferences, intercollegiate athletic activities, student government,
required class field trips, etc.).
MAKE-UP WORK:
If you are seriously ill or you are injured in a manner that prevents you from completing your work, you
should email and notify the instructor to let him know that you are sick or injured as soon as possible. The
same is true for the death, injury, or serious illness of an immediate family member. Please be advised
that for missed work based on an emergency situation to be excused, you may be required to submit
corroboratory documentation, such as a note from a physician documenting the illness or injury (notes
from family members will not suffice), a death certificate or other form of proof of a family member’s
death, etc.
STUDENT CONDUCT:
The University and I expect all students to comport themselves professionally. Toward that end, I
expect everyone to abide by the following rules of etiquette:
• Although you are welcome to disagree with the professor or your classmates, everyone is
expected to participate respectfully. Students who engage in personal attacks; who use rude,
insulting, or disrespectful language; or who engage in other disruptive or threatening
behavior may face disciplinary action.
• Please use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation in all course-related communications,
whether that is in the discussion boards, emails to the instructor, or assignments. “Text lingo”
and other invented spellings are not allowed.
• What To Call Me – I don’t care much for titles, so “Tony” is fine with me. If that freaks you
out, “Dr. G” or “Dr. Grubesic” works too.
SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT:
Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in,
be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both
Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited.
An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex 
10
can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you
know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources
at https://titleix.utexas.edu/campus-resources.
TECHNICAL SUPPORT:
For technical assistance 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, please contact the Information Technology Office
Help Desk:
Phone: 512-471-4357
Web: https://education.utexas.edu/about/college-offices/information-technology-office
SYLLABUS CHANGES:
I view this syllabus as an educational contract between me and the students in the course. Accordingly, I
will make every effort to avoid changing the course schedule, but the possibility exists that unforeseen
events will make syllabus changes necessary. I therefore reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus,
other than to the attendance and grading policies.
STUDENT SUCCESS
Students are expected to engage with the material in-class and outside of class. Furthermore, those who
do not read the assigned material carefully will do poorly. All assigned readings and lecture material are
examinable. If you are having problems with the course material or with the assignments, or if you just
seem to be getting behind, please see the course instructor as soon as possible.
To summarize:
• Check the course daily
• Read announcements
• Read and respond to course email messages as needed
• Complete assignments by the due dates specified
• Communicate regularly with your instructor and peers
• Create a study and/or assignment schedule to stay on track

Course Description
COURSE OVERVIEW:
Researchers and designers from computational fields are beginning to understand how the complexity of
systemic, structural, and historical circumstances affecting communities (e.g., poverty, illiteracy, and
geographical isolation) shape the design process. For example, participatory design (PD) and community-based
participatory research (CBPR) have been heavily used in HCI to design with underserved communities.
However, there is an opportunity for HCI researchers and practitioners in related fields to improve their use of
these methods to account for circumstances that may impact participants’ engagement (or lack thereof) in the
design process.
This seminar will examine methods used in empirical research studies that focus on designing or researching
computational technologies with or for people from underserved communities (e.g., empirical studies from ISrelated fields such as HCI and CSCW). We will analyze how principles of PD and CBPR are applied to these
studies. This course will provide you with a critical understanding of established or perhaps unestablished
research design methods, which support the creation and evaluation of ICT systems and services that would be
inclusive and beneficial to a broad range of users.
As a class, we will contribute a framework, or model for understanding how to use specific research methods
and when, and the strengths and weaknesses of each method. The research methods investigated will not be
fully comprehensive—these methods will be derived from a survey of related research provided by the
instructor and also based on students’ current research and research interests.
Those of you who have formulated a few focused research questions, intend to engage with populations who
may be marginalized or understudied in your area of focus, and have considered the use of methods described 
2
above are encouraged to enroll and would most benefit. An ideal outcome from this class is a well-formed
proposal that you can execute over the summer and/or submit to an agency for funding. A key course goal is to
create opportunities for you to refine your method/approach. Feel free to use this class as an opportunity to pilot
new methods and discuss their outcomes. Ultimately, I’d like for you to walk away with an opportunity to
publish your findings to your venue of choice.
Learning Goals and Objectives:
On successful completion of the course, the student will be able to meet the following learning objectives:
1.To critically evaluate the concepts and principles that underlie research methodologies designed with
special populations and situations in mind (e.g., Action Research, Participatory Design and CommunityBased Participatory Research)
a.To define AR, PD and CBPR.
b.To identify and explain the key components of and differences between AR, PD and core
principles of CBPR
c.To describe the strengths and weaknesses of PD and CBPR.
d.To critically evaluate the underlying PD and CBPR concepts to evaluate user experiences.
2.To explain the rationale for the use of PD and CBPR to address problems with computational
solutions.
3. To compare and contrast the differences between traditional research methods and methods that are
designed to be more inclusive.
4.To discuss differences among specialized groups that could impact the use of certain methods
(particularly from PD).
a.To make informed decisions about which technique(s) to use for certain populations and why.
5.To contribute to a model or framework that includes a curated collection of methods for creating and
evaluating more inclusive ICTs.
Preferred Skills:
There are no formal prerequisites for this course. This course is not designed to be an introductory methods
course. Ideally, students will have some familiarity with contextual inquiry, qualitative interviewing skills,
needs assessment, and some survey design.
How to succeed in this course:
1. Please make sure to complete all readings prior to class and all assignments by their due dates and
times.
2. Please make sure to come into the class with an open mind, and to develop your own perspectives.
3. Please make sure to be respectful during all class discussions, and to appreciate others’ perspectives.
Course Requirements
Required Materials
All course readings will be made available via the course Canvas site.
3
Required Devices
There are no required devices, but please bring the readings for the week, in print or electronically.
Classroom expectations
Please make sure to be engaged and respectful at all times and to contribute to class discussions.
Optional Textbook:
I will draw insights from the books: Methods in Community-Based Participatory Research for Health by
Barbara Israel et al.; Design for Inclusivity by John Clarkson, Julia Cassim, and Roger Coleman, and
Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples by Linda Tuhiwai Smith.
Course Readings:
Course readings will be available via University of Austin’s Canvas (or the World Wide Web).
There will be additional assigned readings drawn from a range of sources including your own. These readings
and other resources will be available via Canvas. Weekly readings will be located in subfolders labeled by
week number.
Assignment Submission:
For all writing assignments, please use a digital format that permits inline comments. Microsoft Word and/or
Google Docs are fine. You will upload all assignments to Canvas.
All assignments should be turned in by 8 pm. each Monday before class, on Canvas. Name the file with
your surname and the name of the assignment. For example, smith_summary.doc. For group assignments, if
applicable, please use surname(s) in alphabetical order, followed by the name of the assignment. For example,
smith_turner_summary.doc.
Assignments that are submitted late will lose 2/3 of a letter grade on the first day that an assignment is late.
After that, 1/3 of a letter grade will be deducted for each day the assignment is late, up to two whole letter
grades. Students may request an extension but they must contact me 24 hours in advance and give a valid
reason why they are late.
Assignments
1. Assignment 1: Attendance and Participation
a) Because the vast majority of the learning in this class will occur within the classroom, you are
required to attend class regularly. Attendance will be taken during each class period. Absences
will only be excused in situations following university policy (illness, religious holy days,
participation in University activities at the request of university authorities, and compelling
absences beyond your control) with proper documentation and timely notification (prior to class
for non-emergencies). Excessive tardiness may be considered as an unexcused absence except in
situations following university policy.
b) Class participation is a critical element of this course. The effectiveness of the course will be
significantly impacted by the quality of your participation. Class participation is not merely
attendance, but rather factors in your overall contributions to the collaborative learning
environment, based on both the quantity and quality of your interactions in all aspects of the
course. Discussion of class participation with the instructor is encouraged in order to ensure that
you are making the most of the classroom experience and the accompanying opportunities for 
4
learning. You are expected to participate in all aspects of class discussion. You should come to
class prepared to discuss the required readings, as well as your perspectives on these readings.
You should strive for balance in your contributions, and your participation will not be based on
who speaks the loudest or the longest, but on consistent participation of significant quantity and,
most importantly, quality.
c) Your attendance and class participation grade will be calculated by multiplying the numerical
assessment of your class participation by the percentage of classes that you attend (with
exceptions made for documented, university-recognized absences as noted above). Please note
that regular attendance and active participation in each class session are critical for receiving a
good grade in this course. For example, by actively participating in each class, you will receive a
full letter grade higher than if you were to skip half of the classes or to be half-awake for all of
the classes.
2. Assignment 2: Article Synthesis
Students will prepare two 1-2-page (500-1000 words) synthesis twice in the semester of at least three
articles, ideally related to your area of interest, that you select on your own. If you’re unable to determine a
topic or articles, feel free to reach out to me. By the end of the semester, the class will have a collection of
synthesized articles as well as a spreadsheet capturing key factors about the paper (e.g., title, author,
abstract, population targeted, the study goal and research questions asked, research methods used, group
dynamics encountered, and outcomes).
3. Assignment 3: Article Presentation
Due to the number of students currently registered for the class, we will need to be flexible in our
schedule. With 15 students, you will likely only be able to discuss one set of synthesized articles and you
will likely need to do so in groups (2 or 3) starting on 9/06/2021 (Week 2). You will present your synthesis
and lead a discussion/activity of this work. You will have at least 35-40 minutes to present and time for
reflection/discussion/in-class activity. The following is a suggested flow for PowerPoint slides, though feel
free to improvise. You can also opt to use this time to pilot or propose a new method given the results of
their synthesis or new study design altogether:
1. Article Title, author(s), year of publication
2. Abstract, population targeted, goal of study and research questions asked, research methods used,
group dynamics encountered, and outcomes).
3. Literature background (note key points and citations),
4. Population targeted (unique traits or characteristics about the population; pluralisms)
5. Research question(s), major hypotheses (presentation should note underlying arguments)
6. Target technology or application being developed or evaluated
7. Key aspects of the research design (research design, sample size, data collection, location of study)
8. Key aspects of the research methods (what methods were used and why?)
9. Your evaluation of the strengths and potential weaknesses of the methods used and why? Students
will increase their knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses based on summaries and student
presentations.
10. Major Findings
11. Discussion points
a. Aspects of trust, power, culture and cultural competence, recognition of communities’
assets (Johannah and Swartz, 2019)
b. How did the community benefit from this research? How was this assessed? (If not, how do 
5
you propose assessing potential benefits?)
12. Your personal thoughts/reflections (are the results believable, were the methods valid, what are
alternative approaches to the methods used, how would you extend/redo this work, etc.)
Each week’s presenters will upload their synthesis and slides before class (Monday 11:59pm) to Canvas
for other students to preview and prepare questions.
4. Assignment 4: Research Paper
You will be expected to write a draft outline of a final paper (1,500 – 5,000 words) and final
paper (5,000 – 7,500 words) for this course, which is high enough quality to submit to a
conference or journal in your field. I encourage you to use your journal or conference’s article template
throughout the course and treat it as a working paper or work in progress that you plan to submit at the end
of the course.
If you are a junior Ph.D. student or a master’s student and do not have access to existing data or results for
your final paper, you can write an extended literature review (based on prior summaries) that can be used
to motivate a future study.
a) Paper Proposal: Your paper proposal must include the proposed title of your research paper as well
as a one-page description of the goals of your research paper. Research paper proposals will be
graded according to the following criteria: suitability of the topic, creativity of the topic, and
appropriateness of the research goals.
b) Paper Outline: Your paper outline will typically include bulleted lists, filling in as much detail as
you have ready at this point, and incorporating feedback from the paper proposal. Citations must
follow APA Style (there are many useful online resources available; I recommend:
https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/). Research paper outlines will be graded
according to the following criteria: clarity of the plan for the paper; appropriateness of the plan for
the paper; and appropriateness of the references.
c) Final Paper: Your final paper must incorporate feedback from all previous stages of the paper
development. Your paper must be complete, coherent, and easy to read. Please make sure to
proofread your paper thoroughly prior to submission. The final paper should be 5,000-7,500 words.
All citations must follow APA Style.
d) Final Presentation: During one of the three final weeks of the semester, you will present your
research paper to the class in the form of an audiovisual presentation. The presentation week and
length will be announced well in advance of the date. You may give your presentation using a
visual aid such as PowerPoint, Prezi, or Keynote; create and demonstrate a website or other
technology; or create a video. Research paper presentations will be graded according to the
following criteria: quality of research, quality of visual presentation, and quality of oral
presentation.
Grading for this Course
The following table represents how you will demonstrate your learning and how we will assess the degree to
which you have done so.

Grade reconsideration:
While I do my best to grade each student fairly, if you believe the grade you received on an assignment is
inappropriate, you may ask to have your grade reconsidered. To do so, explain to me in an email why you feel
your work deserves re-grading. You should provide details and point to specifics in the assignment that you
feel merit a higher grade. Requesting grade reconsideration does not ensure that your grade will change, but
your arguments will be carefully considered. Note: one of three outcomes is possible: your grade may be
raised, it may remain the same, or it may be lowered.
Course Outline
All instructions, assignments, readings, rubrics and essential information will be on the Canvas website at

Policies
Classroom Statements and Policies
Land Acknowledgment
I would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on the Indigenous lands of Turtle Island, the ancestral name
for what is now called North America. Moreover, I would like to acknowledge the Alabama-Coushatta,
Caddo, Carrizo &/Comecrudo, Coahuiltecan, Comanche, Kickapoo, Lipan Apache, Tonkawa and Ysleta Del
Sur Pueblo, and all the American Indian and Indigenous Peoples and communities who have been or have
become a part of these lands and territories in Texas.
Statement on Learning Success
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need to be adaptable because we all learn differently.
If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as
possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also
encourage you to reach out to the student resources available through UT. Many are listed on this syllabus, but
I am happy to connect you with a person or Center if you would like.
Statement on Flexibility
In acknowledgement of COVID-19 and its impact on the University of Texas at Austin community, this
course will reaffirm one of the core values here at UT Austin: responsibility. Our responsibility to ourselves
and each other is to put our humanity in the forefront of our academic pursuits. With that being said, this
semester I commit to being adaptable in this time of great need, which is reflected in the course policies below
around attendance, grading, and assignments/exams.
If you experience any hardships such as illness, accident, family crisis please know that these policies may be
amended and therefore you should communicate with me as soon as you feel comfortable doing so. If for any
reason you do not feel comfortable discussing with me, please visit Student Emergency Services. For
additional campus resources, please visit protect.utexas.edu.
Personal Pronouns
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing
with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and
nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they have added a
“preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center, which you can do so here:
http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-resources/. I will gladly honor your request to
address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the gender pronouns
you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make
appropriate updates to my records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit
https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns.

Absences
Being present is critical to achieving our goals for this course.
Excused Absence: Absences will be considered excused if they are for religious holidays or extenuating
circumstances due to medical or family emergencies. If you plan to miss class due to observance of a
religious holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will not be penalized for this
absence, although you will still be responsible for any work you will miss on that day if applicable.
Check with us for details or arrangements.
If you have to be absent, use your resources wisely. Ask your team and other classmates to get a rundown and notes on any lessons you miss. If you find there are topics that we covered while you were
gone that raise questions, you may come by during office hours or schedule a meeting to discuss. Email
specific questions you have in advance so that we can make the most of our time. “What did I miss?” is
not specific enough.
Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments
(quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and
additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my
explicit, written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the
University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well aware of the sites used for
sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected
unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the
Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course.
Class Recordings
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected
under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this
restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.
University Resources and Supports for Students

• Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that
the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
• Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of
class.
• In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a
building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at
Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment,
sexual assault, unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, dating/domestic violence and
stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and
working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When unprofessional or inappropriate
conduct of a sexual nature occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become
involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities, including
faculty, report any information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating
violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive
any information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-onone conversations) must be reported. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related
incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty
or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If
you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making an official report
to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and
resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu,
or call 512-471-0419.
Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still
mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer
to as unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, including the types of conduct covered under
Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and
compiled campus resources to support survivors.

Course Description
In this course we will examine several influential books that address the interplay of media
systems, technologies and society. The material we’ll read during the term has been selected
because it raises issues concerning the ways in which media systems old and new have
defining powers that go beyond the superficial notion of how they operate or which
“audiences” they attract. Our simplest goals will be to understand alternative ways of
thinking about and researching technology. We will pay careful attention to authors'
conceptions of how technology figures in various aspects of society, including its supposed
“impacts” on society, its role in creating and shaping broad information and cultural systems
and the attendant political and economic reverberations. Theories of society are
foregrounded in some of the readings, and occupy central positions in other work even
though they may be more implicit than explicit. Issues of class, race, ethnicity and gender
are woven into many of these works and will figure into our discussions as well. We are
reading primarily complete books in order to work with ideas and arguments that are fully
worked out by their authors.
Our point of departure is that one cannot meaningfully discuss media systems without
acknowledging the social context in which they reside, originate, function and evolve.
Culture and cultural issues are defined and explored broadly as encompassing the common
practices and rituals of everyday life as well as the long-standing patterns and values that
characterize society. The ways in which media systems or technologies are synonymous
with modernity, post-modernity or perhaps the Anthropocene will be addressed in many of
our readings. Some of the theoretical and methodological approaches we will explore
include social construction of technology, technological determinism, actor-network theory
and the political economy of communication.
The course objectives include:
• Cultivating familiarity with methodological approaches such as historical, qualitative and
ethnographic research in researching communication technology issues or problems;
• Exploring some of the dominant theories and frames associated with studying
communication technologies;
• Developing a critical voice with respect to communication technology studies;
• Developing a publishable, original paper on a communication technology topic.
2
Readings
Readings will include the following books:
Raymond Williams, Television: Technology and Cultural Form, Hanover: Wesleyan
University Press, 1974; Susan Douglas, Inventing American Broadcasting, Baltimore: Johns
Hopkins University Press, 1987; Gabriella Coleman’s Coding Freedom, Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 2013; Tarleton Gillespie’s Custodians of the Internet, Yale
University Press, 2018; Virginia Eubanks, Automating Inequality, New York: St. Martins
Press, 2017; Alissa Richardson's Bearing Witness While Black, New York: Oxford
University press, 2020; Lee Humphries, The Qualified Self, Cambridge: MIT Press, 2018.
Some articles available through electronic reserves will round out our readings.
I also recommend and may refer to other well-known books that have influenced how
researchers talk about and research technology systems. Among them are: Leo Marx, The
Machine in the garden: Technology and the pastoral ideal in America, Oxford University
Press, 1964; Vincent Mosco, To the Cloud: Big Data in a Turbulent World (2014); Bruno
Latour, Reassembling the Social: an introduction to actor-network theory, 2007, Oxford:
Oxford University Press; Safiya Noble, Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines
Reinforce Racism (2018); Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities, London: Verso,
1983; Carolyn Marvin, When Old Technologies Were New; Langdon Winner, The Whale
and the reactor, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986; Shoshana Zuboff, In the Age
of the Smart Machine, New York: Basic, 1984; Signal Traffic, edited by Lisa Parks and
Nicole Starosielski (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2015); and Ithiel de Sola Pool’s
classic Technologies of Freedom.
You will find that several of the books we examine focus on particular media systems or
technologies, and that their overall approach debunks the idea that communication
technologies are independent, “exogenous variables” in equations of outcomes or
influences. One of our goals in the course will be to carefully investigate how media
systems and their effects are presented to the public at large and to the community of
scholars. Theories of political economy and theories of economic and social development
are fundamental to our work, as are conceptions of how what passes for progress (and the
panoply of terms describing the hops, jumps, failures, and straddling that bind and explain
innovation, science, technologies and cultural trajectories) becomes labeled as such.
Please note that some ancillary materials will be housed on the electronic reserves site
associated with this class.
Grading
Students are expected to attend class having read the assigned material. Please be prepared 
3
to discuss the material and to raise questions and issues. The course will be conducted as a
seminar, and students will be responsible for certain questions or commentary on the
readings.
I will ask you to write commentaries on our readings that will be posted in our online forum
(Canvas), and these commentaries will be a point of departure for discussion purposes. Your
commentaries could develop some point or question that you believe is important, and you
should feel free to link your comments to other work that you have read. I do not expect you
to do outside research in the commentaries; rather, they are a way for you to reflect on the
readings of the week and to integrate them with other work and ideas you might have
encountered in your graduate career. I expect you to spend no more than about an hour on
each comment. While I will not give letter grades on the commentaries, I will read and
sometimes respond to them (and record them as ""inventive and reflective"" or ""did the
reading"" or “no credit”). They often become points of departure for in-class discussion.
You will be expected to take an active role in planning for seminar conversations. Each
class member will work in a two-person team in order to compose a discussion prompt (just
one or two, please) for each class meeting. Please do work together on the prompt rather
than submitting separate questions/thoughts. That team also will initiate discussion on their
prompt, working from their own online responses. It is fine to write about something else if
you like; the prompt is there to jumpstart your thinking.
Prompts should be posted by the Sunday before the Thursday class; responses should be
posted by the Wednesday 6:00 pm before each Thursday class.
A final term paper will allow you to explore one theme in depth. It is due on the final Friday
of classes, but you should be prepared to discuss its broad outlines during our final class
sessions. I would like you to submit a draft of the paper on November 11 so that I can
provide some guidance before you complete it.
The written work for this course often has resulted in papers that can be presented at
professional conferences and ultimately submitted for publication, and I urge you to strive
for a high level of originality, professional writing, and careful research in your final paper.
The paper should address some aspect of technology development in the context of the
broader social environment, and I anticipate that one of the theoretical approaches we
dissect will be developed in your work. It should include formal citations, preferably in
APA style, and represent thorough conceptual development.
Grades will be assigned on the following basis:
Course participation: 15%
Final research paper: 45%
Commentaries: 40%

A note on scholastic honesty
The General Information catalog of the University defines scholastic dishonesty on pages
171-172. Its definition includes but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, collusion,
falsifying scholastic records, and any act designed to give unfair advantage to the student, or
the attempt to commit such an act. Each such act is further defined in the General
Information section. Of particular relevance to graduate classes is the prohibition on
falsifying research data, laboratory reports, and/or other academic work offered for
credit and plagiarism, which is defined the appropriation, buying, receiving as a gift, or
obtaining by any means another's work and the submission of it as one's own academic
work offered for credit. As the section in the catalog points out, you can avoid plagiarism
by clearly citing other peoples’ work when you use it in your own written papers. Copying
from published and unpublished (e.g., web works) can constitute plagiarism. Any incidence
of scholastic dishonesty in this course will result in a failing grade for the class. The
University’s Honor Code is found at
https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php . Please let me know if
you have any questions about how to use other people’s work in your own efforts.
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement
Students may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity
and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259 and
http://www.utexas.edu/disability/ .
Attending class and religious holidays
By UT Austin policy, you should notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days
prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an
examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day,
you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after
the absence.
Mental Health Resources
The Counseling and Mental Health Center, University Health Services and the
Employee Assistance Program are confidential as outlined by federal and state law. UT
also offers private resources who are not confidential but are non-mandatory reporters to
Title IX and the university. Advocates, University Ombuds, Faculty Ombuds, and the
Interpersonal Violence Peer Support Program are all private resources, and safe spaces
to ask questions and receive support without making an official report to the university.
These services are there for you if you would like emotional support, would like to discuss
options, or are in need of academic or financial assistance.
Important Safety Information
8
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors, call
BCAL (the Behavior Concerns Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous.
If something doesn’t feel right – it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your
concerns.
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at
federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and
working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct
occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or
have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
“Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX
to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX
related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with
me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask
whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or
remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources,
visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
COVID Policies
To help preserve our in person learning environment, the university recommends the
following.
 Adhere to university mask guidance.
 Vaccinations are widely available, free and not billed to health insurance. The
vaccine will help protect against the transmission of the virus to others and reduce
serious symptoms in those who are vaccinated.

Course Overview:
This course will provide an overview of how information, information security, and privacy, relate to public policy at the state, federal and international level. Examines key information policy areas including protection of confidential information, privacy, surveillance, theft, health information, business-to-business relationships, and the co-evolution of personal data and information technologies. While this course has required, recommended, and optional reading, much of the course content will be covered during lectures with a number of guest speakers from a variety of backgrounds including public policy formulation, lobbyist, privacy, information security, and cybersecurity.
Course Learning Goals: 
❖	Upon course completion, students will have:
o	An understanding about how Information-related public policy in the U.S. is developed at the state and federal level and how to effectively analyze public policy.
o	Knowledge of how businesses engage governmental affairs and lobbyists to champion their respective points of view on information security and privacy with legislators.
o	Knowledge of current information privacy regulatory frameworks both in the US and abroad.
o	An understanding of various types of confidential information and the public policies that impact how individuals and organizations gain access to, store, and destroy confidential information.
❖	In addition, students will have an improved ability to influence the public policy related to information in their roles as security and privacy professionals as well as private citizens.
Beyond this Course: 
❖	This course is designed to provide students with a strong foundation on how public policy impacts information related to digital identity, information security, and privacy. Given the rapidly changing technological, political, and regulatory landscape, students will be able to analyze policies to understand impact on business and personal as well as understand how to advocate for changes to policies.

Attendance Requirements
Given the importance of both classroom discussions related to the reading materials and guest lectures, it is critical that students attend all classes. If it is necessary to miss class, the instructor must be informed 48 hours prior to the scheduled class in order to determine if an accommodation will be granted. Unexcused absences will result in a 3-point deduction per academic day missed. Students that do miss class are expected to schedule time with the instructor during office hours.
Flexibility
Each student will be able to drop the lowest grade in each of the following categories: monthly class summations and comprehension essays. This will give flexibility when something unexpected happens not covered by these policies and allow you to strategically use grade drops to balance your course workload and other commitments. Please let me know if you face difficulties this semester in accessing course resources or completing work. 
Late Submissions:  The expectation is that you will submit your work on time. If you must make a late submission, in order to receive partial credit you will need to submit the deliverable within 72 hours of the original due date. NOTE: a 25% deduction will be applied to the grade when a deliverable is submitted late but within 72hrs of due date. After 72 hour no credit will be received for the assignment.

University of Texas and  MSISP grading policies
 
Grading
Students must receive a grade of C or higher in each course to receive credit towards their degree. If a student earns anything less than a C, they will have to retake the course when it is offered again.  Candidates for the master’s degree must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00 in core courses. Per University policy, any graduate student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.00 at the end of any semester will be placed on scholastic warning status, and must bring his or her cumulative GPA to at least 3.00 during the next semester, or be subject to dismissal from the program.
 
Official grade point averages are calculated by the registrar and appear on the student’s academic record maintained by the registrar.

Learn to detect and defuse it. The course will be offered as a 1-credit seminar this spring through the Information School at the University of Washington. We aim to expand it to a 3 or 4 credit course for 2017-2018. For those who cannot attend in person, we plan to videotape the lectures this spring and make them them freely available on the web. 

Our learning objectives are straightforward. After taking the course, you should be able to:

Remain vigilant for bullshit contaminating your information diet.
Recognize said bullshit whenever and wherever you encounter it.
Figure out for yourself precisely why a particular bit of bullshit is bullshit.
Provide a statistician or fellow scientist with a technical explanation of why a claim is bullshit.
Provide your crystals-and-homeopathy aunt or casually racist uncle with an accessible and persuasive explanation of why a claim is bullshit.
We will be astonished if these skills do not turn out to be among the most useful and most broadly applicable of those that you acquire during the course of your college education.            Each of the week-long modules will explore one specific facet of bullshit. For each week, a set of required readings are assigned. Supplementary readings are also provided for those who wish to delve deeper.

Week 8. Publication bias. Even a community of competent scientists all acting in good faith can generate a misleading scholarly record when — as is the case in the current publishing environment — journals prefer to publish positive results over negative ones. In a provocative and hugely influential 2005 paper, epidemiologist John Ioannides went so far as to argue that this publication bias has created a situation in which most published scientific results are probably false. As a result, it’s not clear that one can safely rely on the results of some random study reported in the scientific literature, let alone on Buzzfeed. Once corporate funders with private agendas become involved, matters become all the more complicated.

Week 11. Fake news.. Fifteen years ago, nascent social media platforms offered the promise of a more democratic press through decentralized broadcasting and a decoupling of publishing from advertising revenue. Instead, we get sectarian echo chambers and, lately, a serious assault on the very notion of fact. Not only did fake news play a substantive role in the November 2016 US elections, but recently a fake news story actually provoked nuclear threats issued by twitter.

",,"Our world is saturated with bullshit. Learn to detect and defuse it. The course will be offered as a 1-credit seminar this spring through the Information School at the University of Washington. We aim to expand it to a 3 or 4 credit course for 2017-2018. For those who cannot attend in person, we plan to videotape the lectures this spring and make them them freely available on the web. 

Our learning objectives are straightforward. After taking the course, you should be able to:

Remain vigilant for bullshit contaminating your information diet.
Recognize said bullshit whenever and wherever you encounter it.
Figure out for yourself precisely why a particular bit of bullshit is bullshit.
Provide a statistician or fellow scientist with a technical explanation of why a claim is bullshit.
Provide your crystals-and-homeopathy aunt or casually racist uncle with an accessible and persuasive explanation of why a claim is bullshit.
We will be astonished if these skills do not turn out to be among the most useful and most broadly applicable of those that you acquire during the course of your college education.            Each of the week-long modules will explore one specific facet of bullshit. For each week, a set of required readings are assigned. Supplementary readings are also provided for those who wish to delve deeper.

Overview and learning objectives
The format of the class will be a mix of lecture, discussion, in-class activities, and qualitative and quantitative research assignments. Students will work in small groups for in-class activities, and work independently on all class project deliverables and homework assignments. Instructors will provide guidance in completing the exercises each week.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

Analyze large and complex data effectively and ethically with an understanding of human, societal, and socio-technical contexts.
Take into account the ethical, social, and legal considerations when designing algorithms and performing large-scale data analysis.
Combine quantitative and qualitative research methods to generate critical insights into human behavior.
Discuss and evaluate ethical, social and legal trade-offs of different data analysis, testing, curation, and sharing methods.

Policies
The following general policies apply to this course.

Respect
Students are expected to treat each other, and the instructors, with respect. Students are prohibited from engaging in any kind of harassment or derogatory behavior, which includes offensive verbal comments or imagery related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion. In addition, students should not engage in any form of inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention, and should respect each others’ right to privacy in regards to their personal life. In the event that you feel you (or another student) have been subject to a violation of this policy, please reach out to the instructors in whichever form you prefer.

The instructors are committed to providing a safe and healthy learning environment for students. As part of this, students are asked not to wear any clothing, jewelry, or any related medium for symbolic expression which depicts an indigenous person or cultural expression re­appropriated as a mascot, logo, or caricature. These include, but are not limited to, iconography associated with the following sports teams:

Chicago Blackhawks
Washington Redskins
Cleveland Indians
Atlanta Braves
Attendance and participation
Students are expected to attend class regularly. If you run into a conflict that requires you to be absent (for example, medical issues) feel free to reach out to the instructors. We will do our best to ensure that you don’t miss out, and treat your information as confidential.

If you miss class session, please do not ask the professor or TA what you missed during class; check the website or ask a classmate (best bet: use Slack). Graded in-class activities cannot be made up if you miss a class session.

Grading
Active participation in class activities is one of the requirements of the course. You are expected to engage in group activities, class discussions, interactions with your peers, and constructive critiques as part of the course work. This will help you hone your communication and other professional skills. Correspondingly, working in groups or on teams is an essential part of all data science disciplines. As part of this course, you will be asked to provide feedback of your peers' work.


Individual assignments will have specific requirements listed on the assignment sheet, which the instructor will make available on the day the homework is assigned. If you have questions about how your assignment was graded, please see the TA or instructor.

Assignments and coursework
Grades will be determined as follows:

20% in-class work
20% reading reflections
60% assignments
You are expected to produce work in all of the assignments that reflects the highest standards of professionalism. For written documents, this means proper spelling, grammar, and formatting.

Late assignments will not be accepted; if your assignment is late, you will receive a zero score. Again, if you run into an issue that necessitates an extension, please reach out. Final projects cannot be turned in late and are not eligible for any extension whatsoever.

Academic integrity and plagiarism
Students are expected to adhere to rules around academic integrity. Simply stated, academic integrity means that you are to do your own work in all of your classes, unless collaboration is part of an assignment as defined in the course. In any case, you must be responsible for citing and acknowledging outside sources of ideas in work you submit.

Please be aware of the HCDE Department's and the UW's policies on plagiarism and academic misconduct: HCDE Academic Conduct policy. This policy will be strictly enforced.

Other academic integrity resources:

Center for Teaching and Learning: Cheating or Plagiarism
University of Washington Student Academic Responsibility (PDF)
Disability and accommodations
As part of ensuring that the class is as accessible as possible, the instructors are entirely comfortable with you using whatever form of note-taking method or recording is most comfortable to you, including laptops and audio recording devices. The instructors will do their best to ensure that all slides and scripts/notes are immediately available online after a lecture has concluded. In addition, if asked ahead of time we can try to record the audio of individial lectures for students who have learning differences that make audiovisual notes preferable to written ones.

If you require additional accommodations, please contact Disabled Student Services: 448 Schmitz, 206-543-8924 (V/TTY). If you have a letter from DSS indicating that you have a disability which requires academic accommodations, please present the letter to the instructors so we can discuss the accommodations you might need in the class. If you have any questions about this policy, reach out to the instructors directly.

For more information on disability accommodations, and how to apply for one, please review UW's Disability Resources for Students.

WPI,"Robots, AI & Ethics",https://wp.wpi.edu/forwrd/nrt-courses/,Found,"Robotics and AI systems are transforming our world in remarkable and unpredictable ways. From robots in medicine and nursing, to self-driving cars, to automated decision making in human resource management, new technologies shape how we create, exchange, and distribute value. As such, these technologies raise questions about the future of work and workers: will AI, robotics, and other ‘autonomous and intelligent systems’ make human labor obsolete? Or, are we more likely to see a continuous demand in human skills and capabilities despite the push for automation? Will future jobs be able to foster human creativity and ingenuity? Can new technologies be a remedy to existing inequities and injustices, or only make them more acute? The course addresses these and similar questions from the perspective of design and technology ethics. The course will include an introduction to design and technology ethics, an introduction to general trends in changing ecosystems of work and technology, a closer look at the human-machine interface in different types of industries, and case studies focusing on the integration of anticipatory ethics into the design of AI or robotic technologies. The final deliverable for this course will be a draft of a thesis/dissertation chapter/section that focses on broader impacts, social implications, research ethics, or related issues in students’ graduate projects. As part of this course, students will also learn to apply National Science Foundation’s (NSF) broader impacts framework to their graduate projects and future grant applications.                                                                                            Engineers and other technologists are increasingly more aware of the ethical, legal, and social impacts of robotics and artificial intelligence. Some of them actively contribute to the creation and communication of new sets of ethical standards, such as the work done by IEEE’s Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. What are the ethical principles that underpin these new standards? Since robots and AI Systems are designed to work with or alongside humans, do people have a right to understand what autonomous systems are doing and why? How can roboticists and AI designers ensure that these systems are transparent and explainable? This course focuses on the communication of ethical and social impacts of scientific research and technology development. After learning about major debates in robot/AI/data ethics, students will cultivate skills to (1) conceptualize ethical inquiries in technology design and (2) articulate them in writing and other forms of scholarly communication. As part of this course, students will learn to apply the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) broader impacts framework to their writing projects (dissertation, thesis, journal publication, grant application, etc. ).",,"Robotics and AI systems are transforming our world in remarkable and unpredictable ways.

These techniquesdeal with accessing, transforming, manipulating, visualizing, exploring and reasoning about data where the locational component is important (spatial data). The course introduces the types of spatial data relevant in social science inquiry and reviews a range of methods to explore these data. The types of data considered include observations at the point level (e.g., locations of crimes, commercial establishments, traffic accidents), data gathered for aggregate units, such as census tracts or counties (e.g.,unemployment rates, disease rates by area, crime rates), and data measured at spatially located sampling points (such as air quality monitoring stations and urban sensors). Specifictopics covered includethe implementation offormal spatial data structures, geovisualization and visual analytics, spatial autocorrelation analysis, variogram analysis, cluster detection, regionalization, point pattern analysisand spatial data mining. An important aspect of the course is to learn and apply open source geospatial software tools, such asR and GeoDa.Objectives1.Learn principles of spatial data science and its application to social science research questions2.Learn to distinguish which methods are appropriate for a given research question
23.Gain an appreciation for the assumptions and limitations associated with each technique4.Learn how to interpret and present the results of a spatial data analysis in a coherent fashion5.Learn how to use appropriate open source software tools to carry out spatial data analytical applicationsOrganizationThe class will meet twice a week in a lecture/lab format. The lab sessions are on Mondays in the Computer Science Instructional Lab (CSIL), on the first floorof theCrerar Library. The lecture is on Wednesdays in a location TBA.The computer lab will have all required software installed. However, you are strongly encouraged to use your own laptopand install the software yourself (everything iscross-platform,free and open source).The course will use Chalk as the main communication mechanism. All required readings, software guides and data will be available fromthe course site.All assignments, papers etc. must be submitted as a pdf digital file: NO PAPER and no Word docs, no exceptions.RequirementsThe main goal for the course is for you to completea final project/paperthat carries outan in-depth spatial data analysis of a research problem of your choice. You willapplya subset of the methods covered in class and useyour own data or data provided by the instructor (your own data is preferred).  This paper will be due at the end of the semester.Over the course of the semester, there will be three intermediate deadlines, with deliverables that are part of the grading of the final paper:•A fully spelled-out research question (including a brief description of the data to be used) –1p., due Oct. 12•A descriptive analysis of the spatial characteristics of the main variables in the study –max 2pp.(not including graphs and figures), due Oct. 26•A detailed outline of the final paper –2pp., due Nov. 9•Final paper is due Dec. 5More details will be providedin class and on the Chalk course web site as the quarter progresses.In addition, there will be eight weekly assignments,each consistingofshort computational exercisesthat use specificspatial analytical software (GeoDa andR).The assignments are graded pass/fail and you must pass all eight (and complete on time) in order to be able to receive an A grade in the course. If you don’t passat least 
3six, you will fail the course. You can re-do an assignment as many times as necessary in order to reach the requiredsix, but only on-time assignments can result in an A grade.SoftwareThe class uses only open source software (free and cross-platform). The software will be installed in the CSIL computer lab, but you are strongly encouraged to install it on your own machine. Everything can be readily downloaded from the web.•GeoDa, available from http://geodacenter.github.io/download.html•Rand its associated spatial data analysis packages, especially spdep, gstatand spatstat, everything available from http://cran.r-project.org•Recommended: jupyternotebooks, available from http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html(requires a Python installation, preferably through the Anaconda distribution –see instructions on the jupyter web site)ReadingsThere is no text for the course. There are many excellent books on data science, but to date thetreatment ofspatial aspectsis still in its infancy. The lecture slides provide the formal background. Specific readings will be assigned each week and made available on the course Chalk web site.General background can be found in the following annotated bibliography (these are not required reading, but provided as a guide to the literature)GeoDa•https://spatial.uchicago.edu/geodaoa brief description of the GeoDa functionality•http://geodacenter.github.io/documentation.htmloslides with an overview of the functionality in Version 1.8•Luc Anselin (2005).

These techniquesdeal with accessing, transforming, manipulating, visualizing, exploring and reasoning about data where the locational component is important (spatial data). The course introduces the types of spatial data relevant in social science inquiry and reviews a range of methods to explore these data. The types of data considered include observations at the point level (e.g., locations of crimes, commercial establishments, traffic accidents), data gathered for aggregate units, such as census tracts or counties (e.g.,unemployment rates, disease rates by area, crime rates), and data measured at spatially located sampling points (such as air quality monitoring stations and urban sensors). Specifictopics covered includethe implementation offormal spatial data structures, geovisualization and visual analytics, spatial autocorrelation analysis, variogram analysis, cluster detection, regionalization, point pattern analysisand spatial data mining. An important aspect of the course is to learn and apply open source geospatial software tools, such asR and GeoDa.Objectives1.Learn principles of spatial data science and its application to social science research questions2.Learn to distinguish which methods are appropriate for a given research question
23.Gain an appreciation for the assumptions and limitations associated with each technique4.Learn how to interpret and present the results of a spatial data analysis in a coherent fashion5.Learn how to use appropriate open source software tools to carry out spatial data analytical applicationsOrganizationThe class will meet twice a week in a lecture/lab format. The lab sessions are on Mondays in the Computer Science Instructional Lab (CSIL), on the first floorof theCrerar Library. The lecture is on Wednesdays in a location TBA.The computer lab will have all required software installed. However, you are strongly encouraged to use your own laptopand install the software yourself (everything iscross-platform,free and open source).The course will use Chalk as the main communication mechanism. All required readings, software guides and data will be available fromthe course site.All assignments, papers etc. must be submitted as a pdf digital file: NO PAPER and no Word docs, no exceptions.RequirementsThe main goal for the course is for you to completea final project/paperthat carries outan in-depth spatial data analysis of a research problem of your choice. You willapplya subset of the methods covered in class and useyour own data or data provided by the instructor (your own data is preferred).  This paper will be due at the end of the semester.Over the course of the semester, there will be three intermediate deadlines, with deliverables that are part of the grading of the final paper:•A fully spelled-out research question (including a brief description of the data to be used) –1p., due Oct. 12•A descriptive analysis of the spatial characteristics of the main variables in the study –max 2pp.(not including graphs and figures), due Oct. 26•A detailed outline of the final paper –2pp., due Nov. 9•Final paper is due Dec. 5More details will be providedin class and on the Chalk course web site as the quarter progresses.In addition, there will be eight weekly assignments,each consistingofshort computational exercisesthat use specificspatial analytical software (GeoDa andR).The assignments are graded pass/fail and you must pass all eight (and complete on time) in order to be able to receive an A grade in the course. If you don’t passat least 
3six, you will fail the course. You can re-do an assignment as many times as necessary in order to reach the requiredsix, but only on-time assignments can result in an A grade.SoftwareThe class uses only open source software (free and cross-platform). The software will be installed in the CSIL computer lab, but you are strongly encouraged to install it on your own machine. Everything can be readily downloaded from the web.•GeoDa, available from http://geodacenter.github.io/download.html•Rand its associated spatial data analysis packages, especially spdep, gstatand spatstat, everything available from http://cran.r-project.org•Recommended: jupyternotebooks, available from http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html(requires a Python installation, preferably through the Anaconda distribution –see instructions on the jupyter web site)ReadingsThere is no text for the course. There are many excellent books on data science, but to date thetreatment ofspatial aspectsis still in its infancy. The lecture slides provide the formal background. Specific readings will be assigned each week and made available on the course Chalk web site.General background can be found in the following annotated bibliography (these are not required reading, but provided as a guide to the literature)GeoDa•https://spatial.uchicago.edu/geodaoa brief description of the GeoDa functionality•http://geodacenter.github.io/documentation.htmloslides with an overview of the functionality in Version 1.8•Luc Anselin (2005).

Course Goals
Creating technologies that are inclusive of people in marginalized communities involves more than having technically sophisticated algorithms, systems, and infrastructure. It involves deeply understanding various community needs and using this understanding coupled with our knowledge of how people think and behave to design user-facing interfaces that can enhance and augment human capabilities. When dealing with under-served and marginalized communities, achieving these goals requires us to think through how different constraints such as costs, access to resources, and various cognitive and physical capabilities shape what socio-technical systems can best address a particular issue. This course leverages human-computer interaction and the tools, techniques, and principles that guide research on people to introduce you to the concepts of inclusive technology design. You will learn about different underserved and marginalized communities such as children, the elderly, those needing assistive technology, and users in developing countries, and their particular needs. In addition, you will learn how to be mindful of working with populations that can easily be exploited and how to think creatively of inclusive technology solutions. You will also put your skills into practice in a semester long group project involving the creation of an interactive system for one of the user populations we study.
Course Outcomes
• Build on knowledge of user-centered design process and the appropriateness of the individual methods for a given problem
• Employ selected design methods and evaluation methods at a basic level of competence
   Page 1 of 13

CMSC 20370/30370: Inclusive Technology Winter 2020
• Build prototypes at varying levels of fidelity, from paper prototypes to functional, interactive prototypes
Evaluation Criteria
The following assignments will be due throughout the semester:
• Group Project (45%)
• Individual Assignments (30%)
• Midterm (15%)
• Class Quizzes (5%)
• Attendance and Participation (5%)
All assignments are due by the beginning of class on the due date and must be submitted via CANVAS. If you have any problems with submission, please email the assignment to the teaching assistants.
Group Project (45 %)
Group cooperation and communication skills are essential in working with user experience and software development teams. The group project will bring all components of the course together in a semester-long project with teams of 3-4 members. Teams will be allowed to pick their own topic with guidance from the instructor. The project will allow students to apply the user- centered design methods discussed in class to inform the design of a working prototype. Each assignment will be graded out of 100 points and converted to a score out of 45 with the following weightings for the final group project grade:
• GP0 – Project Group Formation and Website – 10 points
• GP1 – Project Proposal - 20 points
• GP2 – Design Alternatives and Project Poster - 20 points
• GP3 – Low Fidelity Prototype and Evaluation - 20 points
• GP4 – Final Prototype, Evaluation, and Project Video - 30 points
Individual Assignments (30 %)
You will complete three graded assignments. Unless specified by the instructor, assignments must be completed independently. Each assignment will be graded out of 100 points and converted to a score out of 35 with the following weightings for the final individual assignments grade:
• IA1 – Introduction and CITI Training – 20 points
• IA2 – Design Critique and Proposed Redesign – 60 points
• IA3 – Peer Evaluation – 20 points
Midterm (15 %)
There will be a midterm. If you complete the required readings, attend class, and complete your assignments in a timely fashion, you will be well prepared for the midterm.
Page 2 of 13

CMSC 20370/30370: Inclusive Technology Winter 2020
Class Quizzes (5 %)
At the beginning of each class, we will have a 5-10 minute quiz. You will be asked three multiple choice questions about the reading for that class period. If you have done the reading, you should be able to answer these questions very easily. The lowest three quiz scores will be discarded for calculating the final score for your class quizzes. If you are not present at a class, you will receive a zero score for that quiz.
Class Participation (5 %)
Students are expected to fully participate in all class activities to gain the most benefits from the class. You should come to class prepared to discuss any assigned readings as well as to provide your perspectives on these readings. You will also be expected to participate in group discussions and other in-classroom activities. The effectiveness of the course depends on the quality of your participation and willingness to internalize the skills and concepts covered in the course and efforts to apply them to real-world settings.
CMSC 20370 and CMSC 30370
Students enrolled in CMSC 30370 will be expected to do at least one of the optional readings each week in addition to the required readings. CMSC 30370 students will also be expected to produce a higher fidelity prototype in their group project.
Books and Web Resources
The required readings will be posted on the course website as PDF documents. The following books are not required but are recommended for further reading. These books are all available on Amazon.com.
• Supplemental: The Design of Everyday Things by Norman, D., Basic Books, Editions from 2013 onwards.
• Supplemental: Interaction – Beyond Human Computer by Preece, J., Rogers, Y., and Sharp, H., Wiley, Editions from 2011 onwards.

Policies on Academic Honesty, Plagiarism, and Conduct
The University of Chicago has formal policies related to academic honesty and plagiarism. We abide by these standards in this course. Depending on the severity of the offense, you risk being dismissed altogether from the course. All cases will be referred to the Dean of Students office, which may impose further penalties, including suspension and expulsion.

CMSC 20370/30370: Inclusive Technology Winter 2020
You are permitted to talk to the course staff and to your fellow students about any of the problem sets. Any assistance, though, must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write out his or her own solutions to the problem sets. Consulting another student's solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source. These and any other form of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating.
No collaboration is permitted on reading responses or the midterm. All work submitted for the project must properly cite ideas and work that are not those of the students in the group.
If you have any question about whether some activity would constitute cheating, please feel free to ask. Simply stated, feel free to discuss problems with each other, but do not cheat. It is not worth it, and you will get caught.
In addition, we expect all students to treat everyone else in the course with respect, following the norms of proper behavior by members of the University of Chicago community.
Wellness
If a personal emergency comes up that might impact your work in the class, please let Marshini know so that the course staff can make appropriate arrangements.
University environments can sometimes be very overwhelming, and all of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. The University of Chicago's counseling services are here to support you. Consider also reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:
• Student Counseling Urgent Care: (773)702-9800 or in person.
• National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255
Late Policy
We understand that sometimes life events occur and that it is not always possible to meet every deadline. As such, we are willing to accept late assignments according to the following policy:
• You start the term with a grace period ""balance"" of 96 hours.
• Each assignment will be due at 11:30 a.m. (Chicago Local Time) on the due date.
   Page 4 of 13

CMSC 20370/30370: Inclusive Technology Winter 2020
• For each assignment, every hour late (or fraction thereof) that you turn in the assignment will subtract one hour from your grace-period balance. For example, if you turn in your assignment at 12:32 p.m. on the due date, we will count this as two hours against your grace period.
• As long as your grace period balance is positive, you can turn in any assignment late without penalty.
• Once your grace period balance reaches zero, you will receive half credit for any assignment that you turn in, as long as you turn it in within one week of the due date. If your grace period balance is zero and you turn in an assignment more than one week late, you will receive no credit for the assignment.
• Excuses with medical documentation are a legitimate exception and will not count against your late period.
• Any other reasons for lateness and including but not limited to interviews, conferences are not considered legitimate excuses and any resulting lateness will count against your grace period.
Important Note: You must still turn in all assignments to pass the course, even if you receive zero points on an assignment. Turning in all assignments is a necessary condition for passing.
SCHEDULE OF TOPICS (SUBJECT TO CHANGE)
The following schedule lists the major topics, which will be subject to change throughout the semester. Readings for each week are posted on the course website – please ensure that you complete the reading response and readings for each week by the start of class in that week.

Inclusive Technology: Design For Underserved and Marginalized Communities
Creating technologies that are inclusive of people in marginalized communities involves more than having technically sophisticated algorithms, systems, and infrastructure. It involves deeply understanding various community needs and using this understanding coupled with our knowledge of how people think and behave to design user-facing interfaces that can enhance and augment human capabilities. When dealing with under-served and marginalized communities, achieving these goals requires us to think through how different constraints such as costs, access to resources, and various cognitive and physical capabilities shape what socio-technical systems can best address a particular issue. This course leverages human-computer interaction and the tools, techniques, and principles that guide research on people to introduce you to the concepts of inclusive technology design. You will learn about different underserved and marginalized communities such as children, the elderly, those needing assistive technology, and users in developing countries, and their particular needs. In addition, you will learn how to be mindful of working with populations that can easily be exploited and how to think creatively of inclusive technology solutions. You will also put your skills into practice in a semester long group project involving the creation of an interactive system for one of the user populations we study.
Course Outcomes
• Build on knowledge of user-centered design process and the appropriateness of the individual methods for a given problem
• Employ selected design methods and evaluation methods at a basic level of competence
   Page 1 of 13

CMSC 20370/30370: Inclusive Technology Winter 2020
• Build prototypes at varying levels of fidelity, from paper prototypes to functional, interactive prototypes
Evaluation Criteria
The following assignments will be due throughout the semester:
• Group Project (45%)
• Individual Assignments (30%)
• Midterm (15%)
• Class Quizzes (5%)
• Attendance and Participation (5%)
All assignments are due by the beginning of class on the due date and must be submitted via CANVAS. If you have any problems with submission, please email the assignment to the teaching assistants.
Group Project (45 %)
Group cooperation and communication skills are essential in working with user experience and software development teams. The group project will bring all components of the course together in a semester-long project with teams of 3-4 members. Teams will be allowed to pick their own topic with guidance from the instructor. The project will allow students to apply the user- centered design methods discussed in class to inform the design of a working prototype. Each assignment will be graded out of 100 points and converted to a score out of 45 with the following weightings for the final group project grade:
• GP0 – Project Group Formation and Website – 10 points
• GP1 – Project Proposal - 20 points
• GP2 – Design Alternatives and Project Poster - 20 points
• GP3 – Low Fidelity Prototype and Evaluation - 20 points
• GP4 – Final Prototype, Evaluation, and Project Video - 30 points
Individual Assignments (30 %)
You will complete three graded assignments. Unless specified by the instructor, assignments must be completed independently. Each assignment will be graded out of 100 points and converted to a score out of 35 with the following weightings for the final individual assignments grade:
• IA1 – Introduction and CITI Training – 20 points
• IA2 – Design Critique and Proposed Redesign – 60 points
• IA3 – Peer Evaluation – 20 points
Midterm (15 %)
There will be a midterm. If you complete the required readings, attend class, and complete your assignments in a timely fashion, you will be well prepared for the midterm.
Page 2 of 13

CMSC 20370/30370: Inclusive Technology Winter 2020
Class Quizzes (5 %)
At the beginning of each class, we will have a 5-10 minute quiz. You will be asked three multiple choice questions about the reading for that class period. If you have done the reading, you should be able to answer these questions very easily. The lowest three quiz scores will be discarded for calculating the final score for your class quizzes. If you are not present at a class, you will receive a zero score for that quiz.
Class Participation (5 %)
Students are expected to fully participate in all class activities to gain the most benefits from the class. You should come to class prepared to discuss any assigned readings as well as to provide your perspectives on these readings. You will also be expected to participate in group discussions and other in-classroom activities. The effectiveness of the course depends on the quality of your participation and willingness to internalize the skills and concepts covered in the course and efforts to apply them to real-world settings.
CMSC 20370 and CMSC 30370
Students enrolled in CMSC 30370 will be expected to do at least one of the optional readings each week in addition to the required readings. CMSC 30370 students will also be expected to produce a higher fidelity prototype in their group project.
Books and Web Resources
The required readings will be posted on the course website as PDF documents. The following books are not required but are recommended for further reading. These books are all available on Amazon.com.
• Supplemental: The Design of Everyday Things by Norman, D., Basic Books, Editions from 2013 onwards.
• Supplemental: Interaction – Beyond Human Computer by Preece, J., Rogers, Y., and Sharp, H., Wiley, Editions from 2011 onwards.

Policies on Academic Honesty, Plagiarism, and Conduct
The University of Chicago has formal policies related to academic honesty and plagiarism. We abide by these standards in this course. Depending on the severity of the offense, you risk being dismissed altogether from the course. All cases will be referred to the Dean of Students office, which may impose further penalties, including suspension and expulsion.

CMSC 20370/30370: Inclusive Technology Winter 2020
You are permitted to talk to the course staff and to your fellow students about any of the problem sets. Any assistance, though, must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write out his or her own solutions to the problem sets. Consulting another student's solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source. These and any other form of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating.
No collaboration is permitted on reading responses or the midterm. All work submitted for the project must properly cite ideas and work that are not those of the students in the group.
If you have any question about whether some activity would constitute cheating, please feel free to ask. Simply stated, feel free to discuss problems with each other, but do not cheat. It is not worth it, and you will get caught.
In addition, we expect all students to treat everyone else in the course with respect, following the norms of proper behavior by members of the University of Chicago community.
Wellness
If a personal emergency comes up that might impact your work in the class, please let Marshini know so that the course staff can make appropriate arrangements.
University environments can sometimes be very overwhelming, and all of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. The University of Chicago's counseling services are here to support you. Consider also reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:
• Student Counseling Urgent Care: (773)702-9800 or in person.
• National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255
Late Policy
We understand that sometimes life events occur and that it is not always possible to meet every deadline. As such, we are willing to accept late assignments according to the following policy:
• You start the term with a grace period ""balance"" of 96 hours.
• Each assignment will be due at 11:30 a.m. (Chicago Local Time) on the due date.
   Page 4 of 13

CMSC 20370/30370: Inclusive Technology Winter 2020
• For each assignment, every hour late (or fraction thereof) that you turn in the assignment will subtract one hour from your grace-period balance. For example, if you turn in your assignment at 12:32 p.m. on the due date, we will count this as two hours against your grace period.
• As long as your grace period balance is positive, you can turn in any assignment late without penalty.
• Once your grace period balance reaches zero, you will receive half credit for any assignment that you turn in, as long as you turn it in within one week of the due date. If your grace period balance is zero and you turn in an assignment more than one week late, you will receive no credit for the assignment.
• Excuses with medical documentation are a legitimate exception and will not count against your late period.
• Any other reasons for lateness and including but not limited to interviews, conferences are not considered legitimate excuses and any resulting lateness will count against your grace period.
Important Note: You must still turn in all assignments to pass the course, even if you receive zero points on an assignment. Turning in all assignments is a necessary condition for passing.
SCHEDULE OF TOPICS (SUBJECT TO CHANGE)
The following schedule lists the major topics, which will be subject to change throughout the semester. Readings for each week are posted on the course website – please ensure that you complete the reading response and readings for each week by the start of class in that week.

",Inclusive Technology Winter 2020  Inclusive Technology Design For Underserved and Marginalized Communities  Creating technologies that are inclusive of people in marginalized communities involves more than having technically sophisticated algorithms systems and infrastructure It involves deeply understanding various community needs and using this understanding coupled with our knowledge of how people think and behave to design userfacing interfaces that can enhance and augment human capabilities When dealing with underserved and marginalized communities achieving these goals requires us to think through how different constraints such as costs access to resources and various cognitive and physical capabilities shape what sociotechnical systems can best address a particular issue This course leverages humancomputer interaction and the tools techniques and principles that guide research on people to introduce you to the concepts of inclusive technology design You will learn about different underserved and marginalized communities such as children the elderly those needing assistive technology and users in developing countries and their particular needs In addition you will learn how to be mindful of working with populations that can easily be exploited and how to think creatively of inclusive technology solutions You will also put your skills into practice in a semester long group project involving the creation of an interactive system for one of the user populations we study  Build on knowledge of usercentered design process and the appropriateness of the individual methods for a given problem     Employ selected design methods and evaluation methods at a basic level of competence        1 of 13    Inclusive Technology      Build prototypes at varying levels of fidelity from paper prototypes to functional interactive prototypes  Evaluation Criteria  The following assignments will be due throughout the semester  All assignments are due by the beginning of class on the due date and must be submitted via CANVAS If you have any problems with submission please email the assignment to the teaching assistants  Group cooperation and communication skills are essential in working with user experience and software development teams The group project will bring all components of the course together in a semesterlong project with teams of 34 members Teams will be allowed to pick their own topic with guidance from the instructor The project will allow students to apply the user centered design methods discussed in class to inform the design of a working prototype Each assignment will be graded out of 100 points and converted to a score out of 45 with the following weightings for the final group project grade     GP0    Project Group Formation and Website    10 points     GP1    Project Proposal  20 points     GP2    Design Alternatives and Project Poster  20 points     GP3    Low Fidelity Prototype and Evaluation  20 points     GP4    Final Prototype Evaluation and Project Video  30 points  You will complete three graded assignments Unless specified by the instructor assignments must be completed independently Each assignment will be graded out of 100 points and converted to a score out of 35 with the following weightings for the final individual assignments grade     IA1    Introduction and CITI Training    20 points     IA2    Design Critique and Proposed Redesign    60 points     IA3    Peer Evaluation    20 points    There will be a midterm If you complete the s attend class and complete your assignments in a timely fashion you will be well prepared for the midterm      Inclusive Technology Winter 2020    At the beginning of each class we will have a 510 minute quiz You will be asked three multiple choice questions about the reading for that class period If you have done the reading you should be able to answer these questions very easily The lowest three quiz scores will be discarded for calculating the final score for your class quizzes If you are not present at a class you will receive a zero score for that quiz    Students are expected to fully participate in all class activities to gain the most benefits from the class You should come to class prepared to discuss any assigned readings as well as to provide your perspectives on these readings You will also be expected to participate in group discussions and other inclassroom activities The effectiveness of the course depends on the quality of your participation and willingness to internalize the skills and concepts covered in the course and efforts to apply them to realworld settings  Students enrolled in CMSC 30370 will be expected to do at least one of the s each week in addition to the s CMSC 30370 students will also be expected to produce a higher fidelity prototype in their group project  Books and Web Resources  The s will be posted on the course website as PDF documents The following books are not required but are recommended for further reading These books are all available on Amazoncom  The Design of Everyday Things     Supplemental Interaction    Beyond Human Computer      Supplemental Research Methods in HumanComputer Interaction     Supplemental  Policies on Academic Honesty Plagiarism and Conduct  The University of Chicago has formal policies related to academic honesty and plagiarism We abide by these standards in this course Depending on the severity of the offense you risk being dismissed altogether from the course All cases will be referred to the Dean of Students office which may impose further penalties including suspension and expulsion   Rescuing Social Change From The Cult Of Technology       3 of 13    Inclusive Technology Winter 2020  You are permitted to talk to the course staff and to your fellow students about any of the problem sets Any assistance though must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution Each student must write out his or her own solutions to the problem sets Consulting another students solution is prohibited and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source These and any other form of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating  No collaboration is permitted on reading responses or the midterm All work submitted for the project must properly cite ideas and work that are not those of the students in the group  If you have any question about whether some activity would constitute cheating please feel free to ask Simply stated feel free to discuss problems with each other but do not cheat It is not worth it and you will get caught  In addition we expect all students to treat everyone else in the course with respect following the norms of proper behavior by members of the University of Chicago community  Wellness  If a personal emergency comes up that might impact your work in the class please let Marshini know so that the course staff can make appropriate arrangements  University environments can sometimes be very overwhelming and all of us benefit from support during times of struggle You are not alone There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress difficult life events or feelings like anxiety or depression we strongly encourage you to seek support The University of Chicagos counseling services are here to support you Consider also reaching out to a friend faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help  If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of selfharm call someone immediately day or night     Student Counseling Urgent Care 7737029800 or in person     National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 18002738255  Late Policy  We understand that sometimes life events occur and that it is not always possible to meet every deadline As such we are willing to accept late assignments according to the following policy     You start the term with a grace period balance of 96 hours     Each assignment will be due at 1130 am Chicago Local Time on the due date        4 of 13    Inclusive Technology     For each assignment every hour late or fraction thereof that you turn in the assignment will subtract one hour from your graceperiod balance For example if you turn in your assignment at 1232 pm on the due date we will count this as two hours against your grace period     As long as your grace period balance is positive you can turn in any assignment late without penalty     Once your grace period balance reaches zero you will receive half credit for any assignment that you turn in as long as you turn it in within one week of the due date If your grace period balance is zero and you turn in an assignment more than one week late you will receive no credit for the assignment     Excuses with medical documentation are a legitimate exception and will not count against your late period     Any other reasons for lateness and including but not limited to interviews conferences are not considered legitimate excuses and any resulting lateness will count against your grace period  Important Note You must still turn in all assignments to pass the course even if you receive zero points on an assignment Turning in all assignments is a necessary condition for passing  SCHEDULE OF TOPICS SUBJECT TO CHANGE  The following schedule lists the major topics which will be subject to change throughout the semester Readings for each week are posted on the course website    please ensure that you complete the reading response and readings for each week by the start of class in that week  Week Date Topic Individual Group Assignment Project                  1  Jan 6  What Is Inclusive Technology          Technology is not the answer Do artifacts

Science and technology intersect with myriad areas of public policy. Think of the regulatory failures behind patient deaths from Vioxx; the emergence of funding for embryonic stem cell research as a major political issue; the debate over the reality and extent of climate change; and widespread public perception of eroding American research and development competitiveness in a globalizing world. Discussion of these salient issues often turns back to a common set of questions about the relationship between science and policy. Is scientific and technological development a force beyond human control, or can it be governed? Is more and better science necessary for public political decision making? Can only scientists judge the value of scientific research programs or the validity of scientific results? Is the furtherance of scientific understanding always socially benign, and who decides?
This course examines such questions by surveying the variety of interactions between science, technology, and policy, focusing primarily on the American context, but also including comparative perspectives. The approach is multidisciplinary, drawing upon literature in a wide range of disciplines including political science, philosophy, economics, sociology, and history. It will provide students:
• Background on science and technology policy environment
• Multidisciplinary toolkit for thinking about science and technology policy
• Multidisciplinary methods for influencing science and technology policy
• Understanding of the “social science” of science and technology policy
• Expertise in conducting and presenting policy analysis
PubPol 650 is a core course in the Science, Technology, and Public Policy (STPP) Graduate Certificate Program. It is designed for graduate students from diverse backgrounds, including public policy, public health, law, business, engineering and the social, biological, and physical sciences. No scientific or technical background is necessary. A basic understanding of the concepts of American government is very helpful, but not strictly required.
Course Requirements
1. Class preparation, attendance, and participation. You need to do the weekly readings and come to class prepared to discuss them. This preparation should not simply be a passive process of absorbing facts; rather, while reading, you should actively identify (and write down!) questions you have, possible avenues of discussion, and potential points of application of the readings to current events. Along these lines, I would encourage students to scan the headlines of science journals (e.g., Scientific
  
American, www.scientificamerican.com; or the New York Time’s Tuesday Science Times, www.nytimes.com) to seek application for the week’s readings. (10% of grade)
2. Reading Responses. To assist you in fulfilling (1), during the course of the semester, I would like you to produce six (6) reading response memos of roughly a page (single spaced) each. These do not need to be fancy! They could even be a simple list of insights or questions derived from the readings. They should be opportunities to refine questions and insights from the readings. You can also use these to explore ideas relevant to your policy analysis exercise (see point 3 below). They should be submitted to me at least two hours before the start of class on the week the readings will be discussed; I will draw on them to frame discussion and steer the conversation toward areas of use to you. (20% of grade).
3. Policy Analysis Exercise. This is the major assignment for the course, and accounts for 70% of your grade in its several components. Students will be asked to choose a facet of current science and technology policy (e.g., a program, a regulation, an oversight body) and then complete a series of assignments that, taken together, could be used to brief a policymaker. For suggestions on the kind of topics you might consider, see the list at the end of this syllabus (definitely not exhaustive). The components of the exercise are as follows. More detailed guidelines will be handed out as the due dates approach:
a. Background memo. Due by 17 October; maximum of 4 pages single spaced; worth 10% of your grade. Here you should give your hypothetical policymaker some context by examining some or all of the following questions. Why was the policy enacted? Who were the major players in the politics surrounding the controversy? What problem does the policy purport to solve? Is there controversy about the policy? If so, what is the nature of the policy and who is involved?
b. Policy assessment. Due by 20 November in class; maximum of 4 pages single spaced; worth 20% of your grade. Policy assessments go beyond backgrounders by examining the value outcomes of a policy – constituencies served, benefits, effectiveness, and so forth. Whom does this policy serve, or not serve? What values does it uphold or fail to uphold? Is the policy effective in meeting its stated goals? On what grounds is the policy “good” or “bad”?
c. Final paper. Due by 18 December at noon; maximum of 12 pages single spaced; worth 30% of your grade. The paper should revise and expand upon your earlier backgrounder and policy assessment, based on my feedback on those assignments. In addition, it will also contain a section that focuses on how your policy might be improved.
d. Presentation. To be given in-class during the exam period; approximately 8 minutes duration; worth 10% of your grade. This will lay out your policy problem and make a terse argument for your proposed changes in policy. The challenge will be to make good use of the relatively short time allotted. Bring whatever slides or visual materials you think will be helpful and appropriate.

Tuesdays 2:30-5:30 Office: 4207 Weill Hall 1210 Weill Hall
 Office Hours: T 10-11, W 10-11.
 Science and technology intersect with myriad areas of public policy. Think of the regulatory failures behind patient deaths from Vioxx; the emergence of funding for embryonic stem cell research as a major political issue; the debate over the reality and extent of climate change; and widespread public perception of eroding American research and development competitiveness in a globalizing world. Discussion of these salient issues often turns back to a common set of questions about the relationship between science and policy. Is scientific and technological development a force beyond human control, or can it be governed? Is more and better science necessary for public political decision making? Can only scientists judge the value of scientific research programs or the validity of scientific results? Is the furtherance of scientific understanding always socially benign, and who decides?
 This course examines such questions by surveying the variety of interactions between science, technology, and policy, focusing primarily on the American context, but also including comparative perspectives. The approach is multidisciplinary, drawing upon literature in a wide range of disciplines including political science, philosophy, economics, sociology, and history. It will provide students:
 • Background on science and technology policy environment
 • Multidisciplinary toolkit for thinking about science and technology policy
 • Multidisciplinary methods for influencing science and technology policy
 • Understanding of the “social science” of science and technology policy
 • Expertise in conducting and presenting policy analysis
 PubPol 650 is a core course in the Science, Technology, and Public Policy (STPP) Graduate Certificate Program. It is designed for graduate students from diverse backgrounds, including public policy, public health, law, business, engineering and the social, biological, and physical sciences. No scientific or technical background is necessary. A basic understanding of the concepts of American government is very helpful, but not strictly required.
 Course Requirements
 1. Class preparation, attendance, and participation. You need to do the weekly readings and come to class prepared to discuss them. This preparation should not simply be a passive process of absorbing facts; rather, while reading, you should actively identify (and write down!) questions you have, possible avenues of discussion, and potential points of application of the readings to current events. Along these lines, I would encourage students to scan the headlines of science journals (e.g., Scientific
  
 American, www.scientificamerican.com; or the New York Time’s Tuesday Science Times, www.nytimes.com) to seek application for the week’s readings. (10% of grade)
 2. Reading Responses. To assist you in fulfilling (1), during the course of the semester, I would like you to produce six (6) reading response memos of roughly a page (single spaced) each. These do not need to be fancy! They could even be a simple list of insights or questions derived from the readings. They should be opportunities to refine questions and insights from the readings. You can also use these to explore ideas relevant to your policy analysis exercise (see point 3 below). They should be submitted to me at least two hours before the start of class on the week the readings will be discussed; I will draw on them to frame discussion and steer the conversation toward areas of use to you. (20% of grade).
 3. Policy Analysis Exercise. This is the major assignment for the course, and accounts for 70% of your grade in its several components. Students will be asked to choose a facet of current science and technology policy (e.g., a program, a regulation, an oversight body) and then complete a series of assignments that, taken together, could be used to brief a policymaker. For suggestions on the kind of topics you might consider, see the list at the end of this syllabus (definitely not exhaustive). The components of the exercise are as follows. More detailed guidelines will be handed out as the due dates approach:
 a. Background memo. Due by 17 October; maximum of 4 pages single spaced; worth 10% of your grade. Here you should give your hypothetical policymaker some context by examining some or all of the following questions. Why was the policy enacted? Who were the major players in the politics surrounding the controversy? What problem does the policy purport to solve? Is there controversy about the policy? If so, what is the nature of the policy and who is involved?
 b. Policy assessment. Due by 20 November in class; maximum of 4 pages single spaced; worth 20% of your grade. Policy assessments go beyond backgrounders by examining the value outcomes of a policy – constituencies served, benefits, effectiveness, and so forth. Whom does this policy serve, or not serve? What values does it uphold or fail to uphold? Is the policy effective in meeting its stated goals? On what grounds is the policy “good” or “bad”?
 c. Final paper. Due by 18 December at noon; maximum of 12 pages single spaced; worth 30% of your grade. The paper should revise and expand upon your earlier backgrounder and policy assessment, based on my feedback on those assignments. In addition, it will also contain a section that focuses on how your policy might be improved.
 d. Presentation. To be given in-class during the exam period; approximately 8 minutes duration; worth 10% of your grade. This will lay out your policy problem and make a terse argument for your proposed changes in policy. The challenge will be to make good use of the relatively short time allotted. Bring whatever slides or visual materials you think will be helpful and appropriate.

Course Description:

John H. Chestnut Professor Director, Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition University of Pennsylvania Law School csyoo@law.upenn.edu
 The promises of today’s emerging technologies include longer, healthier lives; safer, faster, and more efficient transportation; and immediate, far-reaching communication mechanisms. Recent advances in machine learning, autonomous systems, nanomaterials, and neurotechnologies offer the potential to dramatically change the way our global society lives, works and shares information. With such prolific power, these technologies also pose new challenges and risks such as reduced individual privacy; political repercussions; and inequitable access to the benefits of technology. Rapid technological innovation often outpaces and challenges established legal regulations, cultural norms, and societal frameworks of communications.
A robust civil discourse anchored in technical expertise, cultural context, and inclusivity can foster the optimization of the benefits of emerging technologies. This course is aimed in preparing undergraduate students to engage in and lead such discourses. The students will consider a series of engineering innovations from technical, legal and social perspectives and will hone the analytical and communication skills necessary to identify and address opportunities for civil discourse.
Interdisciplinary collaboration has proven fruitful in situating technological changes within their social, political, economic, and historical contexts. From an interdisciplinary lens, this course

will consider the intersection between technological innovations and civil discourse from two angles. One perspective will be to examine the civil discourses about technological innovations. What do global conversations and public debates concerning powerful, rapidly emerging technologies look like? What roles do various stakeholders – such as, engineers, the media, NGOs, government agencies, and citizens – play? How can such discourses be better served?
A second perspective will be to examine the technologies that have been shown to enable or thwart civil discourse. How have global and local communications been either advanced or stifled by the growing proliferation of social media and smart phones? Who holds the responsibility to foster the benefits and to mitigate the risks and unintended consequences of these technologies? How can individual citizens as well as larger institutions best engage in civil discourse by employing emerging technologies?
Course Format:
The class will meet synchronously at 5pm-8pm ET via Zoom. The weekly class meetings will include: (a) a guest speaker presenting scholarship within their field, selected to represent the various schools and departments across Penn; (b) a student-led discussion with the guest speaker; and (c) reading seminar discussions, anchored by student presentations and contextual material such as public policy papers, media coverage and other primary sources.
Student Coursework:
• Weekly Assigned Readings and Discussion Participation (20%)
o Students will write a weekly brief response to prompts based on the assigned
readings to prepare for class discussion. Participation in class will be evaluated.
• Rotating Presenters & Discussion Leaders (20%)
o Small teams of students will prepare discussion questions and lead the in-class discussion. Individually, each student leader will present on a short piece related to the assigned readings and guest speaker. Each student will be a class leader 2- 3 times/semester.
• Source Tracing Assignment (20%)
o Students will select a piece of journalism covering a topic of their choosing and
then trace the various sources. They will write an analytical response to how the piece was constructed, as well as how various stakeholders and communities of interest were represented or not in the piece.
• Final Project: Policy Paper and Presentation (40%)
o The final project for the course will be a policy paper in which students select a
topic and (a) analyze the discourse around that topic and (b) propose policy
guidance.
o Students should analyze the discourse about a selected topic and identify
potential areas of communication breakdown, offering policy guidance on where scientific information is most needed and how best to create a more robust,

evidence-based and equitable civil discourse. Students should propose at least one concrete proposal for improvement.

How have global and local communications been either advanced or stifled by the growing proliferation of social media and smart phones? Who holds the responsibility to foster the benefits and to mitigate the risks and unintended consequences of these technologies? How can individual citizens as well as larger institutions best engage in civil discourse by employing emerging technologies?
 Course Format:
 The class will meet synchronously at 5pm-8pm ET via Zoom. The weekly class meetings will include: (a) a guest speaker presenting scholarship within their field, selected to represent the various schools and departments across Penn; (b) a student-led discussion with the guest speaker; and (c) reading seminar discussions, anchored by student presentations and contextual material such as public policy papers, media coverage and other primary sources.
 Student Coursework:
 • Weekly Assigned Readings and Discussion Participation (20%)
 o Students will write a weekly brief response to prompts based on the assigned
 readings to prepare for class discussion. Participation in class will be evaluated.
 • Rotating Presenters & Discussion Leaders (20%)
 o Small teams of students will prepare discussion questions and lead the in-class discussion. Individually, each student leader will present on a short piece related to the assigned readings and guest speaker. Each student will be a class leader 2- 3 times/semester.
 • Source Tracing Assignment (20%)
 o Students will select a piece of journalism covering a topic of their choosing and
 then trace the various sources. They will write an analytical response to how the piece was constructed, as well as how various stakeholders and communities of interest were represented or not in the piece.
 • Final Project: Policy Paper and Presentation (40%)
 o The final project for the course will be a policy paper in which students select a
 topic and (a) analyze the discourse around that topic and (b) propose policy
 guidance.
 o Students should analyze the discourse about a selected topic and identify
 potential areas of communication breakdown, offering policy guidance on where scientific information is most needed and how best to create a more robust,
 
 evidence-based and equitable civil discourse. Students should propose at least one concrete proposal for improvement.

Course overview
This course is an introduction to the history and social study of technology. It begins with an examination of the concept of “technology” itself, which has been closely bound up with ideas of modernity, progress, expertise, and innovation since it came into wide use in the early twentieth century. It then turns to the history of industrialization since the eighteenth century, exploring the diverse factors — technical, economic, social, and cultural — that have contributed to the emergence and transformation of industrial societies. The third section of the course examines a few selected topics in depth, including the role of technology in war, environment, health, and computing, as well as the question of whether technological change can or should be controlled. The final section of the course is focused on small-group explorations of technology-related sites around Philadelphia. The course aims to strengthen your understanding of the historical roots and social contexts of contemporary technology and your skills in critically reading and writing historical and social-scientific texts.
Assignments and grading
Weekly responses (30%): At the beginning of most weeks during the semester (see schedule below for exceptions), you will be given a prompt related to the week’s readings and lectures. Your 100- to 200- word response is due via Canvas by Friday, 12:00pm (noon). Each response will be graded as either as not submitted (0%), unsatisfactory (70%), or satisfactory (100%). The due date is strict, and only responses submitted before the weekly deadline will receive credit. To avoid the risk of losing work-in- progress, you are encouraged to first write and edit your response in a document on your computer and then paste it into the text entry field on Canvas.
Group field-trip presentation (15%) and individual report (15%): Two weeks toward the end of the semester will be devoted to small-group explorations of technology at sites around Philadelphia. You will be assigned to a group based on your ranking of choices from a predetermined list of sites and will visit that site together with your group at a time of your own choosing. You should plan to take at least two hours for your site visit, including travel time; you may schedule the visit at any time, as long as it takes place before your group’s scheduled meeting with the instructor to discuss your observations and ideas about the site you have visited during the week of April 10/12 (there will be no lectures on these days). Your group will deliver a short presentation during the class session on either April 17 or April 19. You will also write a short individual reflection on your group’s site visit, which is due by 12:00pm (noon) on Friday, April 20.
Final exam (40%): The final exam will cover material from the entire semester.
Readings
There is one required book for the course, which is on reserve at Van Pelt Library and available for purchase at the Penn Bookstore (3601 Walnut St.). It can also be purchased as an ebook. All other readings are available as PDFs via the course’s Canvas website.

Course website
The course Canvas site can be found at https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1390652. Make sure that you have access to the site as soon as possible. You will need it throughout the semester to access readings, to submit assignments, to view grades and feedback, and to receive important announcements. You may want to check your Canvas settings to ensure that you are receiving notifications by email. Because technical problems sometimes occur, always double-check to be sure that your submitted assignments have been correctly uploaded.
A note on the use of electronic devices during lectures
Laptop computers can be a very efficient means of taking notes and searching through text, but they are also fantastically good at distracting not only their users but also those around them. You are therefore strongly encouraged to take lecture notes the old-fashioned way — that is, with a pen or pencil and paper. Precisely because it is slower and more laborious than typing for most people, writing by hand encourages you to think rather than simply to transcribe and to identify key ideas rather than getting lost in the details. If you do use a laptop to take notes in class, do not use it for social media, shopping, games, reading the news, working on assignments, or any other purposes unrelated to the lecture. Students who choose to use laptops, tablets, smartphones, or other electronic devices for such purposes — which are disruptive both to their learning and to the learning of others — will be asked to leave the classroom.
Academic integrity and non-discrimination policy
Although we all come to the course with different preparation, aims, and institutional positions, we are here to learn and discover together, and each of us is responsible for doing our part to create a respectful and productive classroom environment. Everyone involved with the course will be expected to abide by Penn’s Code of Academic Integrity. Because plagiarism and other violations of academic integrity undermine the learning process for the individual as well as for the broader academic community, they will result in a failing grade and possible disciplinary action. No form of harassment or discrimination on the basis of religion, race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, etc., by either the instructional staff or the students, will be tolerated. If you believe these policies are being violated or insufficiently enforced, please inform the instructor, your academic advisor, the College Office, and/or one of the other appropriate University of Pennsylvania offices (some of which are listed here).
Special accommodations
All appropriate efforts will be made to accommodate disability status, religious obligations, childcare and other family responsibilities, and other special needs. If you anticipate needing special accommodations or having conflicts with the course requirements for these or other reasons, please inform the instructor as soon as possible, ideally within the first two weeks of the semester. Requests for disability accommodations will require documentation through Student Disability Services.
In case of injury, illness, or family emergency that interferes with your ability to complete assignments or attend lectures, please contact the instructor as soon as possible to make alternate arrangements.

 Course overview
 This course is an introduction to the history and social study of technology. It begins with an examination of the concept of “technology” itself, which has been closely bound up with ideas of modernity, progress, expertise, and innovation since it came into wide use in the early twentieth century. It then turns to the history of industrialization since the eighteenth century, exploring the diverse factors — technical, economic, social, and cultural — that have contributed to the emergence and transformation of industrial societies. The third section of the course examines a few selected topics in depth, including the role of technology in war, environment, health, and computing, as well as the question of whether technological change can or should be controlled. The final section of the course is focused on small-group explorations of technology-related sites around Philadelphia. The course aims to strengthen your understanding of the historical roots and social contexts of contemporary technology and your skills in critically reading and writing historical and social-scientific texts.
 Assignments and grading
 Weekly responses (30%): At the beginning of most weeks during the semester (see schedule below for exceptions), you will be given a prompt related to the week’s readings and lectures. Your 100- to 200- word response is due via Canvas by Friday, 12:00pm (noon). Each response will be graded as either as not submitted (0%), unsatisfactory (70%), or satisfactory (100%). The due date is strict, and only responses submitted before the weekly deadline will receive credit. To avoid the risk of losing work-in- progress, you are encouraged to first write and edit your response in a document on your computer and then paste it into the text entry field on Canvas.
 Group field-trip presentation (15%) and individual report (15%): Two weeks toward the end of the semester will be devoted to small-group explorations of technology at sites around Philadelphia. You will be assigned to a group based on your ranking of choices from a predetermined list of sites and will visit that site together with your group at a time of your own choosing. You should plan to take at least two hours for your site visit, including travel time; you may schedule the visit at any time, as long as it takes place before your group’s scheduled meeting with the instructor to discuss your observations and ideas about the site you have visited during the week of April 10/12 (there will be no lectures on these days). Your group will deliver a short presentation during the class session on either April 17 or April 19. You will also write a short individual reflection on your group’s site visit, which is due by 12:00pm (noon) on Friday, April 20.
 Final exam (40%): The final exam will cover material from the entire semester.
 Readings
 There is one required book for the course, which is on reserve at Van Pelt Library and available for purchase at the Penn Bookstore (3601 Walnut St.). It can also be purchased as an ebook. All other readings are available as PDFs via the course’s Canvas website.

 Course website
 The course Canvas site can be found at https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1390652. Make sure that you have access to the site as soon as possible. You will need it throughout the semester to access readings, to submit assignments, to view grades and feedback, and to receive important announcements. You may want to check your Canvas settings to ensure that you are receiving notifications by email. Because technical problems sometimes occur, always double-check to be sure that your submitted assignments have been correctly uploaded.
 A note on the use of electronic devices during lectures
 Laptop computers can be a very efficient means of taking notes and searching through text, but they are also fantastically good at distracting not only their users but also those around them. You are therefore strongly encouraged to take lecture notes the old-fashioned way — that is, with a pen or pencil and paper. Precisely because it is slower and more laborious than typing for most people, writing by hand encourages you to think rather than simply to transcribe and to identify key ideas rather than getting lost in the details. If you do use a laptop to take notes in class, do not use it for social media, shopping, games, reading the news, working on assignments, or any other purposes unrelated to the lecture. Students who choose to use laptops, tablets, smartphones, or other electronic devices for such purposes — which are disruptive both to their learning and to the learning of others — will be asked to leave the classroom.
 Academic integrity and non-discrimination policy
 Although we all come to the course with different preparation, aims, and institutional positions, we are here to learn and discover together, and each of us is responsible for doing our part to create a respectful and productive classroom environment. Everyone involved with the course will be expected to abide by Penn’s Code of Academic Integrity. Because plagiarism and other violations of academic integrity undermine the learning process for the individual as well as for the broader academic community, they will result in a failing grade and possible disciplinary action. No form of harassment or discrimination on the basis of religion, race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, etc., by either the instructional staff or the students, will be tolerated. If you believe these policies are being violated or insufficiently enforced, please inform the instructor, your academic advisor, the College Office, and/or one of the other appropriate University of Pennsylvania offices (some of which are listed here).
 Special accommodations
 All appropriate efforts will be made to accommodate disability status, religious obligations, childcare and other family responsibilities, and other special needs. If you anticipate needing special accommodations or having conflicts with the course requirements for these or other reasons, please inform the instructor as soon as possible, ideally within the first two weeks of the semester. Requests for disability accommodations will require documentation through Student Disability Services.
 In case of injury, illness, or family emergency that interferes with your ability to complete assignments or attend lectures, please contact the instructor as soon as possible to make alternate arrangements.

University of Pennsylvania,STSC 160 The Information Age,https://www.sigcis.org/files/Ensmenger-STSC160syllabus-2010.pdf,Found,"We are often told that we are living in an “Information Age,” and indeed, this is a truth that seems self-evident: communications and information technologies increasingly pervade our homes, our workplaces,
our schools, even our own bodies. But what exactly do we mean when
we talk about the “Information Age”? If we are living in an Information
Age, when did it begin? What developments — social, economic, political, or technological — made it possible? How does it differ from earlier
eras? And finally, and most significantly: what does it all mean?
This course will explore the ways in Western, industrialized societies, over
the course of the previous two centuries, came to see information as a
crucial commercial, scientific, organizational, political, and commercial
asset. Although at the center of our story will be the development of
new information technologies — from printing press to telephone to
computer to Internet — our focus will not be on machines, but on people, and on the ways in which average individuals contributed to, made
sense of, and come to terms with, the many social, technological, and
political developments that have shaped the contours of our modern
Information Society. Our goal is to use these historical perspectives to
inform our discussions about issues of contemporary concern about information technology.

Course Format:
The Information Age course meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12-1:30 in the Claudia
Cohen Auditorium (G17). To the degree possible with such a large course, our meetings
will be a mixed lecture-discussion format. Our Tuesday session will typically introduce our
week’s topic; Thursday will provide further development, as well as an opportunity to talk
about the readings and answer any questions that you might have. You should have prepared the readings in advance for the Thursday session.
Attendance in the course is more than usually mandatory. Since there is no textbook for
the course, it is absolutely essential that you attend the lectures. I make extensive use
of images, audio, and video. Although I will make some of this material available on the
course Blackboard site, much of it will be available only during class. If you do need to miss
class please let me or one of the TAs know in advance.
Grading in this class will be based on four major components: two short response papers
(20%), a longer primary-source research paper (20%), an in-class mid-term (30%), and a
final exam (30%).
Required Readings:
The one required book for this course is available at the Penn Bookstore (or online):
Ensmenger, Nathan. The Computer Boys Take Over: Computers, Programmers, and the Politics of
Technical Expertise (MIT Press, 2010)
All of the other readings for this course will be made available electronically via the
course Blackboard site or will be distributed in-class.
This course fulfills the General Requirement in Sector IV: Humanities and Social Sciences.

5",,"We are often told that we are living in an “Information Age,” and indeed, this is a truth that seems self-evident: communications and information technologies increasingly pervade our homes, our workplaces,
 our schools, even our own bodies. But what exactly do we mean when
 we talk about the “Information Age”? If we are living in an Information
 Age, when did it begin? What developments — social, economic, political, or technological — made it possible? How does it differ from earlier
 eras? And finally, and most significantly: what does it all mean?
 This course will explore the ways in Western, industrialized societies, over
 the course of the previous two centuries, came to see information as a
 crucial commercial, scientific, organizational, political, and commercial
 asset. Although at the center of our story will be the development of
 new information technologies — from printing press to telephone to
 computer to Internet — our focus will not be on machines, but on people, and on the ways in which average individuals contributed to, made
 sense of, and come to terms with, the many social, technological, and
 political developments that have shaped the contours of our modern
 Information Society. Our goal is to use these historical perspectives to
 inform our discussions about issues of contemporary concern about information technology.

Course Format:
 The Information Age course meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12-1:30 in the Auditorium (G17). To the degree possible with such a large course, our meetings
 will be a mixed lecture-discussion format. Our Tuesday session will typically introduce our
 week’s topic; Thursday will provide further development, as well as an opportunity to talk
 about the readings and answer any questions that you might have. You should have prepared the readings in advance for the Thursday session.
 Attendance in the course is more than usually mandatory. Since there is no textbook for
 the course, it is absolutely essential that you attend the lectures. I make extensive use
 of images, audio, and video. Although I will make some of this material available on the
 course Blackboard site, much of it will be available only during class. If you do need to miss
 class please let me or one of the TAs know in advance.
 Grading in this class will be based on four major components: two short response papers
 (20%), a longer primary-source research paper (20%), an in-class mid-term (30%), and a
 final exam (30%).
 Required Readings:
 The one required book for this course is available at the Penn Bookstore (or online):
The Computer Boys Take Over: Computers, Programmers, and the Politics of
 Technical Expertise (MIT Press, 2010)
 All of the other readings for this course will be made available electronically via the
 course Blackboard site or will be distributed in-class.
 This course fulfills the General Requirement in Sector IV: Humanities and Social Sciences.

The idea of solving problems by collecting as much data as possible is an age-old dream that
has recently been revitalized in new forms. This course is a discussion- and research-oriented
advanced seminar in Science and Technology Studies (STS) that examines the hunger for data
from a historical, social, cultural, and political perspective. It seeks to explain when, why, and
how the collection of vast amounts of data has come to seem valuable and desirable,
sometimes in ways that seem to exceed any reasonable expectation of utility or feasibility. The
course also explores the dark sides of data hunger, from information overload to the rise of the
surveillance state and surveillance capitalism. It aims to give you a set of tools drawn from STS
for understanding how and why data dreams persist and sometimes turn into data nightmares.

This course has previously been taught as a 3-hour in-person seminar, but its format has been
modified to minimize risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. All instruction will be
conducted online via Canvas and Zoom. We will meet synchronously via Zoom during the
regularly scheduled time, but for a shortened class period, part of which will be devoted to
small-group breakout sessions. Some of the scholarly work we would have done in person
under normal circumstances will be done through annotations and responses to readings on
Canvas, as well as through a slight increase in the amount of assigned writing. You are also
strongly encouraged to take advantage of my (virtual) office hours to discussion any courserelated questions you may have.

Weekly reading annotation. Due date: each week (for weeks that have readings) by the
beginning of class
This assignment has two parts, both of which you are required to do to receive full credit:
(1) Add at least one annotation to the week’s readings on Canvas
(2) Respond to at least one annotation added by someone else.
Your annotation(s) and response(s) need not be lengthy, but they must be thoughtful. They
should explain why you found a particular passage thought-provoking, or add a new question or
alternative interpretation to someone else’s annotation. Be prepared to tell the rest of the class
about your annotations during our Zoom meeting.

Dataset presentation. Presented by one student at the beginning of class each week
Find a publicly available dataset and prepare a 10-minute presentation to the class describing
and critiquing it. Your description should provide enough detail for us to understand what the
dataset is, but your focus should be on the critique. That critique may take a variety of forms.
For instance, you could unpack the dataset’s foundational or unstated assumptions, describe its
origins and historical context(s), situate it in relation to contemporary cultural, social, or political
issues, or examine its ethical implications and tensions. In doing so, you should draw on course
readings and discussions as appropriate.
Essay #1: Conceptualizing data. Due date: Friday, September 18
Write an essay explaining what it means to say that data are rhetorical, relational, and material.
Your essay should address each of these characteristics separately but also explain how they
are related. Reference readings from Week 2 and provide some supporting examples of your
own. 600-800 words, Chicago style citations.
Essay #2: Experiencing data. Due Friday, Oct 29
Write about a meaningful personal experience you have had with data. You may use this essay
to address questions such as: How has data affected your life? How have you used data to
affect others’ lives? When has data inspired, troubled, enraged, or overwhelmed you? What are
your own data dreams and nightmares? Your essay should be written in the first person; it can
be informal but should be concrete and engaged with specific concepts, arguments, and
examples from course readings and discussions. While your essay will only be read by the
instructor (unless you choose to share it with others), please do not write anything you would
not feel comfortable sharing with the entire class. 600-800 words, Chicago style citations.
Final project proposal. Due Nov 25
The proposal should include a 300-500 word description of your plans, plus bibliography. Be
sure to explain how your project relates to the course readings and discussions, as well as what
additional sources you will need. You will have a chance to discuss your proposal with me in a
one-to-one meeting on Dec 3. Your final project can take one of two forms:
§ Option #1: A traditional scholarly essay of 1500-2000 words that critiques and
contextualizes a particular dataset. The dataset you choose may be either historical or
contemporary; it may be something we have discussed in class or something you have
found on your own. For this option, you will be expected to read scholarly works beyond
the syllabus. You may choose to write about the same dataset you presented on in class
— indeed, you are encouraged to — but expectations for the depth of research and
sophistication of analysis in this written form will be significantly higher than they are for
the in-class presentation.
§ Option #2: A hands-on project that uses text-mining, digital mapping, or other methods
to answer a question rooted in the humanities and social sciences. For this option, you
will have to identify (or generate) a dataset, apply a data analysis algorithm or algorithms
to it, and present your findings in the form of charts, maps, tables, etc. Your findings
should be accompanied by an explanatory essay of 600-800 words describing your
question, method, and conclusions, and referencing key concepts from the readings.
Final project. Due Dec 15
Two options — see details under “final project proposal” above.

Please confirm as soon as possible that you have access to the course Canvas site, and inform
me via email (ebenson@upenn.edu) if you don’t. You will need it throughout the semester to
access and annotate readings, to submit assignments, to view grades and feedback, and to
receive important announcements. You may want to check your Canvas settings to ensure that
you are receiving notifications. Always double-check to ensure that your submitted assignments
have been correctly uploaded.
……::::::.:.:……… Zoom meetings ……::….:::.:.:………:::::::::.:.:…………::….:::.:.:………::...
Our weekly meetings will take place via Zoom. They will generally last about 60-90 minutes.
You are expected, if you are able, to attend all of these meetings.
Further details:
• The mobile and web-browser-based versions of Zoom have some limitations so you
should use the desktop Zoom client on your computer to participate in class.
• Always test your speaker/headphones, microphone, and video before the beginning of
class.
• Nonverbal feedback is important for effective teaching and learning so please enable
video, but mute your audio unless you are speaking.
• If you want to speak, use the “raise hand” function and I will call on you. And be
prepared to be called on even if you do not have your hand raised.
• The chat function may be used to share web links, spell out names, etc., but should not
be used for side conversations or to pose questions or make comments. Zoom can be
distracting enough as is, so it’s best if we are all focused on the same conversation and
giving our full attention to whomever is speaking.
• Portions of these meetings will involve small-group break-out room discussions, which
will not be recorded. The portions that involve the whole class will be recorded and made
available for asynchronous review. These recordings are strictly confidential and should
not be shared beyond the class.

Each of us has a part to play in fostering a respectful and productive learning environment, and
everyone will be expected to abide by Penn’s Code of Student Conduct and Code of Academic
Integrity. Because plagiarism, cheating, and other violations of academic integrity undermine
learning for the individual as well as for the broader academic community, they may result in a
failing grade and possible disciplinary action.
No form of harassment or discrimination on the basis of religion, race, ethnicity, class, gender,
sexual orientation or identity, age, or disability will be tolerated. If you believe these policies are
being violated or insufficiently enforced, please inform the instructor, your academic advisor, the

 The idea of solving problems by collecting as much data as possible is an age-old dream that
 has recently been revitalized in new forms. This course is a discussion- and research-oriented
 advanced seminar in Science and Technology Studies (STS) that examines the hunger for data
 from a historical, social, cultural, and political perspective. It seeks to explain when, why, and
 how the collection of vast amounts of data has come to seem valuable and desirable,
 sometimes in ways that seem to exceed any reasonable expectation of utility or feasibility. The
 course also explores the dark sides of data hunger, from information overload to the rise of the
 surveillance state and surveillance capitalism. It aims to give you a set of tools drawn from STS
 for understanding how and why data dreams persist and sometimes turn into data nightmares.
 ….::::::.:.:……… COVID-19 ……..:…:………...……..:…:……..:…:…::……...……..:…:……….....
 This course has previously been taught as a 3-hour in-person seminar, but its format has been
 modified to minimize risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. All instruction will be
 conducted online via Canvas and Zoom. We will meet synchronously via Zoom during the
 regularly scheduled time, but for a shortened class period, part of which will be devoted to
 small-group breakout sessions. Some of the scholarly work we would have done in person
 under normal circumstances will be done through annotations and responses to readings on
 Canvas, as well as through a slight increase in the amount of assigned writing. You are also
 strongly encouraged to take advantage of my (virtual) office hours to discussion any courserelated questions you may have.

 Weekly reading annotation. Due date: each week (for weeks that have readings) by the
 beginning of class
 This assignment has two parts, both of which you are required to do to receive full credit:
 (1) Add at least one annotation to the week’s readings on Canvas
 (2) Respond to at least one annotation added by someone else.
 Your annotation(s) and response(s) need not be lengthy, but they must be thoughtful. They
 should explain why you found a particular passage thought-provoking, or add a new question or
 alternative interpretation to someone else’s annotation. Be prepared to tell the rest of the class
 about your annotations during our Zoom meeting.

 Dataset presentation. Presented by one student at the beginning of class each week
 Find a publicly available dataset and prepare a 10-minute presentation to the class describing
 and critiquing it. Your description should provide enough detail for us to understand what the
 dataset is, but your focus should be on the critique. That critique may take a variety of forms.
 For instance, you could unpack the dataset’s foundational or unstated assumptions, describe its
 origins and historical context(s), situate it in relation to contemporary cultural, social, or political
 issues, or examine its ethical implications and tensions. In doing so, you should draw on course
 readings and discussions as appropriate.
 Essay #1: Conceptualizing data. Due date: Friday, September 18
 Write an essay explaining what it means to say that data are rhetorical, relational, and material.
 Your essay should address each of these characteristics separately but also explain how they
 are related. Reference readings from Week 2 and provide some supporting examples of your
 own. 600-800 words, Chicago style citations.
 Essay #2: Experiencing data. Due Friday, Oct 29
 Write about a meaningful personal experience you have had with data. You may use this essay
 to address questions such as: How has data affected your life? How have you used data to
 affect others’ lives? When has data inspired, troubled, enraged, or overwhelmed you? What are
 your own data dreams and nightmares? Your essay should be written in the first person; it can
 be informal but should be concrete and engaged with specific concepts, arguments, and
 examples from course readings and discussions. While your essay will only be read by the
 instructor (unless you choose to share it with others), please do not write anything you would
 not feel comfortable sharing with the entire class. 600-800 words, Chicago style citations.
 Final project proposal. Due Nov 25
 The proposal should include a 300-500 word description of your plans, plus bibliography. Be
 sure to explain how your project relates to the course readings and discussions, as well as what
 additional sources you will need. You will have a chance to discuss your proposal with me in a
 one-to-one meeting on Dec 3. Your final project can take one of two forms:

 Dataset presentation. Presented by one student at the beginning of class each week
 Find a publicly available dataset and prepare a 10-minute presentation to the class describing
 and critiquing it. Your description should provide enough detail for us to understand what the
 dataset is, but your focus should be on the critique. That critique may take a variety of forms.
 For instance, you could unpack the dataset’s foundational or unstated assumptions, describe its
 origins and historical context(s), situate it in relation to contemporary cultural, social, or political
 issues, or examine its ethical implications and tensions. In doing so, you should draw on course
 readings and discussions as appropriate.
 Essay #1: Conceptualizing data. Due date: Friday, September 18
 Write an essay explaining what it means to say that data are rhetorical, relational, and material.
 Your essay should address each of these characteristics separately but also explain how they
 are related. Reference readings from Week 2 and provide some supporting examples of your
 own. 600-800 words, Chicago style citations.
 Essay #2: Experiencing data. Due Friday, Oct 29
 Write about a meaningful personal experience you have had with data. You may use this essay
 to address questions such as: How has data affected your life? How have you used data to
 affect others’ lives? When has data inspired, troubled, enraged, or overwhelmed you? What are
 your own data dreams and nightmares? Your essay should be written in the first person; it can
 be informal but should be concrete and engaged with specific concepts, arguments, and
 examples from course readings and discussions. While your essay will only be read by the
 instructor (unless you choose to share it with others), please do not write anything you would
 not feel comfortable sharing with the entire class. 600-800 words, Chicago style citations.
 Final project proposal. Due Nov 25
 The proposal should include a 300-500 word description of your plans, plus bibliography. Be
 sure to explain how your project relates to the course readings and discussions, as well as what
 additional sources you will need. You will have a chance to discuss your proposal with me in a
 one-to-one meeting on Dec 3. Your final project can take one of two forms:
 § Option #1: A traditional scholarly essay of 1500-2000 words that critiques and
 contextualizes a particular dataset. The dataset you choose may be either historical or
 contemporary; it may be something we have discussed in class or something you have
 found on your own. For this option, you will be expected to read scholarly works beyond
 the syllabus. You may choose to write about the same dataset you presented on in class
 — indeed, you are encouraged to — but expectations for the depth of research and
 sophistication of analysis in this written form will be significantly higher than they are for
 the in-class presentation.
 § Option #2: A hands-on project that uses text-mining, digital mapping, or other methods
 to answer a question rooted in the humanities and social sciences. For this option, you
 will have to identify (or generate) a dataset, apply a data analysis algorithm or algorithms
 to it, and present your findings in the form of charts, maps, tables, etc. Your findings
 should be accompanied by an explanatory essay of 600-800 words describing your
 question, method, and conclusions, and referencing key concepts from the readings.
 Final project. Due Dec 15
 Two options — see details under “final project proposal” above.

 Please confirm as soon as possible that you have access to the course Canvas site, and inform
 me via email if you don’t. You will need it throughout the semester to
 access and annotate readings, to submit assignments, to view grades and feedback, and to
 receive important announcements. You may want to check your Canvas settings to ensure that
 you are receiving notifications. Always double-check to ensure that your submitted assignments
 have been correctly uploaded.
 ……::::::.:.:……… Zoom meetings ……::….:::.:.:………:::::::::.:.:…………::….:::.:.:………::...
 Our weekly meetings will take place via Zoom. They will generally last about 60-90 minutes.
 You are expected, if you are able, to attend all of these meetings.
 Further details:
 • The mobile and web-browser-based versions of Zoom have some limitations so you
 should use the desktop Zoom client on your computer to participate in class.
 • Always test your speaker/headphones, microphone, and video before the beginning of
 class.
 • Nonverbal feedback is important for effective teaching and learning so please enable
 video, but mute your audio unless you are speaking.
 • If you want to speak, use the “raise hand” function and I will call on you. And be
 prepared to be called on even if you do not have your hand raised.
 • The chat function may be used to share web links, spell out names, etc., but should not
 be used for side conversations or to pose questions or make comments. Zoom can be
 distracting enough as is, so it’s best if we are all focused on the same conversation and
 giving our full attention to whomever is speaking.
 • Portions of these meetings will involve small-group break-out room discussions, which
 will not be recorded. The portions that involve the whole class will be recorded and made
 available for asynchronous review. These recordings are strictly confidential and should
 not be shared beyond the class.
 …..::::……….…:…:.:.:…… Readings ……..…..:.::..……::::…..:::::::::::::.:.:…….…..:…:……….
 All course readings and multimedia sources will be available as PDFs or web links on the
 course Canvas site.
 …..::::…:…:.:.:…… Academic integrity and non-discrimination policy ……...:::….…..:…:….
 Each of us has a part to play in fostering a respectful and productive learning environment, and
 everyone will be expected to abide by Penn’s Code of Student Conduct and Code of Academic
 Integrity. Because plagiarism, cheating, and other violations of academic integrity undermine
 learning for the individual as well as for the broader academic community, they may result in a
 failing grade and possible disciplinary action.
 No form of harassment or discrimination on the basis of religion, race, ethnicity, class, gender,
 sexual orientation or identity, age, or disability will be tolerated. If you believe these policies are
 being violated or insufficiently enforced, please inform the instructor, your academic advisor, the
 College Office, or one of the other appropriate University of Pennsylvania offices (some of which
 are listed here).

If, at any time throughout the semester, you have questions about the syllabus, please contact your instructor for clarification. Contact Instructor: Stephen C. Slota Office Hours: Virtual office hours by appointment Office: Email: (please contact me using Canvas) stephen.slota at austin.utexas.edu Discussion Leaders: Jiaying Liu; Siqi Yi, Dr. Robert Bautista; Caifan Du Office Hours: TBD Office: TBD Email: General contact procedures: Any of the instructors are happy to help you with any issues that arise. However, you are much more likely to get a direct and immediate answer on administrative questions if you start with your discussion leader. Course Goal This course will introduce students to informatics. Students will explore the foundations of the field, the core values and the concentration areas offered by the UT iSchool Informatics program. Prerequisite: none. Course Objectives Through this course students will: 2 • Gain familiarity with the foundational theories, concepts, and challenges in Cultural Heritage Informatics, Health Informatics, Human-Centered Data Science, Social Informatics, Social Justice Informatics, and User Experience Design. • Cultivate an appreciation for the importance of working in diverse and inclusive teams, serving diverse audiences, and working toward social justice and equity. • Use the iSchool’s core values as an ethical framework to analyze current events related to Informatics and formulate independent arguments. • Understand the perspectives of users and other stakeholders in informatics, including their needs, values, and preferences. • Develop basic technical proficiency in Informatics related technology. • Demonstrate written and oral communication and collaboration skills by working effectively as a part of a team while also having individual accountability. Course Materials i301 does not have a textbook or course packet. Instead, all readings will be available through Canvas, UT’s Library, or through the World Wide Web. Course Format The semester is divided into four different main topics: 1. Introduction a. The first two or three weeks of the semester we will focus on an overview of the field of informatics and its relationship to information studies. We will also explore some of the fundamental ideas related to the concept of information. 2. Core Values a. The next four weeks of the semester will focus on the core values of the UT Austin School of Information. We will discuss what these core values are and explore how to use these core values to guide our actions and reactions to real-world scenarios. 3. Concentrations a. The six weeks following the core values section will focus on each of the six different concentrations. We will explore the historical and intellectual background, as well as current events related to each concentration. The goal of this section is to help make sure each student understands all of the concentrations well enough to confidently decide which two Concentration introduction courses they will choose. 4. Wrap up a. The last few weeks will include final presentations, discussions, and a review of the semester. The two class meetings each week will normally be divided among a lecture and a discussion section, although this will vary depending on the topics and assignments we are working on. Students are expected to attend each session on Tuesday and Thursday of each week. As part of a semester-long group project, students will work in a small group to apply their understanding of the core values and one of the concentrations to propose a solution to a realworld problem or dilemma. Groups will choose a relevant current event to use as their problem or dilemma and develop a proposal and oral presentation to address that problem using the four core values as a lens. More details on the final project are available below. 3 Grading Policy 301 uses the traditional UT Austin undergraduate grading scale: A 94 – 100 A - 90 - 93 B + 87 - 89 B 83 - 86 B - 80 - 82 C + 77 - 79 C 73 - 76 C - 70 - 72 D+ 67 – 69 D 63 - 66 D- 60 - 62 (minimum for pass/fail students to pass) F Below 60 The different assignments throughout the semester are weighted as described below: 1. Attendance/class participation 20% 2. Discussion questions 20% 3. Module quizzes 10% 4. Core values assignment 10% 5. Final assignment – individual essay 10% 6. Final assignment – peer review 10% 7. Final assignment – group essay 10% 8. Final assignment – group presentation 10% Each of the Final Assignment projects must be satisfactorily completed in order to pass the class. Grades for essays, quizzes, participation, and weekly discussions will be posted in Canvas. It usually takes us one week to finish grading each assignment that was submitted by the deadline, with larger assignments graded within two weeks, so you should be able to keep up with your grade on a regular basis. If you have any questions about your grades at any point, definitely let your instructor(s) know! Late Grading: Late assignments will not be accepted unless the instructor approves the late submission ahead of time. If you become ill or experience some kind of emergency, please let the instructor know asap. Once the due date for an assignment has passed, it is more difficult for us to excuse late assignments, but we definitely want to know if something is going on so we can work with you to make sure you succeed in the class! Assignments Attendance/Participation Positive, thoughtful, and active participation in the discussion sections and at times during the main lecture, is strongly encouraged. Your lived experience, questions, ideas, and 4 even your confusion are valuable contributions to the class and will help make the course more interesting and valuable for everyone! Attendance and participation go hand in hand; it isn’t enough to just be physically (or virtually!) present, we ask that you also show up having read and thought about the materials for the week and how they relate to your own personal experience and the previous topics covered in class. Ideally you will be able to attend class every week, but we understand that life can get in the way, especially during a pandemic. Each student is allowed two missed classes without consequence; you can miss a lecture and discussion section one week, for example, or two different lectures throughout the semester, without your participation grade being negatively affected. We would really appreciate knowing ahead of time, if possible, that you will not be able to attend class. If it isn’t possible to notify us ahead of time, we would love to know afterward just to make sure that you are alright. If you miss more than two classes your participation grade will drop by one grade level for each missed class. For example, if you miss 3 classes, the highest participation grade you will be able to achieve is a B, and that assumes that every day you attend class you are actively engaged and making valuable contributions. If you need to miss more than two classes for medical reasons, we will need a doctor’s note and you should definitely get in touch with us to talk through how we might limit the impact of missing class on your semester grade. Discussion Questions Each week students will prepare and submit to Canvas a discussion question about the assigned reading for that week. Discussion questions are due in Canvas by the beginning of the Tuesday lecture class at 2:00 PM. Late discussion questions will not be accepted. The discussion question should be focused on one or more of the required readings, at least 75 words long for each reading, and should make it clear that you have both read and thought about the assigned material. Your instructor will select a few of the discussion questions to guide the discussion of the week’s readings in the Thursday discussion section. We will not have time to discuss a submission from each student during each class. Discussion questions are an opportunity for you to bring your own particular point of view and interests to the material we cover in class, and students are encouraged to connect the material to current events and prior learning both in this class and other courses you may have taken. Discussion questions should be conversation starters. It might help for you to look for an idea or assertion in the reading that you found interesting and would like to talk to your peers about in class. Discussion questions are not “answerable”, if your question has a correct answer, it probably isn’t a good discussion question! Module Quizzes A weekly review quiz covering the lecture materials and readings will be available through Canvas. The quiz will become available after that week’s lecture (Tuesday at 3:30) and will be due before the beginning of the next week’s lecture (the following Tuesday at 2:00). The quizzes are meant as a review and are open book, but we expect you to take them on your own, without collaborating with others. The top ten (out of twelve total) scores a student receives on these quizzes will be counted toward the student’s final grade in the course, the other scores will be dropped. Core Values Assignment 5 During the first half of the semester, students will work in small groups to apply each of the four core values to a dilemma or real-world problem. Students will work together in class to discuss the core value for the week, find and discuss relevant dilemmas, and determine appropriate solutions to propose to those dilemmas. During the final core value discussion section, students will have time to develop a presentation that will convince the leader of an organization related to the dilemma (this may be the CEO or President of the company, for example), to take action that is consistent with all four core values discussed in class. Students will present their pitch during the discussion section. A few outstanding student groups may be asked to present in front of the larger class. Final Assignment The final assignment for the class is designed to build on the skills learned in the core values assignment above, to develop an independent written discussion of the application of one of the core values to a dilemma, and to work as part of a group to develop a larger written assignment and group presentation. As part of this assignment, students will work together in small groups to analyze an open-ended dilemma in one of the six different concentrations. Students will first rank the six different concentrations based on their level of interest. The instructor will use this ranking to create groups of three to four students who will work to develop four graded deliverables: 1. An individual student paper that analyzes the dilemma using one of the four core values as a lens. Each student will choose a different core value and write a paper of between 1,500 and 2,500 words in length analyzing the dilemma using the lens of that core value. 2. A peer review of the individual papers written by the other members of your group. This is a great way to make sure you are familiar with the work of your group members and to start to think about how you might combine your work into a single, holistic document. 3. A group paper that combines each of the individual papers into one complete and coordinated paper. This group paper should be more than just a copy and paste version of the different individual papers, it should bring together the three to four different points of view into one, coordinated recommendation for action to the CEO or president of the company. This paper should be between 2,000 and 3,000 words long. 4. A three-to-five-minute group presentation to the class based on the combined paper that is meant to convince the CEO to take the recommended action. As the foundation for this exercise, the group will find a moral dilemma, with the guidance of the instructor, that is relevant to their concentration. The group will then use that dilemma as the foundation for the four assignments mentioned earlier. The schedule for this assignment: 1. Week 6 – 9/30 a. Students select a Concentration and form Final Project Groups. 2. Week 8 – 10/14 a. Each group will select a dilemma to use as the foundation for their project 3. Week 10 – 10/28 a. Individual essays due. These essays apply one of the core values lenses to the dilemma. 6 4. Week 11 – 11/4 a. Peer review due. Students will review the individual essays of the three other members of their group. 5. Week 12 a. Students receive individual grades and feedback on their individual essay. 6. Week 13 – 11/17 a. Students present pitch to the CEO during discussion group 7. Week 14 – 12/2 a. Students submit final paper that combines each of the individual papers into one synthesized final report. Schedule The preliminary schedule for the major assignments for this semester is listed below.

Copying someone else’s work, buying a paper and submitting it as your own, copying and pasting text (even with changes), or borrowing images from an online source, are some examples of plagiarism. Even if you plagiarize accidentally, you can be held responsible and penalized. Learning to cite sources appropriately is an important part of becoming a professional. When you are unsure about citation, you are encouraged to ask your instructor (who is already an expert in the discipline) what is appropriate in the context of your assignment. Consultants at The University Writing Center can also help you determine whether you are citing sources correctly—and they have helpful guides online for using direct quotations and paraphrasing. Reviewing those skills will help you feel confident that you are handling sources professionally in your writing. You can read the University’s definition of plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty in Sec. 11–402 of the Student Conduct Code. For more information, visit the Dean of Students’ site. Anti-Oppression I have worked hard over the past summer to completely revamp this course to be antiracist and anti-sexist. It is a work in progress. Among other resources, I have focused and relied heavily on this collection I have put together: https://utexas.app.box.com/folder/115692784945?s=uzohfuct8dpze5gojkkp4e4fffse51k2 I am excited to take what I consider to be an important step forward in this thinking; not just focusing on “inclusivity”, but on actively fighting against racism and sexism in my personal and professional life. I share this to let you know that the class will not be perfect; I ask for your patience, generosity, and thoughtful feedback throughout the semester. In return, I will strive to show the same patience, generosity, and thoughtfulness toward the class and each individual student. Respectful Conversations Below is a list of guidelines to keep in mind as we have conversations in class. These guidelines will help us have conversations around difficult or challenging ideas, while remaining respectful of one another and allowing for open dialogue: • Be intentional about your language. Think about the language you are using, not just in terms of intent, but also in terms of impact. If someone says something you hear as offensive, consider that they may not realize they have said something hurtful. If someone calls you out for saying something offensive, remember that your intent can be different than your impact. Ask yourself, before you engage, if your words will effect change, understanding, and empathy. • Respectfully challenge the idea, not the person. Focus on the facts or ideas you want to communicate, without attacking the person. • Don’t make assumptions. When you’re unsure about something someone has said, ask for clarification and be willing to listen to the response. 14 • Encourage understanding. If you are part of a discussion that has become harmful or offensive, do your part to encourage empathy and understanding. • Avoid generalizing or over-simplifying. Being too general may overshadow the heart of the matter and appear as insensitive. • Use facts graciously, not to shut down a conversation. Remind people that this is a conversation. Everyone’s personal experience matters. Recommend that people share information to deepen the discussion, not to shut down the conversation • Do not tokenize people. Individuals can only speak to their own experiences. Do not look to others to speak on behalf of their race, gender, ethnicity, or other groups they may identify as being a part of. • Acknowledge common ground. Even if you don’t wholeheartedly agree with someone, if you can appreciate something they’ve said or done, let them know. • Call people “in” not “out”. When you are holding someone accountable for an offensive or ignorant statement, think about how to address the hurt they caused and still engage them in the conversation. Resources Style Manuals Students will need to cite all sources for their essays in APA format. Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL) offers a great overview on how to do this: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl Style manuals are located under Research and Citation. University Policies Religious or Holy Day Observance ""A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.” (http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi04-05/ch4/ch4g.html) Email “Electronic mail (e-mail), like postal mail, is a mechanism for official University communication to students. The University will exercise the right to send e-mail communications to all students, and the University will expect that e-mail communications will be received and read in a timely manner.” (http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi04-05/app/appn.html). I will reply to student emails within 24 hours on weekdays and 48 hours on weekends barring a rare and extenuating circumstance. Personal Pronouns 15 Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center (http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-andresources/). I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns. More resources are available on the Gender and Sexuality Center’s website, www.utgsc.org. University Resources for Students Services for Students with Disabilities The university is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive learning environment consistent with university policy and federal and state law.

LAND ACKNOWLEDGMENT As the flagship institution in our state university system, it is important that The University of Texas at Austin demonstrate respect for the historic and contemporary presence of Indigenous Peoples in Texas and, particularly, in the greater Austin area. To that end, it is incumbent upon The University of Texas at Austin to recognize that our campus resides on what were historically the traditional territories of Indigenous Peoples who were dispossessed of their homelands. Land Acknowledgements are an expression of gratitude and appreciation to the Indigenous Peoples, the traditional caretakers of the land, for the use of their lands on which we work, study, and learn. Land Acknowledgment I would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on Indigenous land. Moreover, I would like to acknowledge and pay our respects to the Carrizo & Comecrudo, Coahuiltecan, Caddo, Tonkawa, Comanche, Lipan Apache, Alabama-Coushatta, Kickapoo, Tigua Pueblo, and all the American Indian and Indigenous Peoples and communities who have been or have become a part of these lands and territories in Texas, here on Turtle Island. 17 To learn more, you can visit this Tribal Land Map and review 10 Ways to be a Genuine Ally to Indigenous Communities, by Amnesty International.

The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/ Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside. • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building. • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office. • Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at: • www.utexas.edu/emergency Title IX Reporting Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature occurs in our community, the university can: 1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating. 2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation. 3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies. Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, report any information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas 18 law requires that all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making an official report to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-0419. Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer to as unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, including the types of conduct covered under Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to support survivors. University Policies Academic Integrity Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT.

Course Goal This course will introduce students to informatics. Students will explore the foundations of the field, the core values and the concentration areas offered by the UT iSchool Informatics program. Prerequisite: none. Course Objectives Through this course students will: 2 • Gain familiarity with the foundational theories, concepts, and challenges in Cultural Heritage Informatics, Health Informatics, Human-Centered Data Science, Social Informatics, Social Justice Informatics, and User Experience Design. • Cultivate an appreciation for the importance of working in diverse and inclusive teams, serving diverse audiences, and working toward social justice and equity. • Use the iSchool’s core values as an ethical framework to analyze current events related to Informatics and formulate independent arguments. • Understand the perspectives of users and other stakeholders in informatics, including their needs, values, and preferences. • Develop basic technical proficiency in Informatics related technology. • Demonstrate written and oral communication and collaboration skills by working effectively as a part of a team while also having individual accountability. Course Materials i301 does not have a textbook or course packet. Instead, all readings will be available through Canvas, UT’s Library, or through the World Wide Web. Course Format The semester is divided into four different main topics: 1. Introduction a. The first two or three weeks of the semester we will focus on an overview of the field of informatics and its relationship to information studies. We will also explore some of the fundamental ideas related to the concept of information. 2. Core Values a. The next four weeks of the semester will focus on the core values of the UT Austin School of Information. We will discuss what these core values are and explore how to use these core values to guide our actions and reactions to real-world scenarios. 3. Concentrations a. The six weeks following the core values section will focus on each of the six different concentrations. We will explore the historical and intellectual background, as well as current events related to each concentration. The goal of this section is to help make sure each student understands all of the concentrations well enough to confidently decide which two Concentration introduction courses they will choose. 4. Wrap up a. The last few weeks will include final presentations, discussions, and a review of the semester. The two class meetings each week will normally be divided among a lecture and a discussion section, although this will vary depending on the topics and assignments we are working on. Students are expected to attend each session on Tuesday and Thursday of each week. As part of a semester-long group project, students will work in a small group to apply their understanding of the core values and one of the concentrations to propose a solution to a realworld problem or dilemma. Groups will choose a relevant current event to use as their problem or dilemma and develop a proposal and oral presentation to address that problem using the four core values as a lens. More details on the final project are available below. 3 Grading Policy 301 uses the traditional UT Austin undergraduate grading scale: A 94 – 100 A - 90 - 93 B + 87 - 89 B 83 - 86 B - 80 - 82 C + 77 - 79 C 73 - 76 C - 70 - 72 D+ 67 – 69 D 63 - 66 D- 60 - 62 (minimum for pass/fail students to pass) F Below 60 The different assignments throughout the semester are weighted as described below: 1. Attendance/class participation 20% 2. Discussion questions 20% 3. Module quizzes 10% 4. Core values assignment 10% 5. Final assignment – individual essay 10% 6. Final assignment – peer review 10% 7. Final assignment – group essay 10% 8. Final assignment – group presentation 10% Each of the Final Assignment projects must be satisfactorily completed in order to pass the class. Grades for essays, quizzes, participation, and weekly discussions will be posted in Canvas. It usually takes us one week to finish grading each assignment that was submitted by the deadline, with larger assignments graded within two weeks, so you should be able to keep up with your grade on a regular basis. If you have any questions about your grades at any point, definitely let your instructor(s) know! Late Grading: Late assignments will not be accepted unless the instructor approves the late submission ahead of time. If you become ill or experience some kind of emergency, please let the instructor know asap. Once the due date for an assignment has passed, it is more difficult for us to excuse late assignments, but we definitely want to know if something is going on so we can work with you to make sure you succeed in the class! Assignments Attendance/Participation Positive, thoughtful, and active participation in the discussion sections and at times during the main lecture, is strongly encouraged. Your lived experience, questions, ideas, and 4 even your confusion are valuable contributions to the class and will help make the course more interesting and valuable for everyone! Attendance and participation go hand in hand; it isn’t enough to just be physically (or virtually!) present, we ask that you also show up having read and thought about the materials for the week and how they relate to your own personal experience and the previous topics covered in class. Ideally you will be able to attend class every week, but we understand that life can get in the way, especially during a pandemic. Each student is allowed two missed classes without consequence; you can miss a lecture and discussion section one week, for example, or two different lectures throughout the semester, without your participation grade being negatively affected. We would really appreciate knowing ahead of time, if possible, that you will not be able to attend class. If it isn’t possible to notify us ahead of time, we would love to know afterward just to make sure that you are alright. If you miss more than two classes your participation grade will drop by one grade level for each missed class. For example, if you miss 3 classes, the highest participation grade you will be able to achieve is a B, and that assumes that every day you attend class you are actively engaged and making valuable contributions. If you need to miss more than two classes for medical reasons, we will need a doctor’s note and you should definitely get in touch with us to talk through how we might limit the impact of missing class on your semester grade. Discussion Questions Each week students will prepare and submit to Canvas a discussion question about the assigned reading for that week. Discussion questions are due in Canvas by the beginning of the Tuesday lecture class at 2:00 PM. Late discussion questions will not be accepted. The discussion question should be focused on one or more of the required readings, at least 75 words long for each reading, and should make it clear that you have both read and thought about the assigned material. Your instructor will select a few of the discussion questions to guide the discussion of the week’s readings in the Thursday discussion section. We will not have time to discuss a submission from each student during each class. Discussion questions are an opportunity for you to bring your own particular point of view and interests to the material we cover in class, and students are encouraged to connect the material to current events and prior learning both in this class and other courses you may have taken. Discussion questions should be conversation starters. It might help for you to look for an idea or assertion in the reading that you found interesting and would like to talk to your peers about in class. Discussion questions are not “answerable”, if your question has a correct answer, it probably isn’t a good discussion question! Module Quizzes A weekly review quiz covering the lecture materials and readings will be available through Canvas. The quiz will become available after that week’s lecture (Tuesday at 3:30) and will be due before the beginning of the next week’s lecture (the following Tuesday at 2:00). The quizzes are meant as a review and are open book, but we expect you to take them on your own, without collaborating with others. The top ten (out of twelve total) scores a student receives on these quizzes will be counted toward the student’s final grade in the course, the other scores will be dropped. Core Values Assignment 5 During the first half of the semester, students will work in small groups to apply each of the four core values to a dilemma or real-world problem. Students will work together in class to discuss the core value for the week, find and discuss relevant dilemmas, and determine appropriate solutions to propose to those dilemmas. During the final core value discussion section, students will have time to develop a presentation that will convince the leader of an organization related to the dilemma (this may be the CEO or President of the company, for example), to take action that is consistent with all four core values discussed in class. Students will present their pitch during the discussion section. A few outstanding student groups may be asked to present in front of the larger class. Final Assignment The final assignment for the class is designed to build on the skills learned in the core values assignment above, to develop an independent written discussion of the application of one of the core values to a dilemma, and to work as part of a group to develop a larger written assignment and group presentation. As part of this assignment, students will work together in small groups to analyze an open-ended dilemma in one of the six different concentrations. Students will first rank the six different concentrations based on their level of interest. The instructor will use this ranking to create groups of three to four students who will work to develop four graded deliverables: 1. An individual student paper that analyzes the dilemma using one of the four core values as a lens. Each student will choose a different core value and write a paper of between 1,500 and 2,500 words in length analyzing the dilemma using the lens of that core value. 2. A peer review of the individual papers written by the other members of your group. This is a great way to make sure you are familiar with the work of your group members and to start to think about how you might combine your work into a single, holistic document. 3. A group paper that combines each of the individual papers into one complete and coordinated paper. This group paper should be more than just a copy and paste version of the different individual papers, it should bring together the three to four different points of view into one, coordinated recommendation for action to the CEO or president of the company. This paper should be between 2,000 and 3,000 words long. 4. A three-to-five-minute group presentation to the class based on the combined paper that is meant to convince the CEO to take the recommended action. As the foundation for this exercise, the group will find a moral dilemma, with the guidance of the instructor, that is relevant to their concentration. The group will then use that dilemma as the foundation for the four assignments mentioned earlier. The schedule for this assignment: 1. Week 6 – 9/30 a. Students select a Concentration and form Final Project Groups. 2. Week 8 – 10/14 a. Each group will select a dilemma to use as the foundation for their project 3. Week 10 – 10/28 a. Individual essays due. These essays apply one of the core values lenses to the dilemma. 6 4. Week 11 – 11/4 a. Peer review due. Students will review the individual essays of the three other members of their group. 5. Week 12 a. Students receive individual grades and feedback on their individual essay. 6. Week 13 – 11/17 a. Students present pitch to the CEO during discussion group 7. Week 14 – 12/2 a. Students submit final paper that combines each of the individual papers into one synthesized final report. Schedule The preliminary schedule for the major assignments for this semester is listed below. Each of these assignments and due dates will be discussed in class during the semester, but this schedule is offered as a guide to help you plan your workload throughout the semester: 9/30 Select Concentrations and Form Groups for Final Project 10/6 Core Values Pitch to CEO 10/14 Submit Dilemma to Canvas 10/28 Individual Dilemma Essay 11/4 Peer Review 11/18 CEO pitch 12/2 Final Paper Due Introduction Date Meeting Agenda Due Week 1 - Introduction 8/23 Lecture Course Introduction Review Syllabus 8/25 Discussion Section Welcome Introductions Nothing due Week 2 – What is Information?

Copying someone else’s work, buying a paper and submitting it as your own, copying and pasting text (even with changes), or borrowing images from an online source, are some examples of plagiarism. Even if you plagiarize accidentally, you can be held responsible and penalized. Learning to cite sources appropriately is an important part of becoming a professional. When you are unsure about citation, you are encouraged to ask your instructor (who is already an expert in the discipline) what is appropriate in the context of your assignment. Consultants at The University Writing Center can also help you determine whether you are citing sources correctly—and they have helpful guides online for using direct quotations and paraphrasing. Reviewing those skills will help you feel confident that you are handling sources professionally in your writing. You can read the University’s definition of plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty in Sec. 11–402 of the Student Conduct Code. For more information, visit the Dean of Students’ site. Anti-Oppression I have worked hard over the past summer to completely revamp this course to be antiracist and anti-sexist. It is a work in progress. Among other resources, I have focused and relied heavily on this collection I have put together: https://utexas.app.box.com/folder/115692784945?s=uzohfuct8dpze5gojkkp4e4fffse51k2 I am excited to take what I consider to be an important step forward in this thinking; not just focusing on “inclusivity”, but on actively fighting against racism and sexism in my personal and professional life. I share this to let you know that the class will not be perfect; I ask for your patience, generosity, and thoughtful feedback throughout the semester. In return, I will strive to show the same patience, generosity, and thoughtfulness toward the class and each individual student. Respectful Conversations Below is a list of guidelines to keep in mind as we have conversations in class. These guidelines will help us have conversations around difficult or challenging ideas, while remaining respectful of one another and allowing for open dialogue: • Be intentional about your language. Think about the language you are using, not just in terms of intent, but also in terms of impact. If someone says something you hear as offensive, consider that they may not realize they have said something hurtful. If someone calls you out for saying something offensive, remember that your intent can be different than your impact. Ask yourself, before you engage, if your words will effect change, understanding, and empathy. • Respectfully challenge the idea, not the person. Focus on the facts or ideas you want to communicate, without attacking the person. • Don’t make assumptions. When you’re unsure about something someone has said, ask for clarification and be willing to listen to the response. 14 • Encourage understanding. If you are part of a discussion that has become harmful or offensive, do your part to encourage empathy and understanding. • Avoid generalizing or over-simplifying. Being too general may overshadow the heart of the matter and appear as insensitive. • Use facts graciously, not to shut down a conversation. Remind people that this is a conversation. Everyone’s personal experience matters. Recommend that people share information to deepen the discussion, not to shut down the conversation • Do not tokenize people. Individuals can only speak to their own experiences. Do not look to others to speak on behalf of their race, gender, ethnicity, or other groups they may identify as being a part of. • Acknowledge common ground. Even if you don’t wholeheartedly agree with someone, if you can appreciate something they’ve said or done, let them know. • Call people “in” not “out”. When you are holding someone accountable for an offensive or ignorant statement, think about how to address the hurt they caused and still engage them in the conversation. Resources Style Manuals Students will need to cite all sources for their essays in APA format. Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL) offers a great overview on how to do this: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl Style manuals are located under Research and Citation. University Policies Religious or Holy Day Observance ""A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.” (http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi04-05/ch4/ch4g.html) Email “Electronic mail (e-mail), like postal mail, is a mechanism for official University communication to students. The University will exercise the right to send e-mail communications to all students, and the University will expect that e-mail communications will be received and read in a timely manner.” (http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi04-05/app/appn.html). I will reply to student emails within 24 hours on weekdays and 48 hours on weekends barring a rare and extenuating circumstance. Personal Pronouns 15 Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center (http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-andresources/). I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns. More resources are available on the Gender and Sexuality Center’s website, www.utgsc.org.

Course Goal This course will introduce students to informatics. Students will explore the foundations of the field, the core values and the concentration areas offered by the UT iSchool Informatics program. Prerequisite: none. Course Objectives Through this course students will: 2 • Gain familiarity with the foundational theories, concepts, and challenges in Cultural Heritage Informatics, Health Informatics, Human-Centered Data Science, Social Informatics, Social Justice Informatics, and User Experience Design. • Cultivate an appreciation for the importance of working in diverse and inclusive teams, serving diverse audiences, and working toward social justice and equity. • Use the iSchool’s core values as an ethical framework to analyze current events related to Informatics and formulate independent arguments. • Understand the perspectives of users and other stakeholders in informatics, including their needs, values, and preferences. • Develop basic technical proficiency in Informatics related technology. • Demonstrate written and oral communication and collaboration skills by working effectively as a part of a team while also having individual accountability. Course Materials i301 does not have a textbook or course packet. Instead, all readings will be available through Canvas, UT’s Library, or through the World Wide Web. Course Format The semester is divided into four different main topics: 1. Introduction a. The first two or three weeks of the semester we will focus on an overview of the field of informatics and its relationship to information studies. We will also explore some of the fundamental ideas related to the concept of information. 2. Core Values a. The next four weeks of the semester will focus on the core values of the UT Austin School of Information. We will discuss what these core values are and explore how to use these core values to guide our actions and reactions to real-world scenarios. 3. Concentrations a. The six weeks following the core values section will focus on each of the six different concentrations. We will explore the historical and intellectual background, as well as current events related to each concentration. The goal of this section is to help make sure each student understands all of the concentrations well enough to confidently decide which two Concentration introduction courses they will choose. 4. Wrap up a. The last few weeks will include final presentations, discussions, and a review of the semester. The two class meetings each week will normally be divided among a lecture and a discussion section, although this will vary depending on the topics and assignments we are working on. Students are expected to attend each session on Tuesday and Thursday of each week. As part of a semester-long group project, students will work in a small group to apply their understanding of the core values and one of the concentrations to propose a solution to a realworld problem or dilemma. Groups will choose a relevant current event to use as their problem or dilemma and develop a proposal and oral presentation to address that problem using the four core values as a lens. More details on the final project are available below. 3 Grading Policy 301 uses the traditional UT Austin undergraduate grading scale: A 94 – 100 A - 90 - 93 B + 87 - 89 B 83 - 86 B - 80 - 82 C + 77 - 79 C 73 - 76 C - 70 - 72 D+ 67 – 69 D 63 - 66 D- 60 - 62 (minimum for pass/fail students to pass) F Below 60 The different assignments throughout the semester are weighted as described below: 1. Attendance/class participation 20% 2. Discussion questions 20% 3. Module quizzes 10% 4. Core values assignment 10% 5. Final assignment – individual essay 10% 6. Final assignment – peer review 10% 7. Final assignment – group essay 10% 8. Final assignment – group presentation 10% Each of the Final Assignment projects must be satisfactorily completed in order to pass the class. Grades for essays, quizzes, participation, and weekly discussions will be posted in Canvas. It usually takes us one week to finish grading each assignment that was submitted by the deadline, with larger assignments graded within two weeks, so you should be able to keep up with your grade on a regular basis. If you have any questions about your grades at any point, definitely let your instructor(s) know! Late Grading: Late assignments will not be accepted unless the instructor approves the late submission ahead of time. If you become ill or experience some kind of emergency, please let the instructor know asap. Once the due date for an assignment has passed, it is more difficult for us to excuse late assignments, but we definitely want to know if something is going on so we can work with you to make sure you succeed in the class! Assignments Attendance/Participation Positive, thoughtful, and active participation in the discussion sections and at times during the main lecture, is strongly encouraged. Your lived experience, questions, ideas, and 4 even your confusion are valuable contributions to the class and will help make the course more interesting and valuable for everyone! Attendance and participation go hand in hand; it isn’t enough to just be physically (or virtually!) present, we ask that you also show up having read and thought about the materials for the week and how they relate to your own personal experience and the previous topics covered in class. Ideally you will be able to attend class every week, but we understand that life can get in the way, especially during a pandemic. Each student is allowed two missed classes without consequence; you can miss a lecture and discussion section one week, for example, or two different lectures throughout the semester, without your participation grade being negatively affected. We would really appreciate knowing ahead of time, if possible, that you will not be able to attend class. If it isn’t possible to notify us ahead of time, we would love to know afterward just to make sure that you are alright. If you miss more than two classes your participation grade will drop by one grade level for each missed class. For example, if you miss 3 classes, the highest participation grade you will be able to achieve is a B, and that assumes that every day you attend class you are actively engaged and making valuable contributions. If you need to miss more than two classes for medical reasons, we will need a doctor’s note and you should definitely get in touch with us to talk through how we might limit the impact of missing class on your semester grade. Discussion Questions Each week students will prepare and submit to Canvas a discussion question about the assigned reading for that week. Discussion questions are due in Canvas by the beginning of the Tuesday lecture class at 2:00 PM. Late discussion questions will not be accepted. The discussion question should be focused on one or more of the required readings, at least 75 words long for each reading, and should make it clear that you have both read and thought about the assigned material. Your instructor will select a few of the discussion questions to guide the discussion of the week’s readings in the Thursday discussion section. We will not have time to discuss a submission from each student during each class. Discussion questions are an opportunity for you to bring your own particular point of view and interests to the material we cover in class, and students are encouraged to connect the material to current events and prior learning both in this class and other courses you may have taken. Discussion questions should be conversation starters. It might help for you to look for an idea or assertion in the reading that you found interesting and would like to talk to your peers about in class. Discussion questions are not “answerable”, if your question has a correct answer, it probably isn’t a good discussion question! Module Quizzes A weekly review quiz covering the lecture materials and readings will be available through Canvas. The quiz will become available after that week’s lecture (Tuesday at 3:30) and will be due before the beginning of the next week’s lecture (the following Tuesday at 2:00). The quizzes are meant as a review and are open book, but we expect you to take them on your own, without collaborating with others. The top ten (out of twelve total) scores a student receives on these quizzes will be counted toward the student’s final grade in the course, the other scores will be dropped. Core Values Assignment 5 During the first half of the semester, students will work in small groups to apply each of the four core values to a dilemma or real-world problem. Students will work together in class to discuss the core value for the week, find and discuss relevant dilemmas, and determine appropriate solutions to propose to those dilemmas. During the final core value discussion section, students will have time to develop a presentation that will convince the leader of an organization related to the dilemma (this may be the CEO or President of the company, for example), to take action that is consistent with all four core values discussed in class. Students will present their pitch during the discussion section. A few outstanding student groups may be asked to present in front of the larger class. Final Assignment The final assignment for the class is designed to build on the skills learned in the core values assignment above, to develop an independent written discussion of the application of one of the core values to a dilemma, and to work as part of a group to develop a larger written assignment and group presentation. As part of this assignment, students will work together in small groups to analyze an open-ended dilemma in one of the six different concentrations. Students will first rank the six different concentrations based on their level of interest. The instructor will use this ranking to create groups of three to four students who will work to develop four graded deliverables: 1. An individual student paper that analyzes the dilemma using one of the four core values as a lens. Each student will choose a different core value and write a paper of between 1,500 and 2,500 words in length analyzing the dilemma using the lens of that core value. 2. A peer review of the individual papers written by the other members of your group. This is a great way to make sure you are familiar with the work of your group members and to start to think about how you might combine your work into a single, holistic document. 3. A group paper that combines each of the individual papers into one complete and coordinated paper. This group paper should be more than just a copy and paste version of the different individual papers, it should bring together the three to four different points of view into one, coordinated recommendation for action to the CEO or president of the company. This paper should be between 2,000 and 3,000 words long. 4. A three-to-five-minute group presentation to the class based on the combined paper that is meant to convince the CEO to take the recommended action. As the foundation for this exercise, the group will find a moral dilemma, with the guidance of the instructor, that is relevant to their concentration. The group will then use that dilemma as the foundation for the four assignments mentioned earlier. The schedule for this assignment: 1. Week 6 – 9/30 a. Students select a Concentration and form Final Project Groups. 2. Week 8 – 10/14 a. Each group will select a dilemma to use as the foundation for their project 3. Week 10 – 10/28 a. Individual essays due. These essays apply one of the core values lenses to the dilemma. 6 4. Week 11 – 11/4 a. Peer review due. Students will review the individual essays of the three other members of their group. 5. Week 12 a. Students receive individual grades and feedback on their individual essay. 6. Week 13 – 11/17 a. Students present pitch to the CEO during discussion group 7. Week 14 – 12/2 a. Students submit final paper that combines each of the individual papers into one synthesized final report. Schedule The preliminary schedule for the major assignments for this semester is listed below. Each of these assignments and due dates will be discussed in class during the semester, but this schedule is offered as a guide to help you plan your workload throughout the semester: 9/30 Select Concentrations and Form Groups for Final Project 10/6 Core Values Pitch to CEO 10/14 Submit Dilemma to Canvas 10/28 Individual Dilemma Essay 11/4 Peer Review 11/18 CEO pitch 12/2 Final Paper Due Introduction Date Meeting Agenda Due Week 1 - Introduction 8/23 Lecture Course Introduction Review Syllabus 8/25 Discussion Section Welcome Introductions Nothing due Week 2 – What is Information?

Copying someone else’s work, buying a paper and submitting it as your own, copying and pasting text (even with changes), or borrowing images from an online source, are some examples of plagiarism. Even if you plagiarize accidentally, you can be held responsible and penalized. Learning to cite sources appropriately is an important part of becoming a professional. When you are unsure about citation, you are encouraged to ask your instructor (who is already an expert in the discipline) what is appropriate in the context of your assignment. Consultants at The University Writing Center can also help you determine whether you are citing sources correctly—and they have helpful guides online for using direct quotations and paraphrasing. Reviewing those skills will help you feel confident that you are handling sources professionally in your writing. You can read the University’s definition of plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty in Sec. 11–402 of the Student Conduct Code. For more information, visit the Dean of Students’ site. Anti-Oppression I have worked hard over the past summer to completely revamp this course to be antiracist and anti-sexist. It is a work in progress. Among other resources, I have focused and relied heavily on this collection I have put together: https://utexas.app.box.com/folder/115692784945?s=uzohfuct8dpze5gojkkp4e4fffse51k2 I am excited to take what I consider to be an important step forward in this thinking; not just focusing on “inclusivity”, but on actively fighting against racism and sexism in my personal and professional life. I share this to let you know that the class will not be perfect; I ask for your patience, generosity, and thoughtful feedback throughout the semester. In return, I will strive to show the same patience, generosity, and thoughtfulness toward the class and each individual student. Respectful Conversations Below is a list of guidelines to keep in mind as we have conversations in class. These guidelines will help us have conversations around difficult or challenging ideas, while remaining respectful of one another and allowing for open dialogue: • Be intentional about your language. Think about the language you are using, not just in terms of intent, but also in terms of impact. If someone says something you hear as offensive, consider that they may not realize they have said something hurtful. If someone calls you out for saying something offensive, remember that your intent can be different than your impact. Ask yourself, before you engage, if your words will effect change, understanding, and empathy. • Respectfully challenge the idea, not the person. Focus on the facts or ideas you want to communicate, without attacking the person. • Don’t make assumptions. When you’re unsure about something someone has said, ask for clarification and be willing to listen to the response. 14 • Encourage understanding. If you are part of a discussion that has become harmful or offensive, do your part to encourage empathy and understanding. • Avoid generalizing or over-simplifying. Being too general may overshadow the heart of the matter and appear as insensitive. • Use facts graciously, not to shut down a conversation. Remind people that this is a conversation. Everyone’s personal experience matters. Recommend that people share information to deepen the discussion, not to shut down the conversation • Do not tokenize people. Individuals can only speak to their own experiences. Do not look to others to speak on behalf of their race, gender, ethnicity, or other groups they may identify as being a part of. • Acknowledge common ground. Even if you don’t wholeheartedly agree with someone, if you can appreciate something they’ve said or done, let them know. • Call people “in” not “out”. When you are holding someone accountable for an offensive or ignorant statement, think about how to address the hurt they caused and still engage them in the conversation. Resources Style Manuals Students will need to cite all sources for their essays in APA format. Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL) offers a great overview on how to do this: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl Style manuals are located under Research and Citation. University Policies Religious or Holy Day Observance ""A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.” (http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi04-05/ch4/ch4g.html) Email “Electronic mail (e-mail), like postal mail, is a mechanism for official University communication to students. The University will exercise the right to send e-mail communications to all students, and the University will expect that e-mail communications will be received and read in a timely manner.” (http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi04-05/app/appn.html). I will reply to student emails within 24 hours on weekdays and 48 hours on weekends barring a rare and extenuating circumstance. Personal Pronouns 15 Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center (http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-andresources/). I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns. More resources are available on the Gender and Sexuality Center’s website, www.utgsc.org. University Resources for Students Services for Students with Disabilities The university is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive learning environment consistent with university policy and federal and state law. Please let me know if you experience any barriers to learning so I can work with you to ensure you have equal opportunity to participate fully in this course. If you are a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, and need accommodations please contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD). Please refer to SSD’s website for contact and more information: http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. If you are already registered with SSD, please deliver your Accommodation Letter to me as early as possible in the semester so we can discuss your approved accommodations and needs in this course. Counseling and Mental Health Center I urge students who are struggling for any reason and who believe that it might impact their performance in the course to reach out to me if they feel comfortable. This will allow me to provide any resources or accommodations that I can. If immediate mental health assistance is needed, call the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC) at 512-471- 3515 or you may also contact, LCSW (iSchool CARE counselor) at 512-232- 2983.

Course Description
University Catalog Course Description
Facts versus fake news; that is the challenge in today’s digital society. Our world is rife
with misinformation. This is a course about ""calling b***s*** on"" - spotting, dissecting, and
publicly refuting false claims by identifying the casual fallacies, statistical traps, visualmisinformation, scientific claims, fake news, and social media and their sources. This course
will also explore refutation techniques of Disinformation and Mal-Information. Prior
math/stat background unnecessary.
What will I learn?
The power and complexity of information in society, the economy, and our personal lives
grows constantly, primarily due to the digital world. This course will explore information
from multiple angles, with an emphasis on exploring the role of deception in a variety of
areas--politics, international relations, business, advertising, social media, and more.
Increasing information and media literacy skills along with critical thinking related to
research and the world at large are a major competent of this course. This is not a how-touse-the-library or computer science course, although both of those areas will be addressed.
Efficient research, evaluation of information, being able to identify misinformation or “fake
news” and critical analysis are the primary goals.
Main skills and attitudes to be developed
• Critical thinking, collaboration and peer-to-peer problem solving skills
• Understanding the significance of sufficient, documented evidence in research
• Understand the methods of identifying, exposing, and refuting
misinformation, fake news, etc.

How will I learn?
The structure of this course is built around Team-Based Learning (TBL) which is a highly
participatory method. TBL will increase your understanding of course concepts by using them
to solve authentic, real-world problems and help you develop your workplace learning skills. 
3
The primary course goal is to support using course content to solve significant problems; in
fact, the bulk of class time will be spent solving problems and making decisions to help you
become a critical thinker.
Pre-requisites for the course:
None
How to succeed in this course
Focus on expressing and supporting your views. We will have texts and videos that
you have to read carefully in order to participate successfully in the class discussions where you
will be using information to understand important concepts, foster engaging ideas and explore
ways of thinking.
Be reflective. The assigned readings provide the backdrop for discussing the critical
thinking ideas and concepts. Learning in this class is not just memorizing the material and
being able to parrot it back. You will have the opportunity to reflect more deeply on your own
and others’ perspectives and assumptions, and be expected to draw, articulate, and justify
conclusions with solid reasons and citations.
Course Requirements
Required Materials
Texts: Media Manipulation and Disinformation Online, by Alice Marwick and Rebecca
Lewis. Available online via Canvas.
Weekly readings, videos, and lectures will be linked online through canvas.
All class materials, supplemental resources, grades, and announcements will be posted on
the course Canvas site: https://utexas.instructure.com.
Classroom Expectations
Your preparation for discussion and participation is extremely important for you and your
classmates. Here are some ground rules:
• Respect for others is vital. You can expect that as the instructor, I am concerned
about the educational experience of each student in the class, respectful of
individual differences, encouraging of creativity, reasonably open and accessible to
discuss material and assignments, thorough in evaluating assignments, and rigorous
yet supportive in maintaining high standards for performance.
As a student, you are expected to work individually and with others, to create an
atmosphere that is safe, valuing of one another, and open to diverse perspectives.
Everyone is expected to show courtesy, civility, and respect for one another.
Comments or postings that degrade or ridicule another, whether based on individual
or cultural differences, are unacceptable.
• Participation/Engagement. Thinking is not a spectator sport. You need to participate 
4
in class by communicating your understanding and testing others’ understanding with
questions and dialogue. This course requires active participation, which is crucial to
your success in becoming a critical thinker. The more you put into it, the more you
will get out of it. Active participation includes being prepared to discuss readings,
assignments, and concepts, engaging yourself in classroom activities and discussion,
and putting your best effort in both formal and informal assignments. Regardless of
the format we use to conduct class sessions, consider your participation to be the
equivalent to a face-to-face class session and be prepared to engage actively and
thoughtfully with me and your peers.
• Have fun! This course is an adventure in exploring your thought processes,
empowering yourself with the ability to evaluate information, and reasoning through
arguments that you encounter. Some of what we do may be personally and
intellectually uncomfortable. It is OK to express your discomfort as long as you are
open to safely exploring beyond those comfort zones. Make the most of it and have
fun! Most importantly, you don’t even have to agree with me! Just back up facts.

ASSIGNMENTS
Essay Topics
The essay topics are selected to encourage you to synthesize the materials in the modules. My
hope is you will reflect on what you learned in each group of modules and build on those ideas to
develop an essay that addresses the prompt. The prompt is designed to get you thinking about the
topic, but I hope you will take your own personal experiences, undergraduate major, and future
career goals to decide how to take the information in the modules and make it more interesting to
you (and me!)
First Assignment/Essay: Annotated Bibliography. With the plethora of information available
from hundreds of digital sources, the challenge for a researcher is how to develop a research plan
before writing a single line. In this first essay, develop an annotated bibliography of at least five
potential sources you might use for a research topic or an information topic of your choice.
a. The main goal of this assignment is to develop an annotated bibliography to support a
research plan.
b. Student selects a variety of sources covering both sides of an issue. Select a topic to
research and follow-up with at least four sources that support your objective and at least
one that counters or supports a differing opinion and document/cite them as an annotated
bibliography.
Suggested Information Topics (but you may choose your own)
1. Medical Information
2. Digital Library Creation
3. Accuracy or Protection of Information
4. Information and Privacy
c. The student will articulate how their sources relate to their topic, and why they selected
each source using evaluative criteria to critically analyze and support their selected
sources.
d. The Reference module shows you how to cite outside sources in APA format as well as
the how to cite the material both in-text and on your reference page, so make sure you
pay attention to APA formatting.
Second Essay: Media Creation Essay. Five to seven pages, plus a title page and reference
pages. Any media can be accurate, inaccurate, or manipulated to serve an author’s purpose. This
essay should focus on a form of media and the several ways in which media can be manipulated.
a. Beginning with the two articles on Electronic Medical Records, consider how
information is gathered, developed, and managed in the course of its creation and use.
Discuss the process of gathering information, how it is processed and the benefits and/or
risks of aggregating such information.
6
b. Students may wish to evaluate the periodical sources used to support the arguments
made. How do they align with the CRAAP test? Which article (pro/con) is more
credible, if any.
c. Identify any methods of media manipulation, distortion, or misinformation in the articles
with sufficient examples to support your case.
d. A student may wish to elaborate on the pros/cons of digitizing medical records or how
the concept applies to other industries such as finance, government, private industry.
e. Essay 2 will include a peer review component.
Third Essay: Social Media: Commercialization or Weaponization of User Information.
Five to seven pages, plus a title page and reference pages. Consider how personal information is
gathered, aggregated, and used by applications, search engines, and/or social media for
commercial gain or how such information may be weaponized to support or perpetuate a specific
agenda.
From a user’s browser, through their ISP, to a search engine or social media site; what
information can be discovered about a user? What are the potential benefits or liabilities for the
user? For the gatherer? For the purchaser or the redistributor?
This essay helps you focus on the structure of an argument. The use of introductory and
concluding paragraphs, with sound paragraph construction leading a reader to your conclusion.
a. The readings cover several potential topics to consider and should give you plenty of
material to discuss in five pages, so there are a lot of possible directions for this essay.
b. Feel free to use current events or other ideas to make this essay your own. For example,
are these information sources necessary in our digital society; do they make our life (or
work) better? What are the risks?
c. Essay 3 will include a peer review component.
Fourth Essay Qualitative Research Project: Ten Pages minimum. (10-15 pages expected).
Information in the digital age is like a tsunami of disparate and often conflicting data threatening
to drown us in the confusion and turmoil of misinformation, disinformation, fake news, and
‘alternative facts.’ Information comes to use through mobile devices, laptops, the Internet and
everything the Internet makes possible from social media to self-driving cars. Why is such
information important now and into the future? What are the dangers? Or what about emerging
technologies such as, IOT, blockchain/cryptocurrency, AI, biometrics, robotics, etc.?
a.The main goal of the qualitative research paper is for you to demonstrate your skill in
developing a unique research topic and gather appropriate evidence to support your argument.
b.The essay should be research intensive, objective, and demonstrate to your reader that
something is true, rather than “tell” your reader it is true.
c.A qualitative research paper is designed to incorporate methodological strategies to
ensure the ‘trustworthiness’ of the findings. Such strategies include:
i. Accounting for personal biases which may have influenced findings;
ii. Demonstrating critical thinking and reflection of methods used to ensure
sufficient depth and relevance of data collection and analysis;
iii. Demonstrate rigor in your research. Without rigor, research is worthless,
becomes fiction, and loses its utility. Hence, a great deal of attention must be
applied to reliability and validity of one’s research methods.
iv. Establishing a comparison case/seeking out similarities and differences
across accounts to ensure different perspectives are represented.
7
v. Student will use a reliable research process to search for new information and
confirm the validity of sources when considering its use and adoption.
vi. Will your paper and its sources pass the CRAAP test?
vii. This paper will focus on grammar, proper use of citations, and professional
writing style such as seen in an APA style guide. See Owl.Purdue.Edu.
I often see student essays that talk about ""the explosion of the Internet"" or how we can learn
anything at ""the touch of a button"" (avoid both of these expressions!). What these students
really mean to do is to discuss the reliability of information one can find from a specific
source, such as Wikipedia, social media, library databases, corporate, or government
sources and both the positive and negative aspects of that source.
Essays – General Guidelines
Students will complete three essays and one optional essay revision. Each essay will be evaluated
using the traditional undergraduate letter grade scale listed above (A – F). Writing your essay at the
last minute usually results in a poor grade. Each essay is intended to help you focus on a different
writing skill while reviewing the course material. The first essay will focus on documenting
evidence to support your argument, the second on structuring your paper, and the third on your
research and grammar and general writing skills.
For the first essay, for example, 80% of your grade will be based on whether you include well
formatted APA quotations and well formatted citations that use paraphrasing. The other 20% I will
determine by the quality of your writing according to these criteria:
1. Grammar and spelling
2. The clarity of thought demonstrated in your essay
3. Your use of resources (including citations)
4. The structure of the essay and how well you followed writing conventions
5. The overall quality of the essay
The first two essay will include a research/preparatory step, the submission of your draft as an
annotated bibliography, and a rewrite option. You will also note your semester research project for
approval.
The second and third essays submitted once including citations in APA writing style and will
include at least one peer review.
The fourth writing assignment is your final research paper, in APA style with appropriate
citations, illustrations, etc. as necessary.
Essay Format:
Remember to include a title page and bibliography/reference page with each essay. These pages
do NOT count toward the page minimum. The title page should include your name, the title of
your essay, your school, the course number and section, and the date in long format.
Your essay must be submitted to canvas as a WORD document (.DOC or .DOCX) and the
filename needs to start with your last name. For example, my first essay might be named
Louden1.doc. Without this title page and this naming convention, your essay may not be graded!
A PDF file will not be graded; you will receive zero on that assignment.
You must cite all sources withing the essay and provide a complete citation listing in the
references page. Including any module readings or lecture material. All citations should use the 
8
APA Style format. For more information on APA, please see the Purdue University OWL guide:
http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/
All essays will be submitted to Canvas and will be passed through Turnitin or another plagiarism
check software. The results of this software analysis are not the only method I use to determine
whether something is plagiarized. As I said earlier, plagiarism is my least favorite thing to deal with
in this course. Avoid it!
The essay requirements include a page minimum, which means exactly that; if your essay is 75%
of minimum pages, you don’t receive credit. If you expand the margins and increase the point size
from the word defaults and more than double spaced in order to take up more space, you won’t
receive credit. Don’t leave it up to me, write the full amount and make us both happy!
Correct APA formatting is Times Roman font, 12-point type, double spaced, with 1-inch margins.
(I will accept Calibri font, 12 point, but it is a difficult font to read.)
Essay Submission
Submit all assignments using Canvas. Assignments submitted via email will not be counted (I
lose track of them – I get hundreds of emails a day, so I ask that you use Canvas both for
communicating with me and submitting your assignments so we both have a record).
A tutorial for submitting documents is located here: http://edutech.ctl.utexas.edu/submittingassignments/
All essays must be in Microsoft word format, saved as .doc or .docx. 11-point font (whatever the
default is for Word, usually Cambria), double spaced with one-inch margins. I personally prefer
open source software, but Canvas and Turnitin work best with Microsoft.
In addition to these steps, your essays will be sent through Turnitin. I STRONGLY encourage
you to review the Turnitin score and address any issues before the submission is due. I use the
Turnitin score as an indicator of potential problems; Turnitin will highlight what it thinks are
problematic areas, and I typically take a closer look and decide if I agree. If you choose not to
review these highlighted areas and either leave a note explaining why it isn’t a problem or to make
a change and address the issue, you run the risk of failing the assignment and receiving a referral to
Student Conduct and Academic Integrity. Most people never have a problem with this but use the
tool to your advantage to help you avoid plagiarism!
Discussions (12 weeks)
This semester will include weekly discussions on the essays or posted topics, depending on what
the class might be struggling with. Discussions are graded on a 4-point scale; two points for your
original submission and one point for each response to two other students. You must complete all
three parts of the discussion (original post and two responses) and meet the minimum requirements
for credit. If you submit a great original post and only respond to one peer, you can only earn three
points.
2 Points: For most original discussions, your submission should be at least 200 words long and
make it clear to the instructor or TA that you have read the assigned reading for that week. Detailed
instructions are listed on each discussion assignment.
2 Points: In addition, students must respond to the submissions of two other students. These
responses should be at least two sentences long and should move the conversation forward.
Responses of ""I agree. This happened to me once."" or similar short responses will not receive 
9
credit. Maximum effort!
Remember that these word limits are articulated in order to help you understand the minimum
amount of effort required to avoid failing. They don’t represent the minimum effort required to get
an A.

Policies
Statement on Learning Success
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all
learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you,
please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs
and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student resources
available through UT.
Grading Policies
As I hope you can see, flexibility is built into the assignments to support your success in this
course. If you miss a smaller assignment or don’t do as well on your earlier entries, your grade will
not be impacted significantly. Consequently, the final grades are firm, and no additional curve is
available.
A 94 – 100
A - 90 - 93
B + 87 - 89
B 83 - 86
B - 80 - 82
C + 77 - 79

C - 70 - 72
D+ 67 – 69
D 63 - 66
D60 - 62 (minimum for
pass/fail students to pass)
F Below 60
GRACE POLICY: Time-bank options
Sometimes we have bad days, bad weeks, and bad semesters. In an effort to accommodate any
unexpected, unfortunate personal crisis, I have built “time banks” into our course. You do not have
to utilize this policy, but if you find yourself struggling with unexpected personal events, I
encourage you to e-mail me as soon as possible (in advance of due date) to notify me that you are
using our grace policy. You may use this policy one of two ways (please choose, and let me know):
You may have a two-day grace period for one assignment, OR
You may have 2 one-day extensions for two different assignments.
Absences
If you are absent or unable to participate on the day that your team meets, you are responsible
for providing your team with the necessary information to compensate for your absence. It is
crucial to keep in communication with your team members; you are responsible for letting both us
and your team know if you cannot make it to a class.
Excused Absence: The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious
holidays or extenuating circumstances due to an emergency. If you plan to miss class due to
observance of a religious holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will not
be penalized for this absence, although you will still be responsible for any work you will miss on
that day if applicable. Check with us for details or arrangements.
If you have to be absent, use your resources wisely. Ask your team and other classmates to get a
run-down and notes on any lessons you miss. If you find there are topics that we covered while
12
you were gone that raise questions, you may come by during office hours or schedule a meeting to
discuss. Email specific questions you have in advance so that we can make the most of our time.
“What did I miss?” is not specific enough.

University Resources for Students
COVID-19 Update: “Keep Learning” Resources
This course may be offered in a format to which you are unaccustomed. If you are looking for
ideas and strategies to help you feel more comfortable participating in our class, please explore the
resources available here: https://onestop.utexas.edu/keep-learning/
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there
are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical 
13
information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the
building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective
learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as
early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. Any student with a
documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for
Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 512-410-6644 (Video Phone) as soon as possible
to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations. For more information, visit

Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone
you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus
Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
14
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
assembling outside.
• Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
building.
• Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the
first week of class.
• In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not
re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
• Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be
found at: www.utexas.edu/emergency
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our
community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or
have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies
(https://titleix.utexas.edu/relevant-polices/).
Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities,
including faculty, report any information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual
assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all employees who
witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing assignments, class
discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. I am a Responsible Employee and must
report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before
talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask
whether they are a responsible employee. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide
support or remedies without making an official report to the university, please email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call
512-471-0419.
Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are
still mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors
we refer to as sexual misconduct, including the types of sexual misconduct covered under Texas Senate
Bill 212. The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled
campus resources to support survivors.
Emergency Evacuation Procedures

University Policies
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
“As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the
University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT.
Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous
class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to
academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found
at the following web address:
https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the
Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are
only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more
information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
COVID-19 Updates: Fall 2020 Semester
Safety and Class Participation/Masks:
For every face-to-face class experience, we will all need to make some adjustments in order to
benefit from in-person classroom interactions in a safe and healthy manner. Our best protections
against spreading COVID-19 on campus are masks (defined as cloth face coverings) and staying
home if you are showing symptoms. Therefore, for the benefit of everyone, this is means that all
students are required to follow two important rules.
Every student must wear a cloth face covering properly in class and in all campus buildings
at all times.
• Every student must engage in documented daily symptom screening. This means
that each class day in which on campus activities occur, students must upload certification from the
symptom tracking app and confirm that they completed their symptom screening for that day to
Canvas. Students should not upload the results of that screening, just the certificate that they
completed it. If the symptom tracking app recommends that the student isolate rather than coming to
class, then students must not return to class until cleared by a medical professional.
• If a student is not wearing a cloth face covering properly in the classroom (or any UT
building), that student must leave the classroom (and building). If the student refuses to wear a cloth
face covering, class will be dismissed for the remainder of the period, and the student will be subject
to disciplinary action as set forth in the university’s Institutional Rules/General Conduct 11-
404(a)(3). Students who have a condition that precludes the wearing of a cloth face covering must
follow the procedures for obtaining an accommodation (https://orientation.utexas.edu/students-withdisabilities)
Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited:
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, 
16
assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review
sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless
you have my explicit, written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is
a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well
aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with
you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and
Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions,
including failure in the course.
Class Recordings:
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are
protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form.
Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.
Land Acknowledgment
(I) We would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on Indigenous land. Moreover, (I) We
would like to acknowledge and pay our respects to the Carrizo & Comecrudo, Coahuiltecan,
Caddo, Tonkawa, Comanche, Lipan Apache, Alabama-Coushatta, Kickapoo, Tigua Pueblo, and
all the American Indian and Indigenous Peoples and communities who have been or have
become a part of these lands and territories in Texas, here on Turtle Island.
Land Engagements and/or Commitments
In recognition of the ongoing and cumulative challenges faced by Indigenous Peoples in
Central Texas and globally, we call upon The University of Texas at Austin:
To repatriate the ancestral remains held by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory to their
Indigenous descendant communities and Native lands.
To commit to the active recruitment and material support of Native American and Indigenous
students, who currently comprise fewer than 0.2% of UT Austin’s student body.
To support the transition of the Program in Native American and Indigenous Studies into a
Center.
To establish a protocol of research and study on Tribal or Native lands, and to foster an ethics
and practice of engaged scholarship, with and for Indigenous peoples and communities, locally
and internationally. ",,"I 310, Fake News and Facts in the Misinformation Age

 Course Description
 University Catalog Course Description
 Facts versus fake news; that is the challenge in today’s digital society. Our world is rife
 with misinformation. This is a course about ""calling b***s*** on"" - spotting, dissecting, and
 publicly refuting false claims by identifying the casual fallacies, statistical traps, visualmisinformation, scientific claims, fake news, and social media and their sources. This course
 will also explore refutation techniques of Disinformation and Mal-Information. Prior
 math/stat background unnecessary.
 What will I learn?
 The power and complexity of information in society, the economy, and our personal lives
 grows constantly, primarily due to the digital world. This course will explore information
 from multiple angles, with an emphasis on exploring the role of deception in a variety of
 areas--politics, international relations, business, advertising, social media, and more.
 Increasing information and media literacy skills along with critical thinking related to
 research and the world at large are a major competent of this course. This is not a how-touse-the-library or computer science course, although both of those areas will be addressed.
 Efficient research, evaluation of information, being able to identify misinformation or “fake
 news” and critical analysis are the primary goals.
 Main skills and attitudes to be developed
 • Critical thinking, collaboration and peer-to-peer problem solving skills
 • Understanding the significance of sufficient, documented evidence in research
 • Understand the methods of identifying, exposing, and refuting
 misinformation, fake news, etc.

 3. Evaluate the credibility of a source
 4. Demonstrate how to identify fake news, memes, propaganda, and other means of
 deception
 5. Demonstrate how to balance conflicting ‘truths’ to ensure objectivity

 How will I learn?
 The structure of this course is built around Team-Based Learning (TBL) which is a highly
 participatory method. TBL will increase your understanding of course concepts by using them
 to solve authentic, real-world problems and help you develop your workplace learning skills. 
 3
 The primary course goal is to support using course content to solve significant problems; in
 fact, the bulk of class time will be spent solving problems and making decisions to help you
 become a critical thinker.
 Pre-requisites for the course:
 None
 How to succeed in this course
 Focus on expressing and supporting your views. We will have texts and videos that
 you have to read carefully in order to participate successfully in the class discussions where you
 will be using information to understand important concepts, foster engaging ideas and explore
 ways of thinking.
 Be reflective. The assigned readings provide the backdrop for discussing the critical
 thinking ideas and concepts. Learning in this class is not just memorizing the material and
 being able to parrot it back. You will have the opportunity to reflect more deeply on your own
 and others’ perspectives and assumptions, and be expected to draw, articulate, and justify
 conclusions with solid reasons and citations.
 Course Requirements
 Required Materials
 Texts: Media Manipulation and Disinformation Online, by Alice Marwick and Rebecca
 Lewis. Available online via Canvas.
 Weekly readings, videos, and lectures will be linked online through canvas.
 All class materials, supplemental resources, grades, and announcements will be posted on
 the course Canvas site: https://utexas.instructure.com.
 Classroom Expectations
 Your preparation for discussion and participation is extremely important for you and your
 classmates. Here are some ground rules:
 • Respect for others is vital. You can expect that as the instructor, I am concerned
 about the educational experience of each student in the class, respectful of
 individual differences, encouraging of creativity, reasonably open and accessible to
 discuss material and assignments, thorough in evaluating assignments, and rigorous
 yet supportive in maintaining high standards for performance.
 As a student, you are expected to work individually and with others, to create an
 atmosphere that is safe, valuing of one another, and open to diverse perspectives.
 Everyone is expected to show courtesy, civility, and respect for one another.
 Comments or postings that degrade or ridicule another, whether based on individual
 or cultural differences, are unacceptable.
 • Participation/Engagement. Thinking is not a spectator sport. You need to participate 
 4
 in class by communicating your understanding and testing others’ understanding with
 questions and dialogue. This course requires active participation, which is crucial to
 your success in becoming a critical thinker. The more you put into it, the more you
 will get out of it. Active participation includes being prepared to discuss readings,
 assignments, and concepts, engaging yourself in classroom activities and discussion,
 and putting your best effort in both formal and informal assignments. Regardless of
 the format we use to conduct class sessions, consider your participation to be the
 equivalent to a face-to-face class session and be prepared to engage actively and
 thoughtfully with me and your peers.
 • Have fun! This course is an adventure in exploring your thought processes,
 empowering yourself with the ability to evaluate information, and reasoning through
 arguments that you encounter. Some of what we do may be personally and
 intellectually uncomfortable. It is OK to express your discomfort as long as you are
 open to safely exploring beyond those comfort zones. Make the most of it and have
 fun! Most importantly, you don’t even have to agree with me! Just back up facts.

 ASSIGNMENTS
 Essay Topics
 The essay topics are selected to encourage you to synthesize the materials in the modules. My
 hope is you will reflect on what you learned in each group of modules and build on those ideas to
 develop an essay that addresses the prompt. The prompt is designed to get you thinking about the
 topic, but I hope you will take your own personal experiences, undergraduate major, and future
 career goals to decide how to take the information in the modules and make it more interesting to
 you (and me!)
 First Assignment/Essay: Annotated Bibliography. With the plethora of information available
 from hundreds of digital sources, the challenge for a researcher is how to develop a research plan
 before writing a single line. In this first essay, develop an annotated bibliography of at least five
 potential sources you might use for a research topic or an information topic of your choice.
 a. The main goal of this assignment is to develop an annotated bibliography to support a
 research plan.
 b. Student selects a variety of sources covering both sides of an issue. Select a topic to
 research and follow-up with at least four sources that support your objective and at least
 one that counters or supports a differing opinion and document/cite them as an annotated
 bibliography.
 Suggested Information Topics (but you may choose your own)
 1. Medical Information
 2. Digital Library Creation
 3. Accuracy or Protection of Information
 4. Information and Privacy
 c. The student will articulate how their sources relate to their topic, and why they selected
 each source using evaluative criteria to critically analyze and support their selected
 sources.
 d. The Reference module shows you how to cite outside sources in APA format as well as
 the how to cite the material both in-text and on your reference page, so make sure you
 pay attention to APA formatting.
 Second Essay: Media Creation Essay. Five to seven pages, plus a title page and reference
 pages. Any media can be accurate, inaccurate, or manipulated to serve an author’s purpose. This
 essay should focus on a form of media and the several ways in which media can be manipulated.
 a. Beginning with the two articles on Electronic Medical Records, consider how
 information is gathered, developed, and managed in the course of its creation and use.
 Discuss the process of gathering information, how it is processed and the benefits and/or
 risks of aggregating such information.
 6
 b. Students may wish to evaluate the periodical sources used to support the arguments
 made. How do they align with the CRAAP test? Which article (pro/con) is more
 credible, if any.
 c. Identify any methods of media manipulation, distortion, or misinformation in the articles
 with sufficient examples to support your case.
 d. A student may wish to elaborate on the pros/cons of digitizing medical records or how
 the concept applies to other industries such as finance, government, private industry.
 e. Essay 2 will include a peer review component.
 Third Essay: Social Media: Commercialization or Weaponization of User Information.
 Five to seven pages, plus a title page and reference pages. Consider how personal information is
 gathered, aggregated, and used by applications, search engines, and/or social media for
 commercial gain or how such information may be weaponized to support or perpetuate a specific
 agenda.
 From a user’s browser, through their ISP, to a search engine or social media site; what
 information can be discovered about a user? What are the potential benefits or liabilities for the
 user? For the gatherer? For the purchaser or the redistributor?
 This essay helps you focus on the structure of an argument. The use of introductory and
 concluding paragraphs, with sound paragraph construction leading a reader to your conclusion.
 a. The readings cover several potential topics to consider and should give you plenty of
 material to discuss in five pages, so there are a lot of possible directions for this essay.
 b. Feel free to use current events or other ideas to make this essay your own. For example,
 are these information sources necessary in our digital society; do they make our life (or
 work) better? What are the risks?
 c. Essay 3 will include a peer review component.
 Fourth Essay Qualitative Research Project: Ten Pages minimum. (10-15 pages expected).
 Information in the digital age is like a tsunami of disparate and often conflicting data threatening
 to drown us in the confusion and turmoil of misinformation, disinformation, fake news, and
 ‘alternative facts.’ Information comes to use through mobile devices, laptops, the Internet and
 everything the Internet makes possible from social media to self-driving cars. Why is such
 information important now and into the future? What are the dangers? Or what about emerging
 technologies such as, IOT, blockchain/cryptocurrency, AI, biometrics, robotics, etc.?
 a.The main goal of the qualitative research paper is for you to demonstrate your skill in
 developing a unique research topic and gather appropriate evidence to support your argument.
 b.The essay should be research intensive, objective, and demonstrate to your reader that
 something is true, rather than “tell” your reader it is true.
 c.A qualitative research paper is designed to incorporate methodological strategies to
 ensure the ‘trustworthiness’ of the findings. Such strategies include:
 i. Accounting for personal biases which may have influenced findings;
 ii. Demonstrating critical thinking and reflection of methods used to ensure
 sufficient depth and relevance of data collection and analysis;
 iii. Demonstrate rigor in your research. Without rigor, research is worthless,
 becomes fiction, and loses its utility. Hence, a great deal of attention must be
 applied to reliability and validity of one’s research methods.
 iv. Establishing a comparison case/seeking out similarities and differences
 across accounts to ensure different perspectives are represented.
 7
 v. Student will use a reliable research process to search for new information and
 confirm the validity of sources when considering its use and adoption.
 vi. Will your paper and its sources pass the CRAAP test?
 vii. This paper will focus on grammar, proper use of citations, and professional
 writing style such as seen in an APA style guide. See Owl.Purdue.Edu.
 I often see student essays that talk about ""the explosion of the Internet"" or how we can learn
 anything at ""the touch of a button"" (avoid both of these expressions!). What these students
 really mean to do is to discuss the reliability of information one can find from a specific
 source, such as Wikipedia, social media, library databases, corporate, or government
 sources and both the positive and negative aspects of that source.
 Essays – General Guidelines
 Students will complete three essays and one optional essay revision. Each essay will be evaluated
 using the traditional undergraduate letter grade scale listed above (A – F). Writing your essay at the
 last minute usually results in a poor grade. Each essay is intended to help you focus on a different
 writing skill while reviewing the course material. The first essay will focus on documenting
 evidence to support your argument, the second on structuring your paper, and the third on your
 research and grammar and general writing skills.
 For the first essay, for example, 80% of your grade will be based on whether you include well
 formatted APA quotations and well formatted citations that use paraphrasing. The other 20% I will
 determine by the quality of your writing according to these criteria:
 1. Grammar and spelling
 2. The clarity of thought demonstrated in your essay
 3. Your use of resources (including citations)
 4. The structure of the essay and how well you followed writing conventions
 5. The overall quality of the essay
 The first two essay will include a research/preparatory step, the submission of your draft as an
 annotated bibliography, and a rewrite option. You will also note your semester research project for
 approval.
 The second and third essays submitted once including citations in APA writing style and will
 include at least one peer review.
 The fourth writing assignment is your final research paper, in APA style with appropriate
 citations, illustrations, etc. as necessary.
 Essay Format:
 Remember to include a title page and bibliography/reference page with each essay. These pages
 do NOT count toward the page minimum. The title page should include your name, the title of
 your essay, your school, the course number and section, and the date in long format.
 Your essay must be submitted to canvas as a WORD document (.DOC or .DOCX) and the
 filename needs to start with your last name. For example, my first essay might be named
 Louden1.doc. Without this title page and this naming convention, your essay may not be graded!
 A PDF file will not be graded; you will receive zero on that assignment.
 You must cite all sources withing the essay and provide a complete citation listing in the
 references page. Including any module readings or lecture material. All citations should use the 
 8
 APA Style format. For more information on APA, please see the Purdue University OWL guide:
 http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/
 All essays will be submitted to Canvas and will be passed through Turnitin or another plagiarism
 check software. The results of this software analysis are not the only method I use to determine
 whether something is plagiarized. As I said earlier, plagiarism is my least favorite thing to deal with
 in this course. Avoid it!
 The essay requirements include a page minimum, which means exactly that; if your essay is 75%
 of minimum pages, you don’t receive credit. If you expand the margins and increase the point size
 from the word defaults and more than double spaced in order to take up more space, you won’t
 receive credit. Don’t leave it up to me, write the full amount and make us both happy!
 Correct APA formatting is Times Roman font, 12-point type, double spaced, with 1-inch margins.
 (I will accept Calibri font, 12 point, but it is a difficult font to read.)
 Essay Submission
 Submit all assignments using Canvas. Assignments submitted via email will not be counted (I
 lose track of them – I get hundreds of emails a day, so I ask that you use Canvas both for
 communicating with me and submitting your assignments so we both have a record).
 A tutorial for submitting documents is located here: http://edutech.ctl.utexas.edu/submittingassignments/
 All essays must be in Microsoft word format, saved as .doc or .docx. 11-point font (whatever the
 default is for Word, usually Cambria), double spaced with one-inch margins. I personally prefer
 open source software, but Canvas and Turnitin work best with Microsoft.
 In addition to these steps, your essays will be sent through Turnitin. I STRONGLY encourage
 you to review the Turnitin score and address any issues before the submission is due. I use the
 Turnitin score as an indicator of potential problems; Turnitin will highlight what it thinks are
 problematic areas, and I typically take a closer look and decide if I agree. If you choose not to
 review these highlighted areas and either leave a note explaining why it isn’t a problem or to make
 a change and address the issue, you run the risk of failing the assignment and receiving a referral to
 Student Conduct and Academic Integrity. Most people never have a problem with this but use the
 tool to your advantage to help you avoid plagiarism!
 Discussions (12 weeks)
 This semester will include weekly discussions on the essays or posted topics, depending on what
 the class might be struggling with. Discussions are graded on a 4-point scale; two points for your
 original submission and one point for each response to two other students. You must complete all
 three parts of the discussion (original post and two responses) and meet the minimum requirements
 for credit. If you submit a great original post and only respond to one peer, you can only earn three
 points.
 2 Points: For most original discussions, your submission should be at least 200 words long and
 make it clear to the instructor or TA that you have read the assigned reading for that week. Detailed
 instructions are listed on each discussion assignment.
 2 Points: In addition, students must respond to the submissions of two other students. These
 responses should be at least two sentences long and should move the conversation forward.
 Responses of ""I agree. This happened to me once."" or similar short responses will not receive 
 9
 credit. Maximum effort!
 Remember that these word limits are articulated in order to help you understand the minimum
 amount of effort required to avoid failing. They don’t represent the minimum effort required to get
 an A.

 Policies
 Statement on Learning Success
 Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all
 learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you,
 please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs
 and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student resources
 available through UT.
 Grading Policies
 As I hope you can see, flexibility is built into the assignments to support your success in this
 course. If you miss a smaller assignment or don’t do as well on your earlier entries, your grade will
 not be impacted significantly. Consequently, the final grades are firm, and no additional curve is
 available.
 A 94 – 100
 A - 90 - 93
 B + 87 - 89
 B 83 - 86
 B - 80 - 82
 C + 77 - 79
 C 73 - 76
 C - 70 - 72
 D+ 67 – 69
 D 63 - 66
 D60 - 62 (minimum for
 pass/fail students to pass)
 F Below 60
 GRACE POLICY: Time-bank options
 Sometimes we have bad days, bad weeks, and bad semesters. In an effort to accommodate any
 unexpected, unfortunate personal crisis, I have built “time banks” into our course. You do not have
 to utilize this policy, but if you find yourself struggling with unexpected personal events, I
 encourage you to e-mail me as soon as possible (in advance of due date) to notify me that you are
 using our grace policy. You may use this policy one of two ways (please choose, and let me know):
 You may have a two-day grace period for one assignment, OR
 You may have 2 one-day extensions for two different assignments.
 Absences
 If you are absent or unable to participate on the day that your team meets, you are responsible
 for providing your team with the necessary information to compensate for your absence. It is
 crucial to keep in communication with your team members; you are responsible for letting both us
 and your team know if you cannot make it to a class.
 Excused Absence: The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious
 holidays or extenuating circumstances due to an emergency. If you plan to miss class due to
 observance of a religious holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will not
 be penalized for this absence, although you will still be responsible for any work you will miss on
 that day if applicable. Check with us for details or arrangements.
 If you have to be absent, use your resources wisely. Ask your team and other classmates to get a
 run-down and notes on any lessons you miss. If you find there are topics that we covered while
 12
 you were gone that raise questions, you may come by during office hours or schedule a meeting to
 discuss. Email specific questions you have in advance so that we can make the most of our time.
 “What did I miss?” is not specific enough.

 Course Description
 University Catalog Course Description
 Facts versus fake news; that is the challenge in today’s digital society. Our world is rife
 with misinformation. This is a course about ""calling b***s*** on"" - spotting, dissecting, and
 publicly refuting false claims by identifying the casual fallacies, statistical traps, visualmisinformation, scientific claims, fake news, and social media and their sources. This course
 will also explore refutation techniques of Disinformation and Mal-Information. Prior
 math/stat background unnecessary.
 What will I learn?
 The power and complexity of information in society, the economy, and our personal lives
 grows constantly, primarily due to the digital world. This course will explore information
 from multiple angles, with an emphasis on exploring the role of deception in a variety of
 areas--politics, international relations, business, advertising, social media, and more.
 Increasing information and media literacy skills along with critical thinking related to
 research and the world at large are a major competent of this course. This is not a how-touse-the-library or computer science course, although both of those areas will be addressed.
 Efficient research, evaluation of information, being able to identify misinformation or “fake
 news” and critical analysis are the primary goals.
 Main skills and attitudes to be developed
 • Critical thinking, collaboration and peer-to-peer problem solving skills
 • Understanding the significance of sufficient, documented evidence in research
 • Understand the methods of identifying, exposing, and refuting
 misinformation, fake news, etc.

 participatory method. TBL will increase your understanding of course concepts by using them
 to solve authentic, real-world problems and help you develop your workplace learning skills.

 The primary course goal is to support using course content to solve significant problems; in
 fact, the bulk of class time will be spent solving problems and making decisions to help you
 become a critical thinker.
 Pre-requisites for the course:
 None
 How to succeed in this course
 Focus on expressing and supporting your views. We will have texts and videos that
 you have to read carefully in order to participate successfully in the class discussions where you
 will be using information to understand important concepts, foster engaging ideas and explore
 ways of thinking.
 Be reflective. The assigned readings provide the backdrop for discussing the critical
 thinking ideas and concepts. Learning in this class is not just memorizing the material and
 being able to parrot it back. You will have the opportunity to reflect more deeply on your own
 and others’ perspectives and assumptions, and be expected to draw, articulate, and justify
 conclusions with solid reasons and citations.
 Course Requirements
 Required Materials
 Texts: Media Manipulation and Disinformation Online, by Alice Marwick and Rebecca
 Lewis. Available online via Canvas.
 Weekly readings, videos, and lectures will be linked online through canvas.
 All class materials, supplemental resources, grades, and announcements will be posted on
 the course Canvas site: https://utexas.instructure.com.
 Classroom Expectations
 Your preparation for discussion and participation is extremely important for you and your
 classmates. Here are some ground rules:
 • Respect for others is vital. You can expect that as the instructor, I am concerned
 about the educational experience of each student in the class, respectful of
 individual differences, encouraging of creativity, reasonably open and accessible to
 discuss material and assignments, thorough in evaluating assignments, and rigorous
 yet supportive in maintaining high standards for performance.
 As a student, you are expected to work individually and with others, to create an
 atmosphere that is safe, valuing of one another, and open to diverse perspectives.
 Everyone is expected to show courtesy, civility, and respect for one another.
 Comments or postings that degrade or ridicule another, whether based on individual
 or cultural differences, are unacceptable.
 • Participation/Engagement. Thinking is not a spectator sport. You need to participate 
 4
 in class by communicating your understanding and testing others’ understanding with
 questions and dialogue. This course requires active participation, which is crucial to
 your success in becoming a critical thinker. The more you put into it, the more you
 will get out of it. Active participation includes being prepared to discuss readings,
 assignments, and concepts, engaging yourself in classroom activities and discussion,
 and putting your best effort in both formal and informal assignments. Regardless of
 the format we use to conduct class sessions, consider your participation to be the
 equivalent to a face-to-face class session and be prepared to engage actively and
 thoughtfully with me and your peers.
 • Have fun! This course is an adventure in exploring your thought processes,
 empowering yourself with the ability to evaluate information, and reasoning through
 arguments that you encounter. Some of what we do may be personally and
 intellectually uncomfortable. It is OK to express your discomfort as long as you are
 open to safely exploring beyond those comfort zones. Make the most of it and have
 fun! Most importantly, you don’t even have to agree with me! Just back up facts.

 responsibility to note these changes when announced (although I will do my best to ensure that you
 receive the changes with as much advanced notice as possible).
 ASSIGNMENTS
 Essay Topics
 The essay topics are selected to encourage you to synthesize the materials in the modules. My
 hope is you will reflect on what you learned in each group of modules and build on those ideas to
 develop an essay that addresses the prompt. The prompt is designed to get you thinking about the
 topic, but I hope you will take your own personal experiences, undergraduate major, and future
 career goals to decide how to take the information in the modules and make it more interesting to
 you (and me!)
 First Assignment/Essay: Annotated Bibliography. With the plethora of information available
 from hundreds of digital sources, the challenge for a researcher is how to develop a research plan
 before writing a single line. In this first essay, develop an annotated bibliography of at least five
 potential sources you might use for a research topic or an information topic of your choice.
 a. The main goal of this assignment is to develop an annotated bibliography to support a
 research plan.
 b. Student selects a variety of sources covering both sides of an issue. Select a topic to
 research and follow-up with at least four sources that support your objective and at least
 one that counters or supports a differing opinion and document/cite them as an annotated
 bibliography.
 Suggested Information Topics (but you may choose your own)
 1. Medical Information
 2. Digital Library Creation
 3. Accuracy or Protection of Information
 4. Information and Privacy
 c. The student will articulate how their sources relate to their topic, and why they selected
 each source using evaluative criteria to critically analyze and support their selected
 sources.
 d. The Reference module shows you how to cite outside sources in APA format as well as
 the how to cite the material both in-text and on your reference page, so make sure you
 pay attention to APA formatting.
 Second Essay: Media Creation Essay. Five to seven pages, plus a title page and reference
 pages. Any media can be accurate, inaccurate, or manipulated to serve an author’s purpose. This
 essay should focus on a form of media and the several ways in which media can be manipulated.
 a. Beginning with the two articles on Electronic Medical Records, consider how
 information is gathered, developed, and managed in the course of its creation and use.
 Discuss the process of gathering information, how it is processed and the benefits and/or
 risks of aggregating such information.
 6
 b. Students may wish to evaluate the periodical sources used to support the arguments
 made. How do they align with the CRAAP test? Which article (pro/con) is more
 credible, if any.
 c. Identify any methods of media manipulation, distortion, or misinformation in the articles
 with sufficient examples to support your case.
 d. A student may wish to elaborate on the pros/cons of digitizing medical records or how
 the concept applies to other industries such as finance, government, private industry.
 e. Essay 2 will include a peer review component.
 Third Essay: Social Media: Commercialization or Weaponization of User Information.
 Five to seven pages, plus a title page and reference pages. Consider how personal information is
 gathered, aggregated, and used by applications, search engines, and/or social media for
 commercial gain or how such information may be weaponized to support or perpetuate a specific
 agenda.
 From a user’s browser, through their ISP, to a search engine or social media site; what
 information can be discovered about a user? What are the potential benefits or liabilities for the
 user? For the gatherer? For the purchaser or the redistributor?
 This essay helps you focus on the structure of an argument. The use of introductory and
 concluding paragraphs, with sound paragraph construction leading a reader to your conclusion.
 a. The readings cover several potential topics to consider and should give you plenty of
 material to discuss in five pages, so there are a lot of possible directions for this essay.
 b. Feel free to use current events or other ideas to make this essay your own. For example,
 are these information sources necessary in our digital society; do they make our life (or
 work) better? What are the risks?
 c. Essay 3 will include a peer review component.
 Fourth Essay Qualitative Research Project: Ten Pages minimum. (10-15 pages expected).
 Information in the digital age is like a tsunami of disparate and often conflicting data threatening
 to drown us in the confusion and turmoil of misinformation, disinformation, fake news, and
 ‘alternative facts.’ Information comes to use through mobile devices, laptops, the Internet and
 everything the Internet makes possible from social media to self-driving cars. Why is such
 information important now and into the future? What are the dangers? Or what about emerging
 technologies such as, IOT, blockchain/cryptocurrency, AI, biometrics, robotics, etc.?
 a.The main goal of the qualitative research paper is for you to demonstrate your skill in
 developing a unique research topic and gather appropriate evidence to support your argument.
 b.The essay should be research intensive, objective, and demonstrate to your reader that
 something is true, rather than “tell” your reader it is true.
 c.A qualitative research paper is designed to incorporate methodological strategies to
 ensure the ‘trustworthiness’ of the findings. Such strategies include:
 i. Accounting for personal biases which may have influenced findings;
 ii. Demonstrating critical thinking and reflection of methods used to ensure
 sufficient depth and relevance of data collection and analysis;
 iii. Demonstrate rigor in your research. Without rigor, research is worthless,
 becomes fiction, and loses its utility. Hence, a great deal of attention must be
 applied to reliability and validity of one’s research methods.
 iv. Establishing a comparison case/seeking out similarities and differences
 across accounts to ensure different perspectives are represented.
 7
 v. Student will use a reliable research process to search for new information and
 confirm the validity of sources when considering its use and adoption.
 vi. Will your paper and its sources pass the CRAAP test?
 vii. This paper will focus on grammar, proper use of citations, and professional
 writing style such as seen in an APA style guide. See Owl.Purdue.Edu.
 I often see student essays that talk about ""the explosion of the Internet"" or how we can learn
 anything at ""the touch of a button"" (avoid both of these expressions!). What these students
 really mean to do is to discuss the reliability of information one can find from a specific
 source, such as Wikipedia, social media, library databases, corporate, or government
 sources and both the positive and negative aspects of that source.
 Essays – General Guidelines
 Students will complete three essays and one optional essay revision. Each essay will be evaluated
 using the traditional undergraduate letter grade scale listed above (A – F). Writing your essay at the
 last minute usually results in a poor grade. Each essay is intended to help you focus on a different
 writing skill while reviewing the course material. The first essay will focus on documenting
 evidence to support your argument, the second on structuring your paper, and the third on your
 research and grammar and general writing skills.
 For the first essay, for example, 80% of your grade will be based on whether you include well
 formatted APA quotations and well formatted citations that use paraphrasing. The other 20% I will
 determine by the quality of your writing according to these criteria:
 1. Grammar and spelling
 2. The clarity of thought demonstrated in your essay
 3. Your use of resources (including citations)
 4. The structure of the essay and how well you followed writing conventions
 5. The overall quality of the essay
 The first two essay will include a research/preparatory step, the submission of your draft as an
 annotated bibliography, and a rewrite option. You will also note your semester research project for
 approval.
 The second and third essays submitted once including citations in APA writing style and will
 include at least one peer review.
 The fourth writing assignment is your final research paper, in APA style with appropriate
 citations, illustrations, etc. as necessary.
 Essay Format:
 Remember to include a title page and bibliography/reference page with each essay. These pages
 do NOT count toward the page minimum. The title page should include your name, the title of
 your essay, your school, the course number and section, and the date in long format.
 Your essay must be submitted to canvas as a WORD document (.DOC or .DOCX) and the
 filename needs to start with your last name. For example, my first essay might be named
 Louden1.doc. Without this title page and this naming convention, your essay may not be graded!
 A PDF file will not be graded; you will receive zero on that assignment.
 You must cite all sources withing the essay and provide a complete citation listing in the
 references page. Including any module readings or lecture material. All citations should use the 
 8
 APA Style format. For more information on APA, please see the Purdue University OWL guide:
 http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/
 All essays will be submitted to Canvas and will be passed through Turnitin or another plagiarism
 check software. The results of this software analysis are not the only method I use to determine
 whether something is plagiarized. As I said earlier, plagiarism is my least favorite thing to deal with
 in this course. Avoid it!
 The essay requirements include a page minimum, which means exactly that; if your essay is 75%
 of minimum pages, you don’t receive credit. If you expand the margins and increase the point size
 from the word defaults and more than double spaced in order to take up more space, you won’t
 receive credit. Don’t leave it up to me, write the full amount and make us both happy!
 Correct APA formatting is Times Roman font, 12-point type, double spaced, with 1-inch margins.
 (I will accept Calibri font, 12 point, but it is a difficult font to read.)
 Essay Submission
 Submit all assignments using Canvas. Assignments submitted via email will not be counted (I
 lose track of them – I get hundreds of emails a day, so I ask that you use Canvas both for
 communicating with me and submitting your assignments so we both have a record).
 A tutorial for submitting documents is located here: http://edutech.ctl.utexas.edu/submittingassignments/
 All essays must be in Microsoft word format, saved as .doc or .docx. 11-point font (whatever the
 default is for Word, usually Cambria), double spaced with one-inch margins. I personally prefer
 open source software, but Canvas and Turnitin work best with Microsoft.
 In addition to these steps, your essays will be sent through Turnitin. I STRONGLY encourage
 you to review the Turnitin score and address any issues before the submission is due. I use the
 Turnitin score as an indicator of potential problems; Turnitin will highlight what it thinks are
 problematic areas, and I typically take a closer look and decide if I agree. If you choose not to
 review these highlighted areas and either leave a note explaining why it isn’t a problem or to make
 a change and address the issue, you run the risk of failing the assignment and receiving a referral to
 Student Conduct and Academic Integrity. Most people never have a problem with this but use the
 tool to your advantage to help you avoid plagiarism!
 Discussions (12 weeks)
 This semester will include weekly discussions on the essays or posted topics, depending on what
 the class might be struggling with. Discussions are graded on a 4-point scale; two points for your
 original submission and one point for each response to two other students. You must complete all
 three parts of the discussion (original post and two responses) and meet the minimum requirements
 for credit. If you submit a great original post and only respond to one peer, you can only earn three
 points.
 2 Points: For most original discussions, your submission should be at least 200 words long and
 make it clear to the instructor or TA that you have read the assigned reading for that week. Detailed
 instructions are listed on each discussion assignment.
 2 Points: In addition, students must respond to the submissions of two other students. These
 responses should be at least two sentences long and should move the conversation forward.
 Responses of ""I agree. This happened to me once."" or similar short responses will not receive 
 9
 credit. Maximum effort!
 Remember that these word limits are articulated in order to help you understand the minimum
 amount of effort required to avoid failing. They don’t represent the minimum effort required to get
 an A.

 Policies
 Statement on Learning Success
 Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all
 learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you,
 please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs
 and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student resources
 available through UT.
 Grading Policies
 As I hope you can see, flexibility is built into the assignments to support your success in this
 course. If you miss a smaller assignment or don’t do as well on your earlier entries, your grade will
 not be impacted significantly. Consequently, the final grades are firm, and no additional curve is
 available.
 A 94 – 100
 A - 90 - 93
 B + 87 - 89
 B 83 - 86
 B - 80 - 82
 C + 77 - 79
 C 73 - 76
 C - 70 - 72
 D+ 67 – 69
 D 63 - 66
 D60 - 62 (minimum for
 pass/fail students to pass)
 F Below 60
 GRACE POLICY: Time-bank options
 Sometimes we have bad days, bad weeks, and bad semesters. In an effort to accommodate any
 unexpected, unfortunate personal crisis, I have built “time banks” into our course. You do not have
 to utilize this policy, but if you find yourself struggling with unexpected personal events, I
 encourage you to e-mail me as soon as possible (in advance of due date) to notify me that you are
 using our grace policy. You may use this policy one of two ways (please choose, and let me know):
 You may have a two-day grace period for one assignment, OR
 You may have 2 one-day extensions for two different assignments.
 Absences
 If you are absent or unable to participate on the day that your team meets, you are responsible
 for providing your team with the necessary information to compensate for your absence. It is
 crucial to keep in communication with your team members; you are responsible for letting both us
 and your team know if you cannot make it to a class.
 Excused Absence: The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious
 holidays or extenuating circumstances due to an emergency. If you plan to miss class due to
 observance of a religious holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will not
 be penalized for this absence, although you will still be responsible for any work you will miss on
 that day if applicable. Check with us for details or arrangements.
 If you have to be absent, use your resources wisely. Ask your team and other classmates to get a
 run-down and notes on any lessons you miss. If you find there are topics that we covered while
 12
 you were gone that raise questions, you may come by during office hours or schedule a meeting to
 discuss. Email specific questions you have in advance so that we can make the most of our time.
 “What did I miss?” is not specific enough.

University of Texas at Austin,Introduction to Social Justice Informatics,https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/webform/syllabi/Introduction%20to%20Social%20Justice%20Informatics%20Syllabus_Spring%202022.pdf,Found,"This course considers how justice theories can inform how information and communication technologies (ICTs) and communities can respond to implicit and
explicit biases among historically excluded populations. It also critically reflects on existing orientations towards social justice with its commitments to punitive
sanctions, and examines alternative approaches like restorative and transformative justice, which advocate for systems of accountability. Transformative justice
seeks to replace harmful and ineffective institutions by developing social programs and creating alternative structures that center care, accountability, and healing.
Organizational challenges include recognizing and proactively addressing racism, gender discrimination, and other forms of inequity in professional and
academic environments. Many aspects of discrimination have long and deep histories. They have become structural, or part of a self-reproducing cycle. But it is
important to recognize that they are not normal or natural, but instead the result of a history of injustice. In this course we take an action-oriented approach,
focusing on identifying and addressing discrimination in its many realizations. We will draw from history and social science perspectives to better understand the
forces and structures that support racism and other forms of discrimination, and the kinds of actions that are most effective against them.
While this course, in its singularity, cannot eradicate all systems of oppression, this course seeks to equip students with the knowledge, critical thinking and
evaluative skills necessary to better understand how systems of oppression disempower minoritized groups. We will explore human flourishing to counterbalance
trauma-laden research and design practices often associated with minoritized groups. This course will help students acknowledge the full humanity of groups that
have been reduced to deficits.
INF310J - Introduction to Social Justice Informatics - Smith - Spring 2022 Page 2 of 20
This course will explore questions such as,
● What would be a just socio-technical system for adjudicating and evaluating harm?
● What are the unintended consequences of not considering the fullness of BIPOC participants?
● How might we envision community intervention approaches to repair harm and healing for historically excluded populations?
The field of informatics has an incredible impact on society these days. The potential benefits are great but so are its risks, especially if not enough attention is
paid to its impacts on everyone, irrespective of race, class, gender, religion, geographic location, etc. Discrimination is both a technical, organizational, and
systemic challenge. We will attempt to answer these questions by exploring specific steps of the design and implementation process as well as various
methodological and theoretical approaches.
In this course, we take an action-oriented approach, focusing on identifying and addressing discrimination in its many realizations in information and
communication technologies. We will draw from historical and social science perspectives to better understand the forces and structures that support racism and
other forms of discrimination (e.g. gender, ableism, gender identity, etc.), and the kinds of actions that are most effective against them.

attendance and class participation (25%)
discussion This course is student-centered. The vast majority of the learning in this class will occur within the classroom and via Canvas, you
are required to attend class regularly and to complete all Canvas readings and assignments including all videos. Attendance will be taken during
each class period. Absences will only be excused in situations following university policy (illness, family emergency, religious holy days,
participation in University activities at the request of university authorities, and compelling absences beyond your control) with proper
documentation and timely notification (prior to class for non-emergencies). Excessive tardiness may be considered as an unexcused absence
except in situations following university policy. Attendance in asynchronous activities will be measured via Canvas.
The quality of class discussion will be determined by what you put into it. Class participation is a critical element of this course. The
effectiveness of the course will be significantly impacted by the quality of your participation. Class participation is not merely attendance, but
rather factors in your overall contributions to the collaborative learning environment, based on both the quantity and quality of your
interactions in all aspects of the course. Discussion of class participation with the instructor is encouraged in order to ensure that you are
making the most of the classroom experience and the accompanying opportunities for learning. You are expected to participate in all aspects of
class discussion.
As you read or watch each course text, note what you find surprising. Come to each class with questions, ready to discuss what surprised you,
to critique each text, and to discuss how each text relates to other course texts. Be prepared to contribute to all class discussions, including
small-group activities, and bring your creativity. You may bring a laptop or tablet to class to take notes and to access readings, but please
refrain from checking your email, social media, etc. At the close of every Wednesday class, we will do an activity, i like, i wish, what if…. This
is a design activity, but it allows you to provide constructive feedback to improve the course as we move through it together.
course texts You are expected to put time aside before each class to read/view ALL course texts, thoroughly. To help you prioritize, a number of texts are
marked “k” to indicate that these are key course texts, while some texts in the syllabus are marked “sr” to indicate that you may skim-read these texts. Key course
texts are texts that you are expected to read/view thoroughly and draw upon throughout the quarter. Skim-reading means making sure you get a sense of that
text’s central arguments. Please note that we may assign some additional texts throughout the course.
University of Texas at Austin, School of Information
INF310J - Introduction to Social Justice Informatics - Smith - Spring 2022 Page 4 of 20
discussion questions (10%) Each week, you will prepare and submit to Canvas a discussion question about the assigned reading for that week. Discussion
questions are due in Canvas the day before class, at noon. The discussion question should be focused on one or more of the required readings and should make
it clear that you have both read and thought about the assigned material. Your instructor will select a few of the discussion questions to guide the discussion of the
week’s readings during. Discussion questions are an opportunity for you to bring your own particular point of view and interests to the material we cover in class,
and you are encouraged to connect the material to current events and prior learning both in this class and other courses you may have taken. Discussion questions
should be conversation starters. It might help for you to look for an idea or assertion in the reading that you found interesting and would like to talk to your peers
about in class. Discussion questions should invite an interesting conversation, not just end in a simple yes or no answer.
journal entries (20%) At the end of each week throughout the semester, with the aim of promoting deep reflection, you will post a Journal Entry to Canvas by
5 PM each Friday, reflecting on course texts and/or class discussions from that week. There is no need to develop a formal argument. Stream-of-consciousness,
informal prose, a list of questions, and bullet-points are all appropriate. Try to avoid “the pressure to be profound”; a Journal Entry should be simple and honest.
If you respond to one another’s Journal Entries, please be respectful. There are 13 weeks in this semester and thus 13 possible journal entries; however, you are
only required to complete 10 weeks (of your choosing) of journal entries.
module assignments (30%) Throughout the semester, there will be 3 module assignments to synthesize the learnings and extend your critical thinking skills.
For specifics of each assignment, please refer to the individual assignment page. Broadly speaking, Module Assignment #1 will have you exploring geospatial
data to perform a demographic analysis, Module Assignment #2 pushes you into the design methodologies exploring participatory design, and Module
Assignment #3 challenges you in a team design challenge. There are various ways to approach each Module Assignment, and we will dive in-depth as to what is
required.
course reflection (15%) At the end of the semester, you will submit a 1500 word final reflection, through which you will explore the meanings of the terms
“social justice,” “human rights,” “information and communication technologies (ICTs),” and “harm”. Questions you might address: How should we define these
terms? What are the differences and commonalities between them? How are these concepts connected? How have the course texts from the previous weeks
related to these concepts? Further, expand your thinking into the latter half of this course in which we study and discuss the critiques and limitations of the design
processes – including the ethical and political implication of social change – in what ways have your understandings and attitudes about social justice, human
rights, ICTs, and harm shifted? How does designing for systemic social change compare to designing everyday objects? For the last part of your reflection,
include some of the things you have learned throughout the semester. You might reflect on your experiences working on your in-class activities, Module
Assignments, or you might reflect on the design process at a theoretical level. This paper is your opportunity to illustrate what you have learned, what you might
be cynical about, and what questions you will take away with you.
Do not summarize the course texts; focus on deep analysis. You may include in your reflection any lingering questions you have about these concepts and/or the
course texts for the upcoming week. Please provide full citations, including for course texts. If you go beyond course texts, cite credible sources only.

learning edges Please remain open to receiving and analyzing a wide variety of texts, many of which include portrayals of race, violence, questions of gender
identity, sexuality in its many expressions, racism, and ‘other’ complex, nuanced subjects. The topics and images may make you feel uncomfortable at times, but
this is an opportunity for you to assess why they make you feel this way. They will likely cause you to question certain ideas and social mores. Keep the idea of
learning edges in mind as you view and process each text:
“Learning edges. We call the edge of our comfort zone the learning edge. When we are on the learning edge, we are most open to expanding
our knowledge and understanding—as well as expanding our comfort zone itself. Being on this edge means that we may feel annoyed, angry,
surprised, confused, defensive, or in some other way uncomfortable. These reactions are a natural part of the process of expanding our comfort
zones, and when we recognize them as such, we can use them as part of the learning process—signaling to us that we are at the learning edge,
ready to expand our knowledge and understanding. The challenge is to recognize when we are on a learning edge and then to stay there with
the discomfort we are experiencing to see what we can learn.”
–The Program on Intergroup Relations, University of Michigan, 2008.
Our classroom provides an open space for the critical and civil exchange of ideas. Some readings and other content in this course will include topics that some
students may find offensive and/or traumatizing. I’ll aim to warn students about potentially disturbing content and I ask all students to help to create an
atmosphere of mutual respect and sensitivity.
schedule Please note this is not an exhaustive list of the social injustices in the United States, nor globally. The hope is as this course continues to be taught, we
can continue to shed light on the experiences of the various historically excluded communities. Additionally, the schedule can be changed with fair notice in
order to best meet the needs of the class. For the most up-to-date readings, assignments, and due dates, always check Canvas.

land acknowledgment I would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on the Indigenous lands of Turtle Island, the ancestral name for what is now called
North America. Moreover, I would like to acknowledge the Alabama-Coushatta, Caddo, Carrizo &/Comecrudo, Coahuiltecan, Comanche, Kickapoo, Lipan
Apache, Tonkawa and Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, and all the American Indian and Indigenous Peoples and communities who have been or have become a part of
these lands and territories in Texas.
land engagements and commitments In recognition of the ongoing and cumulative challenges faced by Indigenous Peoples in Central Texas and globally,
we call upon The University of Texas at Austin to commit to the active recruitment and material support of Native American and Indigenous students, who
currently comprise fewer than 0.2% of UT Austin’s student body. Additionally, we call upon the University of Texas at Austin to establish a protocol of research
and study on Tribal or Native lands, and to foster ethics and practice of engaged scholarship, with and for Indigenous peoples and communities, locally and
internationally.

personal pronouns Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race,
culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name,
unless they have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center, which you can do so here:
http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-resources/. I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what
appears on the official roster, and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make
appropriate updates to my records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit
https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns.
grading policy As I hope you can see, flexibility is built into the assignments to support your success in this course. If you miss a smaller assignment or don’t
do as well on your earlier journal entries, your grade will not be impacted significantly. Consequently, the final grades are firm, and no additional curve is
available.

Introduction to Social Justice Informatics is a required course for the Social Justice Informatics concentration for Informatics majors. All Informatics majors must
earn a grade of at least C- in this course to graduate. If you receive a grade below C-, you will need to retake the course.
late work and makeups Late assignments will not be accepted unless the instructor approves the late submission ahead of time. If you become ill or
experience an emergency, please let the instructor know ASAP. Once the due date for an assignment has passed, it is more difficult for us to excuse late
assignments, but we definitely want to know if something is going on so we can work with you to give you the best opportunity to succeed in the class! There are
no makeups or assignment resubmissions. Please ask questions prior to the deadline if you are unsure of my expectations of the assignment. I will reserve 15-20
minutes each class for Housekeeping, in which I encourage you to ask any questions regarding assignments or overall timelines.
plagiarism Plagiarism simply will not be tolerated in class. Using someone else’s work in your own writing without giving proper credit is considered
plagiarism, a serious form of academic dishonesty that can result in severe penalties. Copying someone else’s work, buying a paper and submitting it as your
own, copying and pasting text (even with changes), or borrowing images from an online source, are some examples of plagiarism. Even if you plagiarize
accidentally, you can be held responsible and penalized. If you are found to have plagiarized an assignment, you will automatically receive a 0, no questions
asked. You will not be able to redo the assignment to recoup points missed.
Learning to cite sources appropriately is an important part of becoming a professional. When you are unsure about citation, you are encouraged to ask your
instructor (who is knowledgeable in the discipline) what is appropriate in the context of your assignment. Consultants at The University Writing Center can also
help you determine whether you are citing sources correctly—and they have helpful guides online for using direct quotations and paraphrasing. Reviewing those
skills will help you feel confident that you are handling sources professionally in your writing.
You can read the University’s definition of plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty in Sec. 11–402 of the Student Conduct Code. For more
information, visit the Dean of Students’site.
TurnItIn All assignments in this course may be processed by TurnItIn, a tool that compares submitted material to an archived database of published work to
check for potential plagiarism. Other methods may also be used to determine if a paper is the student's original work. Regardless of the results of any TurnItIn
submission, the faculty member will make the final determination as to whether or not a paper has been plagiarized.
absences Being present is critical to achieving our goals for this course. You are welcome to utilize one (2) class absences during the semester as needed
without explanation to me. In this case, you will be allowed to make up assignments or participation points you may have missed during this session. In addition
to participating in synchronous meetings, you can earn participation points through assignments and asynchronous discussions. However, please keep in mind
that if you miss multiple classes, you will begin to see a dip in your attendance and participation points.
University of Texas at Austin, School of Information
INF310J - Introduction to Social Justice Informatics - Smith - Spring 2022 Page 17 of 20
If you are absent on the day that your team meets, you are responsible for providing your team with the necessary information to compensate for your absence.
It is crucial to keep in communication with your team members; you are responsible for letting both us and your team know if you cannot make it to a class.
Excused Absence: Absences will be considered excused if they are for religious holidays or extenuating circumstances due to medical or family emergencies. If
you plan to miss class due to the observance of a religious holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will not be penalized for this absence,
although you will still be responsible for any work you will miss on that day if applicable. Check with us for details or arrangements.
If you have to be absent, use your resources wisely. Ask your team and other classmates to get a run-down and notes on any lessons you miss. If you find there
are topics that we covered while you were gone that raise questions, you may come by during office hours or schedule a meeting to discuss. Email specific
questions you have in advance so that we can make the most of our time. “What did I miss?” is not specific enough.

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a
sexual nature, dating/domestic violence, and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
University of Texas at Austin, School of Information
INF310J - Introduction to Social Justice Informatics - Smith - Spring 2022 Page 19 of 20
environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature occurs in our community, the university
can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, to report any information to the Title IX Office
regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive
any information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. I am a
Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX-related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or
with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX-related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you would like to speak with
someone who can provide support or remedies without making an official report to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more
information about reporting options and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call
512-471-0419.
Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are
required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer to as unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, including the types of conduct covered
under Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to support survivors.

Q Drop Policy
University of Texas at Austin, School of Information
INF310J - Introduction to Social Justice Informatics - Smith - Spring 2022 Page 20 of 20
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q
drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information about Q drops in general, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop.
University of Texas at Austin, School of Information",,"This course considers how justice theories can inform how information and communication technologies (ICTs) and communities can respond to implicit and
 explicit biases among historically excluded populations. It also critically reflects on existing orientations towards social justice with its commitments to punitive
 sanctions, and examines alternative approaches like restorative and transformative justice, which advocate for systems of accountability. Transformative justice
 seeks to replace harmful and ineffective institutions by developing social programs and creating alternative structures that center care, accountability, and healing.
 Organizational challenges include recognizing and proactively addressing racism, gender discrimination, and other forms of inequity in professional and
 academic environments. Many aspects of discrimination have long and deep histories. They have become structural, or part of a self-reproducing cycle. But it is
 important to recognize that they are not normal or natural, but instead the result of a history of injustice. In this course we take an action-oriented approach,
 focusing on identifying and addressing discrimination in its many realizations. We will draw from history and social science perspectives to better understand the
 forces and structures that support racism and other forms of discrimination, and the kinds of actions that are most effective against them.
 While this course, in its singularity, cannot eradicate all systems of oppression, this course seeks to equip students with the knowledge, critical thinking and
 evaluative skills necessary to better understand how systems of oppression disempower minoritized groups. We will explore human flourishing to counterbalance
 trauma-laden research and design practices often associated with minoritized groups. This course will help students acknowledge the full humanity of groups that
 have been reduced to deficits.
 INF310J - Introduction to Social Justice Informatics - Smith - Spring 2022 Page 2 of 20
 This course will explore questions such as,
 ● What would be a just socio-technical system for adjudicating and evaluating harm?
 ● What are the unintended consequences of not considering the fullness of BIPOC participants?
 ● How might we envision community intervention approaches to repair harm and healing for historically excluded populations?
 The field of informatics has an incredible impact on society these days. The potential benefits are great but so are its risks, especially if not enough attention is
 paid to its impacts on everyone, irrespective of race, class, gender, religion, geographic location, etc. Discrimination is both a technical, organizational, and
 systemic challenge. We will attempt to answer these questions by exploring specific steps of the design and implementation process as well as various
 methodological and theoretical approaches.
 In this course, we take an action-oriented approach, focusing on identifying and addressing discrimination in its many realizations in information and
 communication technologies. We will draw from historical and social science perspectives to better understand the forces and structures that support racism and
 other forms of discrimination (e.g. gender, ableism, gender identity, etc.), and the kinds of actions that are most effective against them.

 attendance and class participation (25%)
 discussion This course is student-centered. The vast majority of the learning in this class will occur within the classroom and via Canvas, you
 are required to attend class regularly and to complete all Canvas readings and assignments including all videos. Attendance will be taken during
 each class period. Absences will only be excused in situations following university policy (illness, family emergency, religious holy days,
 participation in University activities at the request of university authorities, and compelling absences beyond your control) with proper
 documentation and timely notification (prior to class for non-emergencies). Excessive tardiness may be considered as an unexcused absence
 except in situations following university policy. Attendance in asynchronous activities will be measured via Canvas.
 The quality of class discussion will be determined by what you put into it. Class participation is a critical element of this course. The
 effectiveness of the course will be significantly impacted by the quality of your participation. Class participation is not merely attendance, but
 rather factors in your overall contributions to the collaborative learning environment, based on both the quantity and quality of your
 interactions in all aspects of the course. Discussion of class participation with the instructor is encouraged in order to ensure that you are
 making the most of the classroom experience and the accompanying opportunities for learning. You are expected to participate in all aspects of
 class discussion.
 As you read or watch each course text, note what you find surprising. Come to each class with questions, ready to discuss what surprised you,
 to critique each text, and to discuss how each text relates to other course texts. Be prepared to contribute to all class discussions, including
 small-group activities, and bring your creativity. You may bring a laptop or tablet to class to take notes and to access readings, but please
 refrain from checking your email, social media, etc. At the close of every Wednesday class, we will do an activity, i like, i wish, what if…. This
 is a design activity, but it allows you to provide constructive feedback to improve the course as we move through it together.
 course texts You are expected to put time aside before each class to read/view ALL course texts, thoroughly. To help you prioritize, a number of texts are
 marked “k” to indicate that these are key course texts, while some texts in the syllabus are marked “sr” to indicate that you may skim-read these texts. Key course
 texts are texts that you are expected to read/view thoroughly and draw upon throughout the quarter. Skim-reading means making sure you get a sense of that
 text’s central arguments. Please note that we may assign some additional texts throughout the course.
 University of Texas at Austin, School of Information
 INF310J - Introduction to Social Justice Informatics - Smith - Spring 2022 Page 4 of 20
 discussion questions (10%) Each week, you will prepare and submit to Canvas a discussion question about the assigned reading for that week. Discussion
 questions are due in Canvas the day before class, at noon. The discussion question should be focused on one or more of the required readings and should make
 it clear that you have both read and thought about the assigned material. Your instructor will select a few of the discussion questions to guide the discussion of the
 week’s readings during. Discussion questions are an opportunity for you to bring your own particular point of view and interests to the material we cover in class,
 and you are encouraged to connect the material to current events and prior learning both in this class and other courses you may have taken. Discussion questions
 should be conversation starters. It might help for you to look for an idea or assertion in the reading that you found interesting and would like to talk to your peers
 about in class. Discussion questions should invite an interesting conversation, not just end in a simple yes or no answer.
 journal entries (20%) At the end of each week throughout the semester, with the aim of promoting deep reflection, you will post a Journal Entry to Canvas by
 5 PM each Friday, reflecting on course texts and/or class discussions from that week. There is no need to develop a formal argument. Stream-of-consciousness,
 informal prose, a list of questions, and bullet-points are all appropriate. Try to avoid “the pressure to be profound”; a Journal Entry should be simple and honest.
 If you respond to one another’s Journal Entries, please be respectful. There are 13 weeks in this semester and thus 13 possible journal entries; however, you are
 only required to complete 10 weeks (of your choosing) of journal entries.
 module assignments (30%) Throughout the semester, there will be 3 module assignments to synthesize the learnings and extend your critical thinking skills.
 For specifics of each assignment, please refer to the individual assignment page. Broadly speaking, Module Assignment #1 will have you exploring geospatial
 data to perform a demographic analysis, Module Assignment #2 pushes you into the design methodologies exploring participatory design, and Module
 Assignment #3 challenges you in a team design challenge. There are various ways to approach each Module Assignment, and we will dive in-depth as to what is
 required.
 course reflection (15%) At the end of the semester, you will submit a 1500 word final reflection, through which you will explore the meanings of the terms
 “social justice,” “human rights,” “information and communication technologies (ICTs),” and “harm”. Questions you might address: How should we define these
 terms? What are the differences and commonalities between them? How are these concepts connected? How have the course texts from the previous weeks
 related to these concepts? Further, expand your thinking into the latter half of this course in which we study and discuss the critiques and limitations of the design
 processes – including the ethical and political implication of social change – in what ways have your understandings and attitudes about social justice, human
 rights, ICTs, and harm shifted? How does designing for systemic social change compare to designing everyday objects? For the last part of your reflection,
 include some of the things you have learned throughout the semester. You might reflect on your experiences working on your in-class activities, Module
 Assignments, or you might reflect on the design process at a theoretical level. This paper is your opportunity to illustrate what you have learned, what you might
 be cynical about, and what questions you will take away with you.
 Do not summarize the course texts; focus on deep analysis. You may include in your reflection any lingering questions you have about these concepts and/or the
 course texts for the upcoming week. Please provide full citations, including for course texts. If you go beyond course texts, cite credible sources only.

 learning edges Please remain open to receiving and analyzing a wide variety of texts, many of which include portrayals of race, violence, questions of gender
 identity, sexuality in its many expressions, racism, and ‘other’ complex, nuanced subjects. The topics and images may make you feel uncomfortable at times, but
 this is an opportunity for you to assess why they make you feel this way. They will likely cause you to question certain ideas and social mores. Keep the idea of
 learning edges in mind as you view and process each text:
 “Learning edges. We call the edge of our comfort zone the learning edge. When we are on the learning edge, we are most open to expanding
 our knowledge and understanding—as well as expanding our comfort zone itself. Being on this edge means that we may feel annoyed, angry,
 surprised, confused, defensive, or in some other way uncomfortable. These reactions are a natural part of the process of expanding our comfort
 zones, and when we recognize them as such, we can use them as part of the learning process—signaling to us that we are at the learning edge,
 ready to expand our knowledge and understanding. The challenge is to recognize when we are on a learning edge and then to stay there with
 the discomfort we are experiencing to see what we can learn.”
 –The Program on Intergroup Relations, University of Michigan, 2008.
 Our classroom provides an open space for the critical and civil exchange of ideas. Some readings and other content in this course will include topics that some
 students may find offensive and/or traumatizing. I’ll aim to warn students about potentially disturbing content and I ask all students to help to create an
 atmosphere of mutual respect and sensitivity.
 schedule Please note this is not an exhaustive list of the social injustices in the United States, nor globally. The hope is as this course continues to be taught, we
 can continue to shed light on the experiences of the various historically excluded communities. Additionally, the schedule can be changed with fair notice in
 order to best meet the needs of the class. For the most up-to-date readings, assignments, and due dates, always check Canvas.

 land acknowledgment I would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on the Indigenous lands of Turtle Island, the ancestral name for what is now called
 North America. Moreover, I would like to acknowledge the Alabama-Coushatta, Caddo, Carrizo &/Comecrudo, Coahuiltecan, Comanche, Kickapoo, Lipan
 Apache, Tonkawa and Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, and all the American Indian and Indigenous Peoples and communities who have been or have become a part of
 these lands and territories in Texas.
 land engagements and commitments In recognition of the ongoing and cumulative challenges faced by Indigenous Peoples in Central Texas and globally,
 we call upon The University of Texas at Austin to commit to the active recruitment and material support of Native American and Indigenous students, who
 currently comprise fewer than 0.2% of UT Austin’s student body. Additionally, we call upon the University of Texas at Austin to establish a protocol of research
 and study on Tribal or Native lands, and to foster ethics and practice of engaged scholarship, with and for Indigenous peoples and communities, locally and
 internationally.

 personal pronouns Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race,
 culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name,
 unless they have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center, which you can do so here:
 http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-resources/. I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what
 appears on the official roster, and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make
 appropriate updates to my records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit
 https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns.
 grading policy As I hope you can see, flexibility is built into the assignments to support your success in this course. If you miss a smaller assignment or don’t
 do as well on your earlier journal entries, your grade will not be impacted significantly. Consequently, the final grades are firm, and no additional curve is
 available.

 Introduction to Social Justice Informatics is a required course for the Social Justice Informatics concentration for Informatics majors. All Informatics majors must
 earn a grade of at least C- in this course to graduate. If you receive a grade below C-, you will need to retake the course.
 late work and makeups Late assignments will not be accepted unless the instructor approves the late submission ahead of time. If you become ill or
 experience an emergency, please let the instructor know ASAP. Once the due date for an assignment has passed, it is more difficult for us to excuse late
 assignments, but we definitely want to know if something is going on so we can work with you to give you the best opportunity to succeed in the class! There are
 no makeups or assignment resubmissions. Please ask questions prior to the deadline if you are unsure of my expectations of the assignment. I will reserve 15-20
 minutes each class for Housekeeping, in which I encourage you to ask any questions regarding assignments or overall timelines.
 plagiarism Plagiarism simply will not be tolerated in class. Using someone else’s work in your own writing without giving proper credit is considered
 plagiarism, a serious form of academic dishonesty that can result in severe penalties. Copying someone else’s work, buying a paper and submitting it as your
 own, copying and pasting text (even with changes), or borrowing images from an online source, are some examples of plagia","This course considers how justice theories can inform how information and communication technologies (ICTs) and communities can respond to implicit and
 explicit biases among historically excluded populations. It also critically reflects on existing orientations towards social justice with its commitments to punitive
 sanctions, and examines alternative approaches like restorative and transformative justice, which advocate for systems of accountability. Transformative justice
 seeks to replace harmful and ineffective institutions by developing social programs and creating alternative structures that center care, accountability, and healing.
 Organizational challenges include recognizing and proactively addressing racism, gender discrimination, and other forms of inequity in professional and
 academic environments. Many aspects of discrimination have long and deep histories. They have become structural, or part of a self-reproducing cycle. But it is
 important to recognize that they are not normal or natural, but instead the result of a history of injustice. In this course we take an action-oriented approach,
 focusing on identifying and addressing discrimination in its many realizations. We will draw from history and social science perspectives to better understand the
 forces and structures that support racism and other forms of discrimination, and the kinds of actions that are most effective against them.
 While this course, in its singularity, cannot eradicate all systems of oppression, this course seeks to equip students with the knowledge, critical thinking and
 evaluative skills necessary to better understand how systems of oppression disempower minoritized groups. We will explore human flourishing to counterbalance
 trauma-laden research and design practices often associated with minoritized groups. This course will help students acknowledge the full humanity of groups that
 have been reduced to deficits.

 This course will explore questions such as,
 ● What would be a just socio-technical system for adjudicating and evaluating harm?
 ● What are the unintended consequences of not considering the fullness of BIPOC participants?
 ● How might we envision community intervention approaches to repair harm and healing for historically excluded populations?
 The field of informatics has an incredible impact on society these days. The potential benefits are great but so are its risks, especially if not enough attention is
 paid to its impacts on everyone, irrespective of race, class, gender, religion, geographic location, etc. Discrimination is both a technical, organizational, and
 systemic challenge. We will attempt to answer these questions by exploring specific steps of the design and implementation process as well as various
 methodological and theoretical approaches.
 In this course, we take an action-oriented approach, focusing on identifying and addressing discrimination in its many realizations in information and
 communication technologies. We will draw from historical and social science perspectives to better understand the forces and structures that support racism and
 other forms of discrimination (e.g. gender, ableism, gender identity, etc.), and the kinds of actions that are most effective against them.

 attendance and class participation (25%)
 discussion This course is student-centered. The vast majority of the learning in this class will occur within the classroom and via Canvas, you
 are required to attend class regularly and to complete all Canvas readings and assignments including all videos. Attendance will be taken during
 each class period. Absences will only be excused in situations following university policy (illness, family emergency, religious holy days,
 participation in University activities at the request of university authorities, and compelling absences beyond your control) with proper
 documentation and timely notification (prior to class for non-emergencies). Excessive tardiness may be considered as an unexcused absence
 except in situations following university policy. Attendance in asynchronous activities will be measured via Canvas.
 The quality of class discussion will be determined by what you put into it. Class participation is a critical element of this course. The
 effectiveness of the course will be significantly impacted by the quality of your participation. Class participation is not merely attendance, but
 rather factors in your overall contributions to the collaborative learning environment, based on both the quantity and quality of your
 interactions in all aspects of the course. Discussion of class participation with the instructor is encouraged in order to ensure that you are
 making the most of the classroom experience and the accompanying opportunities for learning. You are expected to participate in all aspects of
 class discussion.
 As you read or watch each course text, note what you find surprising. Come to each class with questions, ready to discuss what surprised you,
 to critique each text, and to discuss how each text relates to other course texts. Be prepared to contribute to all class discussions, including
 small-group activities, and bring your creativity. You may bring a laptop or tablet to class to take notes and to access readings, but please
 refrain from checking your email, social media, etc. At the close of every Wednesday class, we will do an activity, i like, i wish, what if…. This
 is a design activity, but it allows you to provide constructive feedback to improve the course as we move through it together.
 course texts You are expected to put time aside before each class to read/view ALL course texts, thoroughly. To help you prioritize, a number of texts are
 marked “k” to indicate that these are key course texts, while some texts in the syllabus are marked “sr” to indicate that you may skim-read these texts. Key course
 texts are texts that you are expected to read/view thoroughly and draw upon throughout the quarter. Skim-reading means making sure you get a sense of that
 text’s central arguments. Please note that we may assign some additional texts throughout the course.

 INF310J - Introduction to Social Justice Informatics  - Spring 2022 Page 4 of 20
 discussion questions (10%) Each week, you will prepare and submit to Canvas a discussion question about the assigned reading for that week. Discussion
 questions are due in Canvas the day before class, at noon. The discussion question should be focused on one or more of the required readings and should make
 it clear that you have both read and thought about the assigned material. Your instructor will select a few of the discussion questions to guide the discussion of the
 week’s readings during. Discussion questions are an opportunity for you to bring your own particular point of view and interests to the material we cover in class,
 and you are encouraged to connect the material to current events and prior learning both in this class and other courses you may have taken. Discussion questions
 should be conversation starters. It might help for you to look for an idea or assertion in the reading that you found interesting and would like to talk to your peers
 about in class. Discussion questions should invite an interesting conversation, not just end in a simple yes or no answer.
 journal entries (20%) At the end of each week throughout the semester, with the aim of promoting deep reflection, you will post a Journal Entry to Canvas by
 5 PM each Friday, reflecting on course texts and/or class discussions from that week. There is no need to develop a formal argument. Stream-of-consciousness,
 informal prose, a list of questions, and bullet-points are all appropriate. Try to avoid “the pressure to be profound”; a Journal Entry should be simple and honest.
 If you respond to one another’s Journal Entries, please be respectful. There are 13 weeks in this semester and thus 13 possible journal entries; however, you are
 only required to complete 10 weeks (of your choosing) of journal entries.
 module assignments (30%) Throughout the semester, there will be 3 module assignments to synthesize the learnings and extend your critical thinking skills.
 For specifics of each assignment, please refer to the individual assignment page. Broadly speaking, Module Assignment #1 will have you exploring geospatial
 data to perform a demographic analysis, Module Assignment #2 pushes you into the design methodologies exploring participatory design, and Module
 Assignment #3 challenges you in a team design challenge. There are various ways to approach each Module Assignment, and we will dive in-depth as to what is
 required.
 course reflection (15%) At the end of the semester, you will submit a 1500 word final reflection, through which you will explore the meanings of the terms
 “social justice,” “human rights,” “information and communication technologies (ICTs),” and “harm”. Questions you might address: How should we define these
 terms? What are the differences and commonalities between them? How are these concepts connected? How have the course texts from the previous weeks
 related to these concepts? Further, expand your thinking into the latter half of this course in which we study and discuss the critiques and limitations of the design
 processes – including the ethical and political implication of social change – in what ways have your understandings and attitudes about social justice, human
 rights, ICTs, and harm shifted? How does designing for systemic social change compare to designing everyday objects? For the last part of your reflection,
 include some of the things you have learned throughout the semester. You might reflect on your experiences working on your in-class activities, Module
 Assignments, or you might reflect on the design process at a theoretical level. This paper is your opportunity to illustrate what you have learned, what you might
 be cynical about, and what questions you will take away with you.
 Do not summarize the course texts; focus on deep analysis. You may include in your reflection any lingering questions you have about these concepts and/or the
 course texts for the upcoming week. Please provide full citations, including for course texts. If you go beyond course texts, cite credible sources only.

 learning edges Please remain open to receiving and analyzing a wide variety of texts, many of which include portrayals of race, violence, questions of gender
 identity, sexuality in its many expressions, racism, and ‘other’ complex, nuanced subjects. The topics and images may make you feel uncomfortable at times, but
 this is an opportunity for you to assess why they make you feel this way. They will likely cause you to question certain ideas and social mores. Keep the idea of
 learning edges in mind as you view and process each text:
 “Learning edges. We call the edge of our comfort zone the learning edge. When we are on the learning edge, we are most open to expanding
 our knowledge and understanding—as well as expanding our comfort zone itself. Being on this edge means that we may feel annoyed, angry,
 surprised, confused, defensive, or in some other way uncomfortable. These reactions are a natural part of the process of expanding our comfort
 zones, and when we recognize them as such, we can use them as part of the learning process—signaling to us that we are at the learning edge,
 ready to expand our knowledge and understanding. The challenge is to recognize when we are on a learning edge and then to stay there with
 the discomfort we are experiencing to see what we can learn.”
 –The Program on Intergroup Relations.
 Our classroom provides an open space for the critical and civil exchange of ideas. Some readings and other content in this course will include topics that some
 students may find offensive and/or traumatizing. I’ll aim to warn students about potentially disturbing content and I ask all students to help to create an
 atmosphere of mutual respect and sensitivity.
 schedule Please note this is not an exhaustive list of the social injustices in the United States, nor globally. The hope is as this course continues to be taught, we
 can continue to shed light on the experiences of the various historically excluded communities. Additionally, the schedule can be changed with fair notice in
 order to best meet the needs of the class. For the most up-to-date readings, assignments, and due dates, always check Canvas.

 classroom statements and policies
 land acknowledgment I would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on the Indigenous lands of Turtle Island, the ancestral name for what is now called
 North America. Moreover, I would like to acknowledge the and all the American Indian and Indigenous Peoples and communities who have been or have become a part of
 these lands and territories in Texas.
 land engagements and commitments In recognition of the ongoing and cumulative challenges faced by Indigenous Peoples in Central Texas and globally,
 we call upon The University of Texas at Austin to commit to the active recruitment and material support of Native American and Indigenous students, who
 currently comprise fewer than 0.2% of UT Austin’s student body. Additionally, we call upon the University of Texas at Austin to establish a protocol of research
 and study on Tribal or Native lands, and to foster ethics and practice of engaged scholarship, with and for Indigenous peoples and communities, locally and
 internationally.

 statement on learning success Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need to be adaptable because we all learn differently. If there are
 aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your
 needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student resources available through UT. Many are listed on this syllabus, but I
 am happy to connect you with a person or Center if you would like.
 statement on flexibility In acknowledgment of COVID 19 and its impact on the University of Texas at Austin community, this course will reaffirm one of the
 core values here at UT Austin: responsibility. Our responsibility to ourselves and each other is to put our humanity at the forefront of our academic pursuits. With
 that being said, this semester I commit to being adaptable in this time of great need, which is reflected in the course policies below around attendance, grading,
 and assignments/exams.
 If you experience any hardships such as illness, accident, family crisis please know that these policies may be amended and therefore you should communicate
 with me as soon as you feel comfortable doing so. If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing with me, please visit Student Emergency Services.
 For additional campus resources, please visit protect.utexas.edu.

 personal pronouns Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race,
 culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name,
 unless they have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center, which you can do so here:
 http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-resources/. I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what
 appears on the official roster, and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make
 appropriate updates to my records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit
 https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns.
 grading policy As I hope you can see, flexibility is built into the assignments to support your success in this course. If you miss a smaller assignment or don’t
 do as well on your earlier journal entries, your grade will not be impacted significantly. Consequently, the final grades are firm, and no additional curve is
 available.

 Introduction to Social Justice Informatics is a required course for the Social Justice Informatics concentration for Informatics majors. All Informatics majors must
 earn a grade of at least C- in this course to graduate. If you receive a grade below C-, you will need to retake the course.
 late work and makeups Late assignments will not be accepted unless the instructor approves the late submission ahead of time. If you become ill or
 experience an emergency, please let the instructor know ASAP. Once the due date for an assignment has passed, it is more difficult for us to excuse late
 assignments, but we definitely want to know if something is going on so we can work with you to give you the best opportunity to succeed in the class! There are
 no makeups or assignment resubmissions. Please ask questions prior to the deadline if you are unsure of my expectations of the assignment. I will reserve 15-20
 minutes each class for Housekeeping, in which I encourage you to ask any questions regarding assignments or overall timelines.
 plagiarism Plagiarism simply will not be tolerated in class. Using someone else’s work in your own writing without giving proper credit is considered
 plagiarism, a serious form of academic dishonesty that can result in severe penalties. Copying someone else’s work, buying a paper and submitting it as your
 own, copying and pasting text (even with changes), or borrowing images from an online source, are some examples of plagia","['course', 'considers', 'justice', 'theory', 'inform', 'information',

Course Description
Social media platforms have enabled millions of people to contribute their own information to web enabled systems.
This course will prepare students to grapple with and analyze this information as they explore questions at the
intersection of computational systems and social behavior. Student projects will focus on studying real-world
challenges and opportunities in current social media platforms by analyzing the large amounts of data people leave
behind in these platforms, applying both computational and qualitative techniques to explore this data. Readings and
discussions will help students reason about the ethics of working with this kind of data and how to approach it from a
more human-centered perspective.
What will I learn?
After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
• Collect, clean and explore social media data from platforms like Twitter
• Analyze online social media data from a human-centered data science perspective — i.e., a perspective
that emphasizes the humanity and agency of those represented in the data
• Communicate data science results in both written and oral formats using appropriate and compelling
visualization to support data stories pertaining to social media
• Assess and understand some of the key ethical and research issues involved in working with social media
data
How will I learn?
This is a project-style course that will meet for 90 minutes on Wednesdays and Fridays. Activities on Wednesdays
will focus on learning for your project and will include building a shared understanding of assigned readingsthrough
small group discussions and occasional short video/audio lecture presentations. Activities on Fridays will focus on
learning from your project and will prioritize working and reflecting on project components in a hands-on setting.
This mix will allow us to achieve our learning objectives as we collectively navigate a global pandemic.

Pre-requisites for the course
There are no formal prerequisites for this course. In terms of the required skills, students need be proficient in
programming and comfortable programming in python. You are expected to quickly learn many new things. For
example, your project will require you to fetch Twitter data using the Twitter API or analyze posts from Reddit using
pre-existing libraries (like python nltk, scipy), which should not be too challenging if you already know high-level
languages like Python. Please make sure you are comfortable with this.
How to succeed in this course
Here are three things you can do that will help you succeed in this course:
• Be a co-designer! This course is new and in the spirit of participatory and human-centered design, we will
be making some decisions about the pace and exact direction of the course together. Being open to
collaboration with me, advocating for what’s interesting to you and taking ownership of your own learning
will be crucial.
• Show up! This course is based on interactive flipped classroom pedagogical models, so participation in class
is critical to individual success and to the success of the course as a whole. I have very strong expectations
of participation. I reserve the right to reduce a student’s grade if they do not meet my expectations around
participation.
• Do the assigned readings and activities. Not having done so will make you a less effective participant in
discussions. Moreover, this course will follow the design principle that your instructor should not be your
first point of contact with new material. My responsibility will be to help you troubleshoot your
understanding so the questions you show up with will matter.
Course Requirements
Required Materials
You do not have to buy any text books for this course. All readings will be uploaded online on Canvas. In addition,
I will provide links to additional and supporting readings as needed and appropriate.
You do not need to buy any software. On the practical side, you would need to have python and Jupyter notebook,
installed on your computer. At various times I will ask you to install different packages, download datasets, etc. All
of these will be open sourced and you do not have to buy anything.
Finally, you will need to apply for a Twitter Developer Account to access the Twitter collection APIs. I would advise
submitting an application as soon as you realize you are interested in taking this course. Don’t wait for the first day
of class.
Required Devices
You will need a laptop computer capable of going online and running a Google Colab Notebook.
Course expectations
As the instructor, I expect:
• A commitment to engaged learning from every student. This includes being present and actively involved in
our class sessions. I reserve the right to reduce student grades if this expectation is not met
3
• Students to act, think, and communicate with generosity and patience, and in productive and professional
way
• Students to take an active role in helping shape this course because it is new
• This classroom to be a brave space for all of us to learn, explore, and discuss; while we might be dealing
with power, difficult topics, and differing values, we remain respectful of others’ views and experiences
Students can expect from the instructor:
• Engaged, active instruction on course content
• Quick responses to questions via email: within 24 hours during the week, and 48 hours on weekends
• Timely feedback on all assignments, which is usually 2 weeks from the due date
• A significant amount of autonomy regarding the material we cover and the topics we discuss.

Course Activities
A. Reading Engagements (20% of grade)
During each class meeting (weeks 1-14), we will discuss the readings and activities that were assigned for that
week. Prior to each class, you will have to:
1. Think about what came up for you in terms of what you found interesting, hard, provocative, stressful
etc. Anything that you think would generate conversation in the group is fair game.
2. Go to a shared document for the session (a google slide-deck). Claim one page and use it as a canvas –
populate it with words or images that will help the group think about the reading from your
perspective. This could be your perspective on what is important in the reading, how you engaged with
the reading, something concrete that you think we should investigate or some thoughts you’d like to
share about yourself that are brought to your mind based on the read. We will leverage these pages in
our class discussions.
4
3. Please note that an important part of your reading engagement is being “present” to discuss your
response.
You will also be maintaining a project ‘logbook’ that is shared with me. You will periodically be asked to make short
personal entries about what going’s well and what you need help with.
B. Project (50% of grade)
Students will work individually or collectively (depending on enrollment) on a class project that will invite you to
identify an interesting question that you can address by analyzing social media data using exploratory mixedmethods. There will be several milestones for this project that you will be required to meet, and you will present
your work several times to get feedback on your progress. The project is worth 50% of your grade, divided across
the milestones. You will generally be following the data science process as you go through these phases.
• Milestone 1: submission 10% - concentrates on ideation and developing a proposal for what data to collect
and the initial questions to ask from it
• Milestone 2 submission 10% - focuses on data collection and some basic preliminary analysis
• Milestone 3 submission 10% - focuses on processing, visualizing, and analyzing data using GEPHI
• Milestone 4 submission 10% - focuses on interpretive analysis. Builds on network visualizations to drill into
interesting features of the data using qualitative techniques
• Milestone 5 finale submission 10% - builds on earlier phases and focuses on the final steps of analyzing,
interpreting, reporting findings, and wrapping up your project
Here’s an overview of the project requirements:
• Problem:
o Creative, interesting questions, on a domain topic of interest to the student. Your initial set of ideas
submitted during the project idea generation submission is a starting point.
• Data:
o Should involve data scraped or gathered from the web.
o Should be a sufficiently large amount of data to answer interesting non-trivial questions.
o Should involve bringing together multiple kinds of data, to enable analysis of interesting novel
relationships.
o NOTE: You need to start on the data collection step early and make sure to not spend more than 2
weeks on data collection.
• Process:
o Should involve exploratory, mixed-methods analysis, and should demonstrate creativity, depth, and
thoroughness in your analysis.
o NOTE: You should not be only presenting summary statistics of whatever data that you have
collected. Non-trivial analysis is necessary to score points for the data analytics and processing part.
o Should make use of a variety of visual and analytical methods (it is not required that you use all the
methods covered in class).
• Report:
o Should present insightful answers to interesting non-trivial questions.
o Should justify your findings with evidence.
o Should present findings clearly and convincingly. Should make use of visuals.
C. Reflections (10% of grade)
5
We will be engaging in 3 reflection activities over the semester. You will write short reflections about your learning
experiences (e.g. what’s been surprising, muddy, frustrating etc). The aim is essentially to reflect on one or more of
the following topics:
• Your response to one or more of the readings
• Your response to classroom discussion
• Your reflection on some aspect(s) of the week's topics not covered by the above
These reflections are intended to help you step outside your experiences, make sense of them and inform future
learning.
D. Assignments (20% of grade)
You will have 3-4 individual homework assignments. The goal of these assignments is to help you practice some of
the skills you will apply in your projects. Collaboration on these assignments can be useful, and I encourage it, but
each student must turn in an individual write-up in their own words as well as code/work that is their
own. Regardless of whether you work with others, what you turn in must be your own work; this includes code
and interpretation of results.
E. Dialog with the instructor (ungraded)
I will meet with each member of the class individually at least three times during the semester. The first meeting
(30 minutes long) will take place during the first two weeks of the course. This meeting is meant to allow us to get
to know one another--more than the ""normal"" classroom setting usually permits. I am eager to hear what you're
hoping to accomplish in the iSchool, what you're hoping to do afterwards, and also to answer any questions you
might have--about the course, about me, or about anything else.
The second meeting will take place during the middle of the semester. This is meant to allow us to discuss your
project and participation. The third meeting will take place towards the end of the semester to discuss what you
learned in the course, and your suggestions for improving the course in the future. I will also ask you for input on
your final grade.
Course Outline
All instructions, assignments, readings, rubrics and essential information will be on the Canvas website. Check the
site regularly and use it to ask questions about the course schedule.
Changes to the schedule may be made at my discretion and if circumstances require. For example, we might want
to slow down, speed up or drop certain topics depending on student input. It is your responsibility to note these
changes when announced (although I will do my best to ensure that you receive the changes with as much
advanced notice as possible).

Policies
Classroom Policies
Statement on Learning Success
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need to be adaptable because we all learn differently. If there
are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible.
Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you
to reach out to the student resources available through UT. Many are listed on this syllabus, but I am happy to connect
you with a person or Center if you would like.
Statement on Flexibility
In acknowledgement of COVID 19 and its impact on the University of Texas at Austin community, this course will reaffirm
one of the core values here at UT Austin: responsibility. Our responsibility to ourselves and each other is to put our
humanity in the forefront of our academic pursuits. With that being said, this semester I commit to being adaptable in
this time of great need, which is reflected in the course policies below around attendance, grading, and
assignments/exams.
If you experience any hardships such as illness, accident, family crisis please know that these policies may be amended
and therefore you should communicate with me as soon as you feel comfortable doing so. If for any reason you do not
feel comfortable discussing with me, please visit Student Emergency Services.
For additional campus resources, please visit https://coronavirus.utexas.edu/students.
Grading Policies
Grades in graduate school are necessarily crude. The most important outcomes should be what you learn, how it impacts
what you want to study or do in the future, and your ability to think clearly and express your ideas and research activities
logically. This course uses the iSchool Standard Grading Scheme, which converts percentage grades into 4.0 grades (see
below). You will receive a decimal grade for this class. General grading information for undergraduate students is available
in the University’s General Information Catalog.
Grade Cutoff Points needed
A 94% 940
A- 90% 900
B+ 87% 870
B 84% 840
B- 80% 800
C+ 77% 770
C 74% 740
C- 70% 700
D 65% 650
F <65% <650
Your written work will be graded based on its clarity, organization, balance, amount of pertinent detail included, depth
and clarity of evaluative and analytical comments, and preparation. It will also be graded on the extent to which a good
understanding of the material presented in the course is shown and on the extent to which directions are followed. If 
10
evaluative or analytical comments are required, they should be supported by factual evidence, either from readings or
other documents. Other aspects of individual assignments may also be included in the grading.
Written work that shows a lack of understanding of subject matter, is unclear or poorly organized, contains few or
irrelevant details, does not follow directions, contains little or unsubstantiated evaluative commentary, or is poorly
written, prepared (e.g. typos, grammatical errors), or documented will receive low grades.
Students are encouraged to take drafts of their writing assignments to the University Writing Center for assistance.
Information on scheduling an appointment can be found here (Links to an external site.).
Evaluation of Student Work: You may expect to receive comments on and evaluations of assignments and submitted work
in a timely fashion. All work from the course will be returned, with comments, within two weeks of the last class of the
semester.
Late Assignments: Late assignments will receive reduced credit, unless the student has made prior arrangements with the
instructor.

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault,
unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded
educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature occurs in our
community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved
in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, report any
information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed
to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not
limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. I am a Responsible
Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before
talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a
responsible employee. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making an
official report to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options
and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call
512-471-0419. 
13
Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory
reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer to as unprofessional or
inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, including the types of conduct covered under Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX
office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to support survivors.

Q Drop Policy (modified for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters)
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline,
which typically occurs near the middle of the semester, but has been extended for the spring 2021 semester to May
11. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution—
however, for the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, all Q-drops will be considered “non-academic,” which allows
students to drop a class without counting toward the six-class limit. For more information about Q drops in general,
see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop. For information about fall 2020 and spring 2021
updates to the Q Drop Policy, see: https://t.e2ma.net/message/r3htee/j51jb0.
Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit Grading Policy
For the spring 2021 semester, undergraduate students may choose to have a total of three (3) classes graded on a
Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit basis without penalty. These exceptions are new and apply only to the fall 2020 and
spring 2021 semesters. For more information please visit UT's policy on the Extended deadline for Q-drops and P/F

 Course Description
 Social media platforms have enabled millions of people to contribute their own information to web enabled systems.
 This course will prepare students to grapple with and analyze this information as they explore questions at the
 intersection of computational systems and social behavior. Student projects will focus on studying real-world
 challenges and opportunities in current social media platforms by analyzing the large amounts of data people leave
 behind in these platforms, applying both computational and qualitative techniques to explore this data. Readings and
 discussions will help students reason about the ethics of working with this kind of data and how to approach it from a
 more human-centered perspective.
 What will I learn?
 After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
 • Collect, clean and explore social media data from platforms like Twitter
 • Analyze online social media data from a human-centered data science perspective — i.e., a perspective
 that emphasizes the humanity and agency of those represented in the data
 • Communicate data science results in both written and oral formats using appropriate and compelling
 visualization to support data stories pertaining to social media
 • Assess and understand some of the key ethical and research issues involved in working with social media
 data
 How will I learn?
 This is a project-style course that will meet for 90 minutes on Wednesdays and Fridays. Activities on Wednesdays
 will focus on learning for your project and will include building a shared understanding of assigned readingsthrough
 small group discussions and occasional short video/audio lecture presentations. Activities on Fridays will focus on
 learning from your project and will prioritize working and reflecting on project components in a hands-on setting.
 This mix will allow us to achieve our learning objectives as we collectively navigate a global pandemic.
 2
 Pre-requisites for the course
 There are no formal prerequisites for this course. In terms of the required skills, students need be proficient in
 programming and comfortable programming in python. You are expected to quickly learn many new things. For
 example, your project will require you to fetch Twitter data using the Twitter API or analyze posts from Reddit using
 pre-existing libraries (like python nltk, scipy), which should not be too challenging if you already know high-level
 languages like Python. Please make sure you are comfortable with this.
 How to succeed in this course
 Here are three things you can do that will help you succeed in this course:
 • Be a co-designer! This course is new and in the spirit of participatory and human-centered design, we will
 be making some decisions about the pace and exact direction of the course together. Being open to
 collaboration with me, advocating for what’s interesting to you and taking ownership of your own learning
 will be crucial.
 • Show up! This course is based on interactive flipped classroom pedagogical models, so participation in class
 is critical to individual success and to the success of the course as a whole. I have very strong expectations
 of participation. I reserve the right to reduce a student’s grade if they do not meet my expectations around
 participation.
 • Do the assigned readings and activities. Not having done so will make you a less effective participant in
 discussions. Moreover, this course will follow the design principle that your instructor should not be your
 first point of contact with new material. My responsibility will be to help you troubleshoot your
 understanding so the questions you show up with will matter.
 Course Requirements
 Required Materials
 You do not have to buy any text books for this course. All readings will be uploaded online on Canvas. In addition,
 I will provide links to additional and supporting readings as needed and appropriate.
 You do not need to buy any software. On the practical side, you would need to have python and Jupyter notebook,
 installed on your computer. At various times I will ask you to install different packages, download datasets, etc. All
 of these will be open sourced and you do not have to buy anything.
 Finally, you will need to apply for a Twitter Developer Account to access the Twitter collection APIs. I would advise
 submitting an application as soon as you realize you are interested in taking this course. Don’t wait for the first day
 of class.
 Required Devices
 You will need a laptop computer capable of going online and running a Google Colab Notebook.
 Course expectations
 As the instructor, I expect:
 • A commitment to engaged learning from every student. This includes being present and actively involved in
 our class sessions. I reserve the right to reduce student grades if this expectation is not met
 3
 • Students to act, think, and communicate with generosity and patience, and in productive and professional
 way
 • Students to take an active role in helping shape this course because it is new
 • This classroom to be a brave space for all of us to learn, explore, and discuss; while we might be dealing
 with power, difficult topics, and differing values, we remain respectful of others’ views and experiences
 Students can expect from the instructor:
 • Engaged, active instruction on course content
 • Quick responses to questions via email: within 24 hours during the week, and 48 hours on weekends
 • Timely feedback on all assignments, which is usually 2 weeks from the due date
 • A significant amount of autonomy regarding the material we cover and the topics we discuss.

 Course Activities
 A. Reading Engagements (20% of grade)
 During each class meeting (weeks 1-14), we will discuss the readings and activities that were assigned for that
 week. Prior to each class, you will have to:
 1. Think about what came up for you in terms of what you found interesting, hard, provocative, stressful
 etc. Anything that you think would generate conversation in the group is fair game.
 2. Go to a shared document for the session (a google slide-deck). Claim one page and use it as a canvas –
 populate it with words or images that will help the group think about the reading from your
 perspective. This could be your perspective on what is important in the reading, how you engaged with
 the reading, something concrete that you think we should investigate or some thoughts you’d like to
 share about yourself that are brought to your mind based on the read. We will leverage these pages in
 our class discussions.
 4
 3. Please note that an important part of your reading engagement is being “present” to discuss your
 response.
 You will also be maintaining a project ‘logbook’ that is shared with me. You will periodically be asked to make short
 personal entries about what going’s well and what you need help with.
 B. Project (50% of grade)
 Students will work individually or collectively (depending on enrollment) on a class project that will invite you to
 identify an interesting question that you can address by analyzing social media data using exploratory mixedmethods. There will be several milestones for this project that you will be required to meet, and you will present
 your work several times to get feedback on your progress. The project is worth 50% of your grade, divided across
 the milestones. You will generally be following the data science process as you go through these phases.
 • Milestone 1: submission 10% - concentrates on ideation and developing a proposal for what data to collect
 and the initial questions to ask from it
 • Milestone 2 submission 10% - focuses on data collection and some basic preliminary analysis
 • Milestone 3 submission 10% - focuses on processing, visualizing, and analyzing data using GEPHI
 • Milestone 4 submission 10% - focuses on interpretive analysis. Builds on network visualizations to drill into
 interesting features of the data using qualitative techniques
 • Milestone 5 finale submission 10% - builds on earlier phases and focuses on the final steps of analyzing,
 interpreting, reporting findings, and wrapping up your project
 Here’s an overview of the project requirements:
 • Problem:
 o Creative, interesting questions, on a domain topic of interest to the student. Your initial set of ideas
 submitted during the project idea generation submission is a starting point.
 • Data:
 o Should involve data scraped or gathered from the web.
 o Should be a sufficiently large amount of data to answer interesting non-trivial questions.
 o Should involve bringing together multiple kinds of data, to enable analysis of interesting novel
 relationships.
 o NOTE: You need to start on the data collection step early and make sure to not spend more than 2
 weeks on data collection.
 • Process:
 o Should involve exploratory, mixed-methods analysis, and should demonstrate creativity, depth, and
 thoroughness in your analysis.
 o NOTE: You should not be only presenting summary statistics of whatever data that you have
 collected. Non-trivial analysis is necessary to score points for the data analytics and processing part.
 o Should make use of a variety of visual and analytical methods (it is not required that you use all the
 methods covered in class).
 • Report:
 o Should present insightful answers to interesting non-trivial questions.
 o Should justify your findings with evidence.
 o Should present findings clearly and convincingly. Should make use of visuals.
 C. Reflections (10% of grade)
 5
 We will be engaging in 3 reflection activities over the semester. You will write short reflections about your learning
 experiences (e.g. what’s been surprising, muddy, frustrating etc). The aim is essentially to reflect on one or more of
 the following topics:
 • Your response to one or more of the readings
 • Your response to classroom discussion
 • Your reflection on some aspect(s) of the week's topics not covered by the above
 These reflections are intended to help you step outside your experiences, make sense of them and inform future
 learning.
 D. Assignments (20% of grade)
 You will have 3-4 individual homework assignments. The goal of these assignments is to help you practice some of
 the skills you will apply in your projects. Collaboration on these assignments can be useful, and I encourage it, but
 each student must turn in an individual write-up in their own words as well as code/work that is their
 own. Regardless of whether you work with others, what you turn in must be your own work; this includes code
 and interpretation of results.
 E. Dialog with the instructor (ungraded)
 I will meet with each member of the class individually at least three times during the semester. The first meeting
 (30 minutes long) will take place during the first two weeks of the course. This meeting is meant to allow us to get
 to know one another--more than the ""normal"" classroom setting usually permits. I am eager to hear what you're
 hoping to accomplish in the iSchool, what you're hoping to do afterwards, and also to answer any questions you
 might have--about the course, about me, or about anything else.
 The second meeting will take place during the middle of the semester. This is meant to allow us to discuss your
 project and participation. The third meeting will take place towards the end of the semester to discuss what you
 learned in the course, and your suggestions for improving the course in the future. I will also ask you for input on
 your final grade.
 Course Outline
 All instructions, assignments, readings, rubrics and essential information will be on the Canvas website. Check the
 site regularly and use it to ask questions about the course schedule.
 Changes to the schedule may be made at my discretion and if circumstances require. For example, we might want
 to slow down, speed up or drop certain topics depending on student input. It is your responsibility to note these
 changes when announced (although I will do my best to ensure that you receive the changes with as much
 advanced notice as possible).

 Policies
 Classroom Policies
 Statement on Learning Success
 Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need to be adaptable because we all learn differently. If there
 are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible.
 Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you
 to reach out to the student resources available through UT. Many are listed on this syllabus, but I am happy to connect
 you with a person or Center if you would like.
 Statement on Flexibility
 In acknowledgement of COVID 19 and its impact on the University of Texas at Austin community, this course will reaffirm
 one of the core values here at UT Austin: responsibility. Our responsibility to ourselves and each other is to put our
 humanity in the forefront of our academic pursuits. With that being said, this semester I commit to being adaptable in
 this time of great need, which is reflected in the course policies below around attendance, grading, and
 assignments/exams.
 If you experience any hardships such as illness, accident, family crisis please know that these policies may be amended
 and therefore you should communicate with me as soon as you feel comfortable doing so. If for any reason you do not
 feel comfortable discussing with me, please visit Student Emergency Services.
 For additional campus resources, please visit https://coronavirus.utexas.edu/students.
 Grading Policies
 Grades in graduate school are necessarily crude. The most important outcomes should be what you learn, how it impacts
 what you want to study or do in the future, and your ability to think clearly and express your ideas and research activities
 logically. This course uses the iSchool Standard Grading Scheme, which converts percentage grades into 4.0 grades (see
 below). You will receive a decimal grade for this class. General grading information for undergraduate students is available
 in the University’s General Information Catalog.
 Grade Cutoff Points needed
 A 94% 940
 A- 90% 900
 B+ 87% 870
 B 84% 840
 B- 80% 800
 C+ 77% 770
 C 74% 740
 C- 70% 700
 D 65% 650
 F <65% <650
 Your written work will be graded based on its clarity, organization, balance, amount of pertinent detail included, depth
 and clarity of evaluative and analytical comments, and preparation. It will also be graded on the extent to which a good
 understanding of the material presented in the course is shown and on the extent to which directions are followed. If 
 10
 evaluative or analytical comments are required, they should be supported by factual evidence, either from readings or
 other documents. Other aspects of individual assignments may also be included in the grading.
 Written work that shows a lack of understanding of subject matter, is unclear or poorly organized, contains few or
 irrelevant details, does not follow directions, contains little or unsubstantiated evaluative commentary, or is poorly
 written, prepared (e.g. typos, grammatical errors), or documented will receive low grades.
 Students are encouraged to take drafts of their writing assignments to the University Writing Center for assistance.
 Information on scheduling an appointment can be found here (Links to an external site.).
 Evaluation of Student Work: You may expect to receive comments on and evaluations of assignments and submitted work
 in a timely fashion. All work from the course will be returned, with comments, within two weeks of the last class of the
 semester.
 Late Assignments: Late assignments will receive reduced credit, unless the student has made prior arrangements with the
 instructor.

 Title IX Reporting
 Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault,
 unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded
 educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
 discrimination in all its forms. When unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature occurs in our
 community, the university can:
 1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
 2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved
 in a Title IX investigation.
 3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
 Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, report any
 information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed
 to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not
 limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. I am a Responsible
 Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before
 talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a
 responsible employee. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making an
 official report to the university, please email For more information about reporting options
 and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at or call
 512-471-0419. 
 13
 Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory
 reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer to as unprofessional or
 inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, including the types of conduct covered under Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX
 office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to support survivors.

 Q Drop Policy (modified for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters)
 If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline,
 which typically occurs near the middle of the semester, but has been extended for the spring 2021 semester to May
 11. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution—
 however, for the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, all Q-drops will be considered “non-academic,” which allows
 students to drop a class without counting toward the six-class limit. For more information about Q drops in general,
 see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop. For information about fall 2020 and spring 2021
 updates to the Q Drop Policy, see: https://t.e2ma.net/message/r3htee/j51jb0.
 Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit Grading Policy
 For the spring 2021 semester, undergraduate students may choose to have a total of three (3) classes graded on a
 Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit basis without penalty. These exceptions are new and apply only to the fall 2020 and
 spring 2021 semesters. For more information please visit UT's policy on the Extended deadline for Q-drops and P/F

 Course Description
 Social media platforms have enabled millions of people to contribute their own information to web enabled systems.
 This course will prepare students to grapple with and analyze this information as they explore questions at the
 intersection of computational systems and social behavior. Student projects will focus on studying real-world
 challenges and opportunities in current social media platforms by analyzing the large amounts of data people leave
 behind in these platforms, applying both computational and qualitative techniques to explore this data. Readings and
 discussions will help students reason about the ethics of working with this kind of data and how to approach it from a
 more human-centered perspective.
 What will I learn?
 After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
 • Collect, clean and explore social media data from platforms like Twitter
 • Analyze online social media data from a human-centered data science perspective — i.e., a perspective
 that emphasizes the humanity and agency of those represented in the data
 • Communicate data science results in both written and oral formats using appropriate and compelling
 visualization to support data stories pertaining to social media
 • Assess and understand some of the key ethical and research issues involved in working with social media
 data
 How will I learn?
 This is a project-style course that will meet for 90 minutes on Wednesdays and Fridays. Activities on Wednesdays
 will focus on learning for your project and will include building a shared understanding of assigned readingsthrough
 small group discussions and occasional short video/audio lecture presentations. Activities on Fridays will focus on
 learning from your project and will prioritize working and reflecting on project components in a hands-on setting.
 This mix will allow us to achieve our learning objectives as we collectively navigate a global pandemic.
 2
 Pre-requisites for the course
 There are no formal prerequisites for this course. In terms of the required skills, students need be proficient in
 programming and comfortable programming in python. You are expected to quickly learn many new things. For
 example, your project will require you to fetch Twitter data using the Twitter API or analyze posts from Reddit using
 pre-existing libraries (like python nltk, scipy), which should not be too challenging if you already know high-level
 languages like Python. Please make sure you are comfortable with this.
 How to succeed in this course
 Here are three things you can do that will help you succeed in this course:
 • Be a co-designer! This course is new and in the spirit of participatory and human-centered design, we will
 be making some decisions about the pace and exact direction of the course together. Being open to
 collaboration with me, advocating for what’s interesting to you and taking ownership of your own learning
 will be crucial.
 • Show up! This course is based on interactive flipped classroom pedagogical models, so participation in class
 is critical to individual success and to the success of the course as a whole. I have very strong expectations
 of participation. I reserve the right to reduce a student’s grade if they do not meet my expectations around
 participation.
 • Do the assigned readings and activities. Not having done so will make you a less effective participant in
 discussions. Moreover, this course will follow the design principle that your instructor should not be your
 first point of contact with new material. My responsibility will be to help you troubleshoot your
 understanding so the questions you show up with will matter.
 Course Requirements
 Required Materials
 You do not have to buy any text books for this course. All readings will be uploaded online on Canvas. In addition,
 I will provide links to additional and supporting readings as needed and appropriate.
 You do not need to buy any software. On the practical side, you would need to have python and Jupyter notebook,
 installed on your computer. At various times I will ask you to install different packages, download datasets, etc. All
 of these will be open sourced and you do not have to buy anything.
 Finally, you will need to apply for a Twitter Developer Account to access the Twitter collection APIs. I would advise
 submitting an application as soon as you realize you are interested in taking this course. Don’t wait for the first day
 of class.
 Required Devices
 You will need a laptop computer capable of going online and running a Google Colab Notebook.
 Course expectations
 As the instructor, I expect:
 • A commitment to engaged learning from every student. This includes being present and actively involved in
 our class sessions. I reserve the right to reduce student grades if this expectation is not met
 3
 • Students to act, think, and communicate with generosity and patience, and in productive and professional
 way
 • Students to take an active role in helping shape this course because it is new
 • This classroom to be a brave space for all of us to learn, explore, and discuss; while we might be dealing
 with power, difficult topics, and differing values, we remain respectful of others’ views and experiences
 Students can expect from the instructor:
 • Engaged, active instruction on course content
 • Quick responses to questions via email: within 24 hours during the week, and 48 hours on weekends
 • Timely feedback on all assignments, which is usually 2 weeks from the due date
 • A significant amount of autonomy regarding the material we cover and the topics we discuss.

 Course Activities
 A. Reading Engagements (20% of grade)
 During each class meeting (weeks 1-14), we will discuss the readings and activities that were assigned for that
 week. Prior to each class, you will have to:
 1. Think about what came up for you in terms of what you found interesting, hard, provocative, stressful
 etc. Anything that you think would generate conversation in the group is fair game.
 2. Go to a shared document for the session (a google slide-deck). Claim one page and use it as a canvas –
 populate it with words or images that will help the group think about the reading from your
 perspective. This could be your perspective on what is important in the reading, how you engaged with
 the reading, something concrete that you think we should investigate or some thoughts you’d like to
 share about yourself that are brought to your mind based on the read. We will leverage these pages in
 our class discussions.
 4
 3. Please note that an important part of your reading engagement is being “present” to discuss your
 response.
 You will also be maintaining a project ‘logbook’ that is shared with me. You will periodically be asked to make short
 personal entries about what going’s well and what you need help with.
 B. Project (50% of grade)
 Students will work individually or collectively (depending on enrollment) on a class project that will invite you to
 identify an interesting question that you can address by analyzing social media data using exploratory mixedmethods. There will be several milestones for this project that you will be required to meet, and you will present
 your work several times to get feedback on your progress. The project is worth 50% of your grade, divided across
 the milestones. You will generally be following the data science process as you go through these phases.
 • Milestone 1: submission 10% - concentrates on ideation and developing a proposal for what data to collect
 and the initial questions to ask from it
 • Milestone 2 submission 10% - focuses on data collection and some basic preliminary analysis
 • Milestone 3 submission 10% - focuses on processing, visualizing, and analyzing data using GEPHI
 • Milestone 4 submission 10% - focuses on interpretive analysis. Builds on network visualizations to drill into
 interesting features of the data using qualitative techniques
 • Milestone 5 finale submission 10% - builds on earlier phases and focuses on the final steps of analyzing,
 interpreting, reporting findings, and wrapping up your project
 Here’s an overview of the project requirements:
 • Problem:
 o Creative, interesting questions, on a domain topic of interest to the student. Your initial set of ideas
 submitted during the project idea generation submission is a starting point.
 • Data:
 o Should involve data scraped or gathered from the web.
 o Should be a sufficiently large amount of data to answer interesting non-trivial questions.
 o Should involve bringing together multiple kinds of data, to enable analysis of interesting novel
 relationships.
 o NOTE: You need to start on the data collection step early and make sure to not spend more than 2
 weeks on data collection.
 • Process:
 o Should involve exploratory, mixed-methods analysis, and should demonstrate creativity, depth, and
 thoroughness in your analysis.
 o NOTE: You should not be only presenting summary statistics of whatever data that you have
 collected. Non-trivial analysis is necessary to score points for the data analytics and processing part.
 o Should make use of a variety of visual and analytical methods (it is not required that you use all the
 methods covered in class).
 • Report:
 o Should present insightful answers to interesting non-trivial questions.
 o Should justify your findings with evidence.
 o Should present findings clearly and convincingly. Should make use of visuals.
 C. Reflections (10% of grade)
 5
 We will be engaging in 3 reflection activities over the semester. You will write short reflections about your learning
 experiences (e.g. what’s been surprising, muddy, frustrating etc). The aim is essentially to reflect on one or more of
 the following topics:
 • Your response to one or more of the readings
 • Your response to classroom discussion
 • Your reflection on some aspect(s) of the week's topics not covered by the above
 These reflections are intended to help you step outside your experiences, make sense of them and inform future
 learning.
 D. Assignments (20% of grade)
 You will have 3-4 individual homework assignments. The goal of these assignments is to help you practice some of
 the skills you will apply in your projects. Collaboration on these assignments can be useful, and I encourage it, but
 each student must turn in an individual write-up in their own words as well as code/work that is their
 own. Regardless of whether you work with others, what you turn in must be your own work; this includes code
 and interpretation of results.
 E. Dialog with the instructor (ungraded)
 I will meet with each member of the class individually at least three times during the semester. The first meeting
 (30 minutes long) will take place during the first two weeks of the course. This meeting is meant to allow us to get
 to know one another--more than the ""normal"" classroom setting usually permits. I am eager to hear what you're
 hoping to accomplish in the iSchool, what you're hoping to do afterwards, and also to answer any questions you
 might have--about the course, about me, or about anything else.
 The second meeting will take place during the middle of the semester. This is meant to allow us to discuss your
 project and participation. The third meeting will take place towards the end of the semester to discuss what you
 learned in the course, and your suggestions for improving the course in the future. I will also ask you for input on
 your final grade.
 Course Outline
 All instructions, assignments, readings, rubrics and essential information will be on the Canvas website. Check the
 site regularly and use it to ask questions about the course schedule.
 Changes to the schedule may be made at my discretion and if circumstances require. For example, we might want
 to slow down, speed up or drop certain topics depending on student input. It is your responsibility to note these
 changes when announced (although I will do my best to ensure that you receive the changes with as much
 advanced notice as possible).

 Policies
 Classroom Policies
 Statement on Learning Success
 Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need to be adaptable because we all learn differently. If there
 are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible.
 Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you
 to reach out to the student resources available through UT. Many are listed on this syllabus, but I am happy to connect
 you with a person or Center if you would like.
 Statement on Flexibility
 In acknowledgement of COVID 19 and its impact on the University of Texas at Austin community, this course will reaffirm
 one of the core values here at UT Austin: responsibility. Our responsibility to ourselves and each other is to put our
 humanity in the forefront of our academic pursuits. With that being said, this semester I commit to being adaptable in
 this time of great need, which is reflected in the course policies below around attendance, grading, and
 assignments/exams.
 If you experience any hardships such as illness, accident, family crisis please know that these policies may be amended
 and therefore you should communicate with me as soon as you feel comfortable doing so. If for any reason you do not
 feel comfortable discussing with me, please visit Student Emergency Services.
 For additional campus resources, please visit https://coronavirus.utexas.edu/students.
 Grading Policies
 Grades in graduate school are necessarily crude. The most important outcomes should be what you learn, how it impacts
 what you want to study or do in the future, and your ability to think clearly and express your ideas and research activities
 logically. This course uses the iSchool Standard Grading Scheme, which converts percentage grades into 4.0 grades (see
 below). You will receive a decimal grade for this class. General grading information for undergraduate students is available
 in the University’s General Information Catalog.
 Grade Cutoff Points needed
 A 94% 940
 A- 90% 900
 B+ 87% 870
 B 84% 840
 B- 80% 800
 C+ 77% 770
 C 74% 740
 C- 70% 700
 D 65% 650
 F <65% <650
 Your written work will be graded based on its clarity, organization, balance, amount of pertinent detail included, depth
 and clarity of evaluative and analytical comments, and preparation. It will also be graded on the extent to which a good
 understanding of the material presented in the course is shown and on the extent to which directions are followed. If 
 10
 evaluative or analytical comments are required, they should be supported by factual evidence, either from readings or
 other documents. Other aspects of individual assignments may also be included in the grading.
 Written work that shows a lack of understanding of subject matter, is unclear or poorly organized, contains few or
 irrelevant details, does not follow directions, contains little or unsubstantiated evaluative commentary, or is poorly
 written, prepared (e.g. typos, grammatical errors), or documented will receive low grades.
 Students are encouraged to take drafts of their writing assignments to the University Writing Center for assistance.
 Information on scheduling an appointment can be found here (Links to an external site.).
 Evaluation of Student Work: You may expect to receive comments on and evaluations of assignments and submitted work
 in a timely fashion. All work from the course will be returned, with comments, within two weeks of the last class of the
 semester.
 Late Assignments: Late assignments will receive reduced credit, unless the student has made prior arrangements with the
 instructor.

 The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security,
 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
 Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire
 alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
 • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest
 exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
 • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
 • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless
 given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or
 Fire Prevention Services office.

 Title IX Reporting
 Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault,
 unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded
 educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
 discrimination in all its forms. When unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature occurs in our
 community, the university can:
 1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
 2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved
 in a Title IX investigation.
 3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
 Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, report any
 information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed
 to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not
 limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. I am a Responsible
 Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before
 talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a
 responsible employee. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making an
 official report to the university, please email For more information about reporting options
 and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at or call
 512-471-0419. 
 13
 Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory
 reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer to as unprofessional or
 inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, including the types of conduct covered under Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX
 office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to support survivors.

 University Policies
 Academic Integrity
 Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The
 University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic
 integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your
 own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of
 plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
 understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following
 web address: https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php
 Q Drop Policy (modified for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters)
 If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline,
 which typically occurs near the middle of the semester, but has been extended for the spring 2021 semester to May
 11. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution—
 however, for the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, all Q-drops will be considered “non-academic,” which allows
 students to drop a class without counting toward the six-class limit. For more information about Q drops in general,
 see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop. For information about fall 2020 and spring 2021
 updates to the Q Drop Policy, see: https://t.e2ma.net/message/r3htee/j51jb0.
 Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit Grading Policy
 For the spring 2021 semester, undergraduate students may choose to have a total of three (3) classes graded on a
 Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit basis without penalty. These exceptions are new and apply only to the fall 2020 and
 spring 2021 semesters. For more information please visit UT's policy on the Extended deadline for Q-drops and P/F
 Flexibility.

UChicago,PPHA 30535: Data and Programming for Public Policy I,https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/2020-04/ppha30535_dataandprogrammingi_levy_spring2020updated.pdf,Found," PPHA 30535: Data and Programming for Public Policy I Jeff Levy levyjeff@uchicago.edu Keller 3101 Spring Quarter, 2020 April 6th - June 13th Updated for University COVID-19 Closures Course Information Labs Part 1: M 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM T 9:30 AM - 10:50 AM T 11:00 AM - 12:20 PM T 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM Labs Part 2: W 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM Th 9:30 AM - 10:50 AM Th 11:00 AM - 12:20 PM Th 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM Teaching Assistants Sarah Gill - gills@uchicago.edu Josh Laven - jlaven@uchicago.edu Sawyer Middeleer - sawyerm@uchicago.edu Simon Park - simonpark@uchicago.edu Changes for Online Teaching The class will have three components each week : • Watching two15-25 minute long pre-recorded lectures • Attending two live lab sessions on Zoom • Completing one homework assignment There will be no fully-synchronous lecture time. The four lecture periods originally scheduled have been converted into additional lab slots, making eight total. Four will be run by me, and one each by the TAs. You must attend one lab on Monday or Tuesday, and one lab on Wednesday or Thursday. In a remote learning setting, it is crucial that students remain involved in the course as much as possible, since it can become easy to feel disconnected from the class and the material without being physically present. In order to emphasize this, lab attendance is now worth 20% of your final grade. See the grading section for more details. 1 Lectures introducing the material for the week will be posted on Canvas by Monday morning and by Wednesday morning. You can watch this material any time you choose, but should complete it before attending a lab. The class will also have a Piazza message board, participation on which will earn up to 5% extra credit. Course Objectives This programming and data course is geared toward public policy students who have either no past programming experience, or minimal experience primarily in proprietary platforms like Stata and SAS. The goal is to prepare students both for future Harris courses and for entry-level positions working in policy research, such as (but not limited to) research assistants at policy institutions or as interns at think tanks. The content is drawn heavily from the professor’s years of experience working at the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, DC. Over the quarter, students will learn: • The basics of public policy programming: the languages used, how to set up needed software, coding best practices, and how to work collaboratively. • The Python programming language: – Beginning Python, including logic control, loops, functions, classes, methods, and input-output – Data exploration and visualization – Data APIs and web scraping – Data analysis This course will take a narrow view of computer programming, focusing on learning skills necessary to work as a policy researcher, while passing over some more advanced skills that are common in computer science. This includes, for example, an understanding of multiprocessing, unit testing, or the creation graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, the skills learned in this class will provide a foundation for the student to pursue these topics in the future. Language Selection Both of my sections (3 and 4) will use the Python programming language. According to the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer’s Survey, Python is the 4th most popular programming language in the world, and the most popular choice of data professionals. It was also voted the 2nd ”most loved” programming language in the world. Python is easy and enjoyable to work with, while offering the power and flexibility of a general-purpose programming language. I am confident that a student completing this course will learn both a highly useful, modern language that will apply to their future work with policy data, as well as the underlying programming principles that can be applied to any other language the student encounters. This course is also offered in the R language, which together with Python makes up the two most important languages of research programming and data science. Both languages have their respective strengths, and I would recommend either to an aspiring researcher. If you prefer to work in R, or if those classes fit your schedule better, you should enroll in sections 1 or 2, taught by Peter Ganong. All four sections, regardless of language, are carefully synchronized by expected work load, grading, and broad topics covered. 2 Data and Programming Skills II (PPHA 30536) will also be offered in both Python and R this fall, so if you continue with the sequence, you should plan to take the same language for both classes. You can read my syllabus for that course in Python here. Software and Resources There are no required text books for this class. Python is extremely well sup- ported online. I expect students will primarily be using the official Python documentation and StackOverflow, which will be discussed in class. For the data sections, however, I suggest purchasing the text Python for Data Analysis 2nd Edition by Wes Mckinney, which is available online or in the school bookstore. Not only is it very useful both as a quick reference and when read comphrehensively as a guide, it is also written by the author of Pandas, the package used for data analysis in Python. The package is free and open-source, so this is also a good way of giving back to the creator. If you purchase this it is very important you get the 2nd edition, as the original is outdated. There are two pieces of software that are required for this class, and two that I suggest, all of which are free. Required: • Please have ready on day one with the Anaconda Python Distribution installed already. Please select version 3.7, though 3.6 will also work if you installed it previously. No version of Python 2.x is acceptable. • Please have ready on day one with the GitHub Desktop installed. You may also use the Git command line interface if you have it installed from before and know how to use it, though it also comes as part of the Desktop download. Suggested: • The Atom open-source text editor. I suggest Atom, but perfectly viable alternatives include Sublime, Vim, and many others. You may also chose to use one of the IDEs (integrated development environments) that comes with Anaconda, such as Spyder. • The Notepad++ text editor. This is strictly optional, but I find this lightweight text editor useful for viewing raw data alongside my code when necessary. You can choose it as your text editor for coding, as well. Note that overall, the software environment you choose for developing code is entirely personal preference. You simply must have some distribution of the programming language you will work in, some place to write your code, and some place to run your code. We will discuss all this software the first week of class. Attendance If you experience issues with attending labs or completing work due to child care or illness, please speak with me directly so we can find an accommodation. Attendance to at least two labs per week (one on Monday or Wednesday and one on Tuesday or Thursday) is mandatory, and graded. While you are enrolled in a lab time slot based on your class section, all M-T labs are interchangeable, and all W-Th labs are interchangeable. Lab times are listed at the top of this syllabus. 3 Academic Integrity All code you turn in must be your own. Do not share your code with your classmates, or ask others for theirs. That said, the practice of writing code is very often a collaborative one. To avoid academic dishonesty, and a potential failing grade, please follow these guidelines: 1. You MAY search for help online (e.g. StackOverflow) • You must always cite the source by leaving a link to it in the com- ments of your code • You MAY NOT copy verbatim - find inspiration and then rewrite it • You MAY NOT take solutions to problem sets from online 2. You MAY work with your classmates • You must always cite the individuals you collaborate directly with by including their names in the comments at the top of your program • You MAY NOT share or look at each other’s code • You MAY share output (e.g. plots or error messages) • You MAY discuss concepts and theory (e.g. using a whiteboard) 3. You MAY participate in discussions on Piazza • You MAY share generic or pseudo code, and ideas • You MAY NOT share specific code from your own work 4. When explicitly allowed, you MAY work in groups • If groups are optional, you must declare your group the day the assignment is given • You will collaborate, share code, and submit only one assignment It is very important that you use proper citations. If you turn in an assign- ment that the grader deems to be too unoriginal (e.g. your solutions too closely follow a solution found online, or another classmates), but you have citied all the sources, then you may be allowed a chance to redo your work. If the same thing happens but you have not cited the sources, you will receive a failing grade and possibly be subject to other sanctions under the university’s Academic Integrity guide. The above rules apply to interactions with your classmates and the internet. You may present your code and questions to the professor or the TAs at any time. Homework, Exams, and Grading There are no exams or projects in this class. Assignments will be due on GitHub Classroom, which will be discussed in class. Late work is not accepted without prior approval or with a documented emergency. Your grade will be calculated as 80% weekly assignments, 20% weekly lab attendance. There are eight problem sets, with your lowest score being dropped automatically. You must achieve a 60% or greater in the class in order to pass. All grades that meet this level will use the following curve: 1/3 A, 1/4 A-, 1/4 B+, 1/12 B, 1/12 B-. Additionally, you can earn up to 5% extra credit for helpful questions and answers on our Piazza discussion board. 4 Course Outline This outline may be subject to change. Week 1: Introduction 1.

Statsmodels, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, part 2 5 ",," PPHA 30535: Data and Programming for Public Policy I 3101 Spring Quarter, 2020 April 6th - June 13th Updated for University COVID-19 Closures Course Information Labs Part 1: M 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM T 9:30 AM - 10:50 AM T 11:00 AM - 12:20 PM T 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM Labs Part 2: W 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM Th 9:30 AM - 10:50 AM Th 11:00 AM - 12:20 PM Th 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM Teaching Assistants Changes for Online Teaching The class will have three components each week : • Watching two15-25 minute long pre-recorded lectures • Attending two live lab sessions on Zoom • Completing one homework assignment There will be no fully-synchronous lecture time. The four lecture periods originally scheduled have been converted into additional lab slots, making eight total. Four will be run by me, and one each by the TAs. You must attend one lab on Monday or Tuesday, and one lab on Wednesday or Thursday. In a remote learning setting, it is crucial that students remain involved in the course as much as possible, since it can become easy to feel disconnected from the class and the material without being physically present. In order to emphasize this, lab attendance is now worth 20% of your final grade. See the grading section for more details. 1 Lectures introducing the material for the week will be posted on Canvas by Monday morning and by Wednesday morning. You can watch this material any time you choose, but should complete it before attending a lab. The class will also have a Piazza message board, participation on which will earn up to 5% extra credit. Course Objectives This programming and data course is geared toward public policy students who have either no past programming experience, or minimal experience primarily in proprietary platforms like Stata and SAS. The goal is to prepare students both for future Harris courses and for entry-level positions working in policy research, such as (but not limited to) research assistants at policy institutions or as interns at think tanks. The content is drawn heavily from the professor’s years of experience working at the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, DC. Over the quarter, students will learn: • The basics of public policy programming: the languages used, how to set up needed software, coding best practices, and how to work collaboratively. • The Python programming language: – Beginning Python, including logic control, loops, functions, classes, methods, and input-output – Data exploration and visualization – Data APIs and web scraping – Data analysis This course will take a narrow view of computer programming, focusing on learning skills necessary to work as a policy researcher, while passing over some more advanced skills that are common in computer science. This includes, for example, an understanding of multiprocessing, unit testing, or the creation graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, the skills learned in this class will provide a foundation for the student to pursue these topics in the future. Language Selection Both of my sections (3 and 4) will use the Python programming language. According to the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer’s Survey, Python is the 4th most popular programming language in the world, and the most popular choice of data professionals. It was also voted the 2nd ”most loved” programming language in the world. Python is easy and enjoyable to work with, while offering the power and flexibility of a general-purpose programming language. I am confident that a student completing this course will learn both a highly useful, modern language that will apply to their future work with policy data, as well as the underlying programming principles that can be applied to any other language the student encounters. This course is also offered in the R language, which together with Python makes up the two most important languages of research programming and data science. Both languages have their respective strengths, and I would recommend either to an aspiring researcher. If you prefer to work in R, or if those classes fit your schedule better, you should enroll in sections 1 or 2, taught by Peter Ganong. All four sections, regardless of language, are carefully synchronized by expected work load, grading, and broad topics covered. 2 Data and Programming Skills II (PPHA 30536) will also be offered in both Python and R this fall, so if you continue with the sequence, you should plan to take the same language for both classes. You can read my syllabus for that course in Python here. Software and Resources There are no required text books for this class. Python is extremely well sup- ported online. I expect students will primarily be using the official Python documentation and StackOverflow, which will be discussed in class. For the data sections, however, I suggest purchasing the text Python for Data Analysis 2nd Edition by Wes Mckinney, which is available online or in the school bookstore. Not only is it very useful both as a quick reference and when read comphrehensively as a guide, it is also written by the author of Pandas, the package used for data analysis in Python. The package is free and open-source, so this is also a good way of giving back to the creator. If you purchase this it is very important you get the 2nd edition, as the original is outdated. There are two pieces of software that are required for this class, and two that I suggest, all of which are free. Required: • Please have ready on day one with the Anaconda Python Distribution installed already. Please select version 3.7, though 3.6 will also work if you installed it previously. No version of Python 2.x is acceptable. • Please have ready on day one with the GitHub Desktop installed. You may also use the Git command line interface if you have it installed from before and know how to use it, though it also comes as part of the Desktop download. Suggested: • The Atom open-source text editor. I suggest Atom, but perfectly viable alternatives include Sublime, Vim, and many others. You may also chose to use one of the IDEs (integrated development environments) that comes with Anaconda, such as Spyder. • The Notepad++ text editor. This is strictly optional, but I find this lightweight text editor useful for viewing raw data alongside my code when necessary. You can choose it as your text editor for coding, as well. Note that overall, the software environment you choose for developing code is entirely personal preference. You simply must have some distribution of the programming language you will work in, some place to write your code, and some place to run your code. We will discuss all this software the first week of class.

UChicago,PPHA 35560 - Translating Evidence for Public Policy and Program Design,https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/2020-08/ppha35560_translatingevidence_wolfe_autumn2020.pdf,Found," PPHA 35560 - Translating Evidence for Public Policy and Program Design (Draft Syllabus) Prof: Rebecca Wolfe M, W: 3:30-4:50 PM CT Zoom Office Hours: Tuesdays, 8 AM -10 AM Overview: The demand for the use of evidence in designing international development programs and policy continues to grow. However, policy makers’ often have questions about how to interpret and use the evidence generated. How generalizable are these results? How to interpret null results? Mixed outcomes? Short- and long-term effects? Are these results scalable? Additionally, what are the political barriers to using evidence? In this course, we will explore how to think about these issues and others in relation to designing policies and programs in the international development sphere. We will examine these questions through various development sectors: economic development, governance, food security, refugees, education and peacebuilding. In this course we will cover various topics related to evidence-based policy making, including: • Elements of Policy and Program Design o Theories of Change • Generalizability and Context Specificity • External Validity • How and when do you scale a program? • Ethical Considerations • Political Barriers Each week, we will dive into at least one evaluation of a program or policy. We will ask ourselves if and how policy makers could and/or should use this evidence. I will bring in guest speakers occasionally, either those who worked on the evaluation or practitioners who are figuring out how to use the evidence. Course Structure (tentative based on numbers): This is a discussion-based course. There are no clear-cut answers to many of these questions. My aim is to have you become more comfortable with the questions and think through how to wrestle with the dilemmas they pose and think critically about a) how to generate relevant evidence and b) when and how to use it. I will normally start classes with about 30-40 minutes of lecture, and then open to discussion. We also likely will have more discussion in Wednesdays class than Mondays (see Weekly Readings and Class Participation below). Assignments: Note: All written assignments are expected to be single-spaced, 12-point font, with one-inch margins. Those submitted that don’t follow these instructions will not be graded. All submissions through Canvas. The crux of your grade will be a three-part assignment which has two building blocks before the final assignment, which is writing a program or policy for a donor within some technical sector (economic development, education, governance, etc.) in a country in the Global South. At the beginning of the term, you will select a type of intervention (e.g., food aid, cash, elections, vocational training, teacher training, etc.) and a context. Topics and Contexts are due to me by October 12th via Canvas. 1. Collecting the Evidence (20%): Due October 21 at midnight. The first building block is collecting the evidence for your intervention. Has it been conducted in your chosen context? In a similar context (e.g., similar level of fragility/poverty, similar political and economic systems)? What are the outcomes? Can you tell how it was implemented? Systematic reviews and Evidence Gap Maps can provide a good starting place for this paper. Note: not all evidence needs to be from RCTs. Quasi-experimental evaluations and strong qualitative evaluations are acceptable. If there is no relevant causal evidence, please make note, and review what does exist. Provide no more than a 4-page summary of the evidence. Feel free to use tables to summarize the evidence. See Canvas for an example. Tables are included in the page limit. 2. Evaluating the Use (25%): November 18 at midnight. For the second paper, you will find a request for proposal (oddly, called an RFA) or a Policy (e.g., Food for Peace, DFID stabilization framework) and grade the RFA/policy on how well the donor has incorporated the evidence. The RFA/policy will be in the technical area you have chosen, and ideally in your context. For a policy, it may be a bit broader than your specific area, so you can limit it yourself to grading how it uses the specific area you are interested. If you are not able to find a relevant RFA in your chosen context, we will identify a reasonable alternative. If you have chosen a policy, you will note how well the policy addresses the context you have chosen (e.g., education policy where much of the population is displaced). You will give the RFA a grade (A to F) and justify the grade based on the evidence you collected in your earlier paper. Did the donor reference relevant evidence? Did it acknowledge mixed outcomes or where the intervention worked and didn’t? Will the implementation of the program/policy lead to generation of more evidence (i.e., what is the Monitoring and Evaluation plan)? Page limit: 2 pages 3. Using the Evidence (30%): Due December 11 at midnight. For the final paper, you will design a program based on the RFA or policy you identified for the previous assignment. See sample on Canvas. The paper will include the following sections: • Context and Problem Statement: (2 pages). This is a description of the context, and what is the problem the program will address.

1. General Information
This course introduces students with methods and practices involved in the planning, design and security
of information infrastructure commonly found in large and medium enterprises. The course is divided into
two 8-week modules, one emphasizing networking and the other security, taught separately.
1.1 Learning Objectives
Students will learn the fundamental concepts underlying enterprise networks regarding architecture,
operation, and security. Additionally, students will develop networked Java applications to gain familiarity
with networking concepts. As IDS 401 is a prerequisite for this course, students are expected to have
some proficiency in coding Java applications. Further details about the topics to be covered are provided
in the course schedule on the last page of this document.
1.2 Course Components
Lectures will follow the course outline, although minor adjustments may occur during the semester.
Students are expected to read the relevant PowerPoint slides and any assigned readings before lectures.
1.3 Course Materials (Security Module)

1.4 Blackboard Sites
We will be using the Blackboard facility for this course. By enrolling in IDS 520, you will also be enrolled
on the corresponding Blackboard site. This site will provide course announcements and PowerPoint
slides for lectures, and upload features for homework assignments. To access the site, point your browser
to http://blackboard.uic.edu. Your Blackboard login name is your UIC NetID (lower case!). This is the part
before the @ in your UIC e-mail address; your password is your usual UIC password (the one you use to
access UIC computers).
All major announcements about the course will be posted on Blackboard and important notices
will generally be forwarded to your e-mail address. However, you are ultimately responsible for
checking Blackboard to keep informed regarding any course updates.
1.5 E-Mail Communication
We will generally respond to your e-mails within 48 hours and often much sooner. However, we do get a
lot of e-mail and sometimes overlook a message. If you do not receive a response within 72 hours, please
resend it. However, please do not e-mail questions about an assignment two hours before the deadline
and expect an immediate response!
When e-mailing either instructor, please include IDS 520 in your subject line. This will help process your
request faster. Also, when using Blackboard’s e-mail tools, please send e-mail only to the intended
recipient, not one of the group options, which may cause your e-mails to be marked as spam.
1.6 Attendance Policy
Except for exam days, attendance is not graded. However, although attendance for non-exam sessions is
not graded, please arrive on time and, if you must leave during lecture, do so quietly. In lecture, major
concepts and definitions will be presented and discussed. Your best information about exam content will
come from lectures and homework assignments. If you miss class, you can find out what was covered
from an updated course syllabus (available on Blackboard) or from consulting with fellow students.
Students are expected to be present for exams at the regularly scheduled times. Do not expect special
accommodations for your convenience. If you miss a midterm without a valid excuse, you will
automatically incur a 10% penalty. If you miss a final exam without a valid excuse, you will receive an
incomplete for the course; to pass the course, you will need to take the final exam in a future semester.
Any make-up exams will be given after the scheduled time. Exams are not given early; this also
applies to exams taken at the DRC (see 1.8). You may only be excused from the regularly scheduled
times for the midterms and final under the two following circumstances:
1. If you provide a note from a doctor concerning your unavoidable absence.
2. If you provide the instructor with a valid reason for your absence in advance.
Valid Excuse: Although it is not possible to list every possible valid excuse for missing class, good
examples are medical emergencies (either your own or a dependent’s), participation in UIC athletic
events, military obligations, and court dates. As a general rule, if you have scheduled the reason
yourself, it is not a valid excuse for absence!
If you miss an exam with valid cause, you should notify your instructor as soon as possible to schedule
your make-up exam. Likewise, if you miss a lab session, please inform me if you intend to make it up.
Should you be absent for an extended period of time, please notify your professors and college advising
office.

1.7 In-Class Behavior
During class, please help create a good learning environment by remaining reasonably quiet and keeping
your cell phone silent. As our class has over three hundred students, students talking can make it very
difficult for anyone to hear. If you must communicate with your fellow students, please use silent options
like texting or writing notes or, better yet, wait until after class. Students who cannot comply with these
basic tenets of courtesy will be publicly shamed by one or more of the following:
 Being requested to stand up and introduce themselves to the class
 Being asked what is so urgent that it cannot wait until the end of lecture
 Being asked to leave for the remainder of the lecture or lab
1.8 Students with Disabilities
The University of Illinois at Chicago is committed to maintaining a barrier-free environment so that
individuals with disabilities can fully access programs, courses, services, and activities at UIC. Students
with disabilities who require accommodations for full access and participation in UIC Programs must be
registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or
(312) 413- 0123 (TDD). For all students with documented disabilities, it is very important that you
inform your instructors about your accommodations so we can plan for your exams.
2. Grading
Grades will be based on the structure in the table below.
No additional extra credit opportunities will be offered.
Networking:
Homework (2 assignments @ 50pts) 100

3. Course Administration
This course and its coursework are being administered under the policies of the University of Illinois at
Chicago (UIC) College of Business Administration Honor Code. All students are expected to respect and
uphold this code. Violations of the Honor Code are just causes for discipline under the University of Illinois
at Chicago Student Disciplinary Procedure, and all allegations of Honor Code violations shall be handled
pursuant to that Procedure.
3.1 Honor Code for the College of Business Administration
As an academic community the College of Business Administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago
is committed to providing an environment in which teaching, learning, research, and scholarship can
flourish and in which all endeavors are guided by academic and professional integrity. All members of the
college community – students, faculty, staff, and administrators – share the responsibility of insuring that
high standards of integrity are upheld so that such an environment exists.
In pursuit of these high ideas and standards of academic life, as a student I hereby commit myself to
respect and uphold the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Business Administration Honor
Code during my entire matriculation at UIC. I agree to maintain the highest moral and ethical standards in
all academic and business endeavors and to conduct myself honorably as a responsible member of the
college academic community. This includes the following:
 Not to seek unfair advantage over other students, including, but not limited to giving or receiving
unauthorized aid during completion of academic requirements;
 To represent fact and self truthfully at all times;
 To respect the property and personal rights of all members of the academic community.
3.2 Plagiarism and Inappropriate Use of Others' Work
The University standards on originality of submitted work apply in this course: don’t copy from other
students or turn in other students’ work as your own. If there is clear evidence of copying another
student’s work on a quiz, test, exam or homework, the involved students will receive zeroes for that grade
and formal disciplinary action may be undertaken.
Homework assignments: Talking to other students about homework assignments is a good way to
enrich your understanding of the material. However, each student must write up the assignment on his or
her own. To avoid misuse of your work, you should not share your papers or files with others.

 1. General Information
 This course introduces students with methods and practices involved in the planning, design and security
 of information infrastructure commonly found in large and medium enterprises. The course is divided into
 two 8-week modules, one emphasizing networking and the other security, taught separately.
 1.1 Learning Objectives
 Students will learn the fundamental concepts underlying enterprise networks regarding architecture,
 operation, and security. Additionally, students will develop networked Java applications to gain familiarity
 with networking concepts. As IDS 401 is a prerequisite for this course, students are expected to have
 some proficiency in coding Java applications. Further details about the topics to be covered are provided
 in the course schedule on the last page of this document.
 1.2 Course Components
 Lectures will follow the course outline, although minor adjustments may occur during the semester.
 Students are expected to read the relevant PowerPoint slides and any assigned readings before lectures.

 1.4 Blackboard Sites
 We will be using the Blackboard facility for this course. By enrolling in IDS 520, you will also be enrolled
 on the corresponding Blackboard site. This site will provide course announcements and PowerPoint
 slides for lectures, and upload features for homework assignments. To access the site, point your browser
 to http://blackboard.uic.edu. Your Blackboard login name is your UIC NetID (lower case!). This is the part
 before the in your UIC e-mail address; your password is your usual UIC password (the one you use to
 access UIC computers).
 All major announcements about the course will be posted on Blackboard and important notices
 will generally be forwarded to your e-mail address. However, you are ultimately responsible for
 checking Blackboard to keep informed regarding any course updates.
 1.5 E-Mail Communication
 We will generally respond to your e-mails within 48 hours and often much sooner. However, we do get a
 lot of e-mail and sometimes overlook a message. If you do not receive a response within 72 hours, please
 resend it. However, please do not e-mail questions about an assignment two hours before the deadline
 and expect an immediate response!
 When e-mailing either instructor, please include IDS 520 in your subject line. This will help process your
 request faster. Also, when using Blackboard’s e-mail tools, please send e-mail only to the intended
 recipient, not one of the group options, which may cause your e-mails to be marked as spam.
 1.6 Attendance Policy
 Except for exam days, attendance is not graded. However, although attendance for non-exam sessions is
 not graded, please arrive on time and, if you must leave during lecture, do so quietly. In lecture, major
 concepts and definitions will be presented and discussed. Your best information about exam content will
 come from lectures and homework assignments. If you miss class, you can find out what was covered
 from an updated course syllabus (available on Blackboard) or from consulting with fellow students.
 Students are expected to be present for exams at the regularly scheduled times. Do not expect special
 accommodations for your convenience. If you miss a midterm without a valid excuse, you will
 automatically incur a 10% penalty. If you miss a final exam without a valid excuse, you will receive an
 incomplete for the course; to pass the course, you will need to take the final exam in a future semester.
 Any make-up exams will be given after the scheduled time. Exams are not given early; this also
 applies to exams taken at the DRC (see 1.8). You may only be excused from the regularly scheduled
 times for the midterms and final under the two following circumstances:
 1. If you provide a note from a doctor concerning your unavoidable absence.
 2. If you provide the instructor with a valid reason for your absence in advance.
 Valid Excuse: Although it is not possible to list every possible valid excuse for missing class, good
 examples are medical emergencies (either your own or a dependent’s), participation in UIC athletic
 events, military obligations, and court dates. As a general rule, if you have scheduled the reason
 yourself, it is not a valid excuse for absence!
 If you miss an exam with valid cause, you should notify your instructor as soon as possible to schedule
 your make-up exam. Likewise, if you miss a lab session, please inform me if you intend to make it up.
 Should you be absent for an extended period of time, please notify your professors and college advising
 office.

 https://www.coursehero.com/file/25141554/IDS-520-Syllabus-Fall-2017doc/
 1.7 In-Class Behavior
 During class, please help create a good learning environment by remaining reasonably quiet and keeping
 your cell phone silent. As our class has over three hundred students, students talking can make it very
 difficult for anyone to hear. If you must communicate with your fellow students, please use silent options
 like texting or writing notes or, better yet, wait until after class. Students who cannot comply with these
 basic tenets of courtesy will be publicly shamed by one or more of the following:
 · Being requested to stand up and introduce themselves to the class
 · Being asked what is so urgent that it cannot wait until the end of lecture
 · Being asked to leave for the remainder of the lecture or lab
 1.8 Students with Disabilities
 The University of Illinois at Chicago is committed to maintaining a barrier-free environment so that
 individuals with disabilities can fully access programs, courses, services, and activities at UIC. Students
 with disabilities who require accommodations for full access and participation in UIC Programs must be
 registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or
 (312) 413- 0123 (TDD). For all students with documented disabilities, it is very important that you
 inform your instructors about your accommodations so we can plan for your exams.
 2. Grading
 Grades will be based on the structure in the table below.
 No additional extra credit opportunities will be offered.
 Networking:
 Homework (2 assignments 50pts) 100
 Quizzes (2 50pts) 100

 1. General Information
 This course introduces students with methods and practices involved in the planning, design and security
 of information infrastructure commonly found in large and medium enterprises. The course is divided into
 two 8-week modules, one emphasizing networking and the other security, taught separately.
 1.1 Learning Objectives
 Students will learn the fundamental concepts underlying enterprise networks regarding architecture,
 operation, and security. Additionally, students will develop networked Java applications to gain familiarity
 with networking concepts. As IDS 401 is a prerequisite for this course, students are expected to have
 some proficiency in coding Java applications. Further details about the topics to be covered are provided
 in the course schedule on the last page of this document.
 1.2 Course Components
 Lectures will follow the course outline, although minor adjustments may occur during the semester.
 Students are expected to read the relevant PowerPoint slides and any assigned readings before lectures.

 1.4 Blackboard Sites
 We will be using the Blackboard facility for this course. By enrolling in IDS 520, you will also be enrolled
 on the corresponding Blackboard site. This site will provide course announcements and PowerPoint
 slides for lectures, and upload features for homework assignments. To access the site, point your browser
 to http://blackboard.uic.edu. Your Blackboard login name is your UIC NetID (lower case!). This is the part
 before the in your UIC e-mail address; your password is your usual UIC password (the one you use to
 access UIC computers).
 All major announcements about the course will be posted on Blackboard and important notices
 will generally be forwarded to your e-mail address. However, you are ultimately responsible for
 checking Blackboard to keep informed regarding any course updates.
 1.5 E-Mail Communication
 We will generally respond to your e-mails within 48 hours and often much sooner. However, we do get a
 lot of e-mail and sometimes overlook a message. If you do not receive a response within 72 hours, please
 resend it. However, please do not e-mail questions about an assignment two hours before the deadline
 and expect an immediate response!
 When e-mailing either instructor, please include IDS 520 in your subject line. This will help process your
 request faster. Also, when using Blackboard’s e-mail tools, please send e-mail only to the intended
 recipient, not one of the group options, which may cause your e-mails to be marked as spam.
 1.6 Attendance Policy
 Except for exam days, attendance is not graded. However, although attendance for non-exam sessions is
 not graded, please arrive on time and, if you must leave during lecture, do so quietly. In lecture, major
 concepts and definitions will be presented and discussed. Your best information about exam content will
 come from lectures and homework assignments. If you miss class, you can find out what was covered
 from an updated course syllabus (available on Blackboard) or from consulting with fellow students.
 Students are expected to be present for exams at the regularly scheduled times. Do not expect special
 accommodations for your convenience. If you miss a midterm without a valid excuse, you will
 automatically incur a 10% penalty. If you miss a final exam without a valid excuse, you will receive an
 incomplete for the course; to pass the course, you will need to take the final exam in a future semester.
 Any make-up exams will be given after the scheduled time. Exams are not given early; this also
 applies to exams taken at the DRC (see 1.8). You may only be excused from the regularly scheduled
 times for the midterms and final under the two following circumstances:
 1. If you provide a note from a doctor concerning your unavoidable absence.
 2. If you provide the instructor with a valid reason for your absence in advance.
 Valid Excuse: Although it is not possible to list every possible valid excuse for missing class, good
 examples are medical emergencies (either your own or a dependent’s), participation in UIC athletic
 events, military obligations, and court dates. As a general rule, if you have scheduled the reason
 yourself, it is not a valid excuse for absence!
 If you miss an exam with valid cause, you should notify your instructor as soon as possible to schedule
 your make-up exam. Likewise, if you miss a lab session, please inform me if you intend to make it up.
 Should you be absent for an extended period of time, please notify your professors and college advising
 office.

 1.7 In-Class Behavior
 During class, please help create a good learning environment by remaining reasonably quiet and keeping
 your cell phone silent. As our class has over three hundred students, students talking can make it very
 difficult for anyone to hear. If you must communicate with your fellow students, please use silent options
 like texting or writing notes or, better yet, wait until after class. Students who cannot comply with these
 basic tenets of courtesy will be publicly shamed by one or more of the following:
 · Being requested to stand up and introduce themselves to the class
 · Being asked what is so urgent that it cannot wait until the end of lecture
 · Being asked to leave for the remainder of the lecture or lab
 1.8 Students with Disabilities
 The University of Illinois at Chicago is committed to maintaining a barrier-free environment so that
 individuals with disabilities can fully access programs, courses, services, and activities at UIC. Students
 with disabilities who require accommodations for full access and participation in UIC Programs must be
 registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or
 (312) 413- 0123 (TDD). For all students with documented disabilities, it is very important that you
 inform your instructors about your accommodations so we can plan for your exams.
 2. Grading

 receive full credit. Please do not submit your homework via e-mail or the Digital Dropbox on
 Blackboard!
 If you ask at least two days in advance, you can receive a three-day deadline extension without
 penalty. Otherwise, late submissions are accepted one week after the regular deadline but will
 have 10pts automatically deducted. You are urged to submit your homework early, as the system
 may not be up at the deadline time. It is your responsibility to make sure that the homework
 is uploaded on time.
 · Quizzes: There will be two quizzes worth 50 points each. Their timing and coverage will be
 announced through Blackboard. Quizzes serve three purposes: to inform students about their
 current understanding of the course material; to give early insight into the style of exam
 questions; and to dissuade students from waiting until the last possible moment to study the
 course material.

 3. Course Administration
 This course and its coursework are being administered under the policies of the University of Illinois at
 Chicago (UIC) College of Business Administration Honor Code. All students are expected to respect and
 uphold this code. Violations of the Honor Code are just causes for discipline under the University of Illinois
 at Chicago Student Disciplinary Procedure, and all allegations of Honor Code violations shall be handled
 pursuant to that Procedure.
 3.1 Honor Code for the College of Business Administration
 As an academic community the College of Business Administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago
 is committed to providing an environment in which teaching, learning, research, and scholarship can
 flourish and in which all endeavors are guided by academic and professional integrity. All members of the
 college community – students, faculty, staff, and administrators – share the responsibility of insuring that
 high standards of integrity are upheld so that such an environment exists.
 In pursuit of these high ideas and standards of academic life, as a student I hereby commit myself to
 respect and uphold the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Business Administration Honor
 Code during my entire matriculation at UIC. I agree to maintain the highest moral and ethical standards in
 all academic and business endeavors and to conduct myself honorably as a responsible member of the
 college academic community. This includes the following:
 · Not to seek unfair advantage over other students, including, but not limited to giving or receiving
 unauthorized aid during completion of academic requirements;
 · To represent fact and self truthfully at all times;
 · To respect the property and personal rights of all members of the academic community.
 3.2 Plagiarism and Inappropriate Use of Others' Work
 The University standards on originality of submitted work apply in this course: don’t copy from other
 students or turn in other students’ work as your own. If there is clear evidence of copying another
 student’s work on a quiz, test, exam or homework, the involved students will receive zeroes for that grade
 and formal disciplinary action may be undertaken.
 Homework assignments: Talking to other students about homework assignments is a good way to
 enrich your understanding of the material. However, each student must write up the assignment on his or
 her own. To avoid misuse of your work, you should not share your papers or files with others.
 COPYING WILL RESULT IN YOUR RECEIVING A ZERO SCORE FOR THE WHOLE ASSIGNMENT,
 EVEN IF COPYING IS LIMITED TO A SINGLE QUESTION. Each student must independently create an
 Excel file and enter the data and formulas in their own spreadsheet. You may not submit another
 student’s file, and groups of students may not submit copies of the same file. Cutting and pasting
 from another student’s file is also not allowed. If the same file is submitted by more than one student, all
 involved students will receive a grade of zero for that assignment. If it is obvious that the information was
 cut and pasted from another student’s file, all involved students will also receive a grade of zero for that
 assignment. Repeated incidents will result in failing the course.
 Exams: There is to be no copying or collusion during exams. Submitting exams for other students will be
 regarded as cheating. To inhibit cheating, multiple versions of exams will be provided.

Course Description
This course is an intensive introduction to and overview of some foundational issues in ethical issues
surrounding the collection, analysis, and use of data in a variety of contexts. We will cover
theoretical, legal, and policy-level approaches to several issues that are probably already familiar to
you. There are two primary components to your work. First is engagement with the course material.
You will be responsible for reading and critically assessing the course materials, and engaging with
the rest of the class regarding those materials, each week. Second is a substantial case study on a
data problem of your choice.
This is a 3-credit hour or a 4-credit hour course. One credit is the learning that takes place in at least
45 hours of learning activities, which include time in lectures or class meetings, in person or online,
labs, exams, presentations, tutorials, reading, writing, studying, preparation for any of these activities,
and any other learning activities.
Required Texts
Hannah Fry, Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms (2018) (ISBN: 0393357368). This is
very easy-to-read book that provides some background information for several course units. It's
inexpensive, widely available, and in multiple formats (electronic, paperback, audio).
Other readings will be made available each week in the weekly Canvas modules
Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
After completing this course, students will be able to:
Identify, analyze, and evaluate moral problems in collecting, analyzing, and using data.
Distinguish and explain different types of moral concerns in data collection, analysis, and use,
including (inter alia) harm, discrimination, procedural unfairness, respect for persons, and
democratic legitimacy.
Explain and evaluate key moral issues surrounding data collection, analysis, and use in a variety
of domains, including (inter alia): commerce, healthcare, research, law enforcement and security,
education, and social media.
Understand the various philosophical theories, issues, and ideas that we address and apply
those theories, issues, and ideas to problems in data and ethics.
Examine and critique the arguments we encounter, and to bring original and creative ideas to
bear on those arguments.
Grading
A student’s final letter grade will be based on the following:
A: 94+%
AB: 88+%
B: 82+%
BC: 77+%
C: 72+%
D: 60+%
F: below 60%
A student’s final number grade will be distributed across assignments as follows:
Assignments: Comm B sections (4 credits)
Participation (10%)
A key component of this course is your regular, active, and thoughtful participation in discussion
sections. We will not grade on mere attendance; rather, we will consider your participation in
discussion your classmates’ presentations and in peer review exercises. You will be graded on
quality of contributions during both lecture and discussion. For the asynchronous Comm B students,
this will include work with your ""writing group"" in Memo Discussions.
Memos – 10% total (2% each memo)
You will write five short memos (roughly one page, double-spaced, or 300 words) on questions I pose
about the course readings. You will use these during discussion sections to work on writing. The first
several will go through peer review and then be graded by your TA or instructor.
*You will turn memos in via Canvas AND bring a paper copy to discussion section (if in person) for
peer-review.
For more specific instructions, consult the “Memo Assignment Specifics” document (Canvas).
Stories about Algorithms, Data, Information, and Ethics (SADIEs)—
20% total (5% each paper, 5% each presentation)
Twice during the semester you will be required to find a recent news story about a data or algorithm
issue, trend, case, technology, law, practice, or related matter, and prepare a summary of the story
and its relation to course content in a paper of two-three pages, completed before the start of
discussion that week . In addition, you prepare 3-minute recorded presentation describing the story
and relating it to the material from the current or next most recent course unit. The news story must
have been published no more than 12 months before the presentation.
* You will turn the SADIE and a .pdf or link to the story into the Canvas site AND bring a paper copy
to class (if meeting in person).  You will sign up for presentation weeks during the discussion section
in week 2.
For more specific instructions, consult the “SADIE Assignment Specifics” document (Canvas).
Paper 1 (20%)
Your first paper will consider some ethical issue surrounding data and algorithms using ideas
developed in class.  I will distribute a document outlining in more detail the specifics of paper one via
Canvas.  The paper will be completed in stages:
Initial draft: Due at the end of week 5 / before the start of week 6.
Meet with instructors to discuss draft and writing.
Rewrite/final draft: Due week 7.
Paper 2 (20%)
Your second paper will be similar to paper 1 in that it will consider some ethical issue surrounding
data and algorithms using ideas developed in class. However, it will require more extensive
background research and a more developed argument. Like paper 1, it will be completed in stages:
Draft: Due week 13 in Canvas.
Peer review: Week 14.
Rewrite/final draft: Finals week.
Critical book review (20%)
Finally, you will complete a critical book review presentation. I will distribute a document outlining in
more detail the specifics of the book review via Canvas.  The book presentation will be recorded in
the highly-structured “Ignite” format, conducted in discussion sections weeks 12-14.
Assignments: Non Comm B sections (3 credits)
QCCs (Question, Comment, or Criticism) (20%)
QCCs are your regular interaction with the course material. For some QCCs, you will be given a
specific writing prompt related to a learning outcome of that week, but others are more generic and
are described here. These are short writings (roughly 100 words) that raise a thoughtful question,
comment, or criticism on the week's readings. Good QCCs demonstrate that you've read and
understood the material, and raise a question,  insightful comment, or useful criticism about a key
part of the reading. Superficial questions, offhand comments, or criticisms that simply state an
opinion (rather than raise an objection that you explain) are will often not receive full credit. QCCs are
due each week, and they are graded pass/fail.
Exams (2, each worth 20%)
There will be two exams, each open book and timed. They take place in weeks 7 and 14-15.
Case Study Project (20% individual, 20% group)
You, along with several of your classmates, will be required to develop a substantial data ethics case
study. This project as a whole is intended to foster depth of understanding of both value theory and
particular issues in information ethics and policy. It is also intended to develop your ability to conduct
independent research, manage a project, and write sophisticated papers.
The project will include a rich description of a particular data problem and context, a policy analysis
of potential solutions to the problem, and an analysis of the moral considerations at work in the policy
analysis. The project is broken into several parts to scaffold your learning. We will provide further
guidance during week 2.
CLASS IN THE TIME OF COVID
There are a number of changes and expectations to this course that are a result of the COVID.
Specifically, we must prioritize our collective health and safety to keep ourselves, our campus, and
our community safe. As a university community, we must work together to prevent the spread of the
virus and to promote the collective health and welfare of our campus and surrounding community.
You are each expected to read and abide by the UW-MADISON BADGER PLEDGE
(https://smartrestart.wisc.edu/badgerpledge/)         
Likewise, you are each required to adhere to the UW-MADISON FACE COVERING
GUIDELINES (https://d1cjb8q1w2lzm7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2020/06/Clothface-cover-guidance-06-22-20-final.pdf)
While on campus all employees and students are required to wear appropriate and properly fitting
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wear-cloth-facecoverings.html) face coverings while present in any campus building unless working alone in a
laboratory or office space.
Face Coverings During In-person Instruction Statement (COVID19)
Individuals are expected to wear a face covering while inside any university building. Face coverings
must be worn correctly (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-towear-cloth-face-coverings.html) (i.e., covering both your mouth and nose) in the building if you      are
attending class in person. If any student is unable to wear a face-covering, an         accommodation
may be provided due to disability, medical condition, or other legitimate reason.
Students with disabilities or medical conditions who are unable to wear a face covering should
contact the McBurney Disability Resource Center (https://mcburney.wisc.edu/) or their Access
Consultant if they are already    affiliated. Students requesting an accommodation unrelated to
disability or medical condition, should contact the Dean of Students Office.
Students who choose not to wear a face covering may not attend in-person classes, unless they are
approved for an accommodation or exemption. All other students not wearing a face covering will be
asked to put one on or leave the classroom. Students who refuse to wear face coverings
appropriately or adhere to other stated requirements will be reported to the Office of Student
Conduct and Community Standards (https://conduct.students.wisc.edu/) and will not be allowed
to return to the classroom until they agree to comply with the face covering policy. An instructor may
cancel or suspend a course in-person meeting if a person is in the classroom without an approved
face covering in position over their nose and mouth and refuses to immediately comply.
NOTE: for LIS 461 (once meeting in person, if that happens this semester), Professor
Hutchins requires that his TAs dismiss discussion section if any student fails to adhere to the
face covering requirement. The student will receive a failing grade for the course. To be clear,
that decision is not within the TAs’ discretion. Complaints about that should go directly to
Professor Hutchins of the UW Dean of Students.
QUARANTINE OR ISOLATION DUE TO COVID-19
Students should continually monitor themselves for COVID-19 symptoms
(https://healthscreen.wisc.edu/) and get tested (https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/medical/testing/) for the
virus if they have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. Student
should reach out to instructors as soon as possible if they become ill or need to isolate or quarantine,
in order to make alternate plans for how to proceed with the course. Students are strongly
encouraged to communicate with their instructor concerning their illness and the anticipated extent of
their absence from the course (either in-person or remote). The instructor will work with the student
to provide alternative ways to complete the course work.
COURSE EVALUATIONS
Students will be provided with an opportunity to evaluate this course and your learning experience.
Student participation is an integral component of this course, and your feedback is important to me. I
strongly encourage you to participate in the course evaluation.
UW-Madison now uses an online course evaluation survey tool, AEFIS
(https://kb.wisc.edu/luwmad/page.php?id=81069) . In most instances, you will receive an official email
two weeks prior to the end of the semester when your course evaluation is available. You will receive
a link to log into the course evaluation with your NetID where you can complete the evaluation and
submit it, anonymously. Your participation is an     integral component of this course, and your
feedback is important to me. I strongly encourage  you to participate in the course evaluation.
ACADEMIC CALENDAR & RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
See: https://secfac.wisc.edu/academic-calendar/#religious-observances
(https://secfac.wisc.edu/academic-calendar/#religious-observances)
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT
By virtue of enrollment, each student agrees to uphold the high academic standards of the University
of Wisconsin-Madison; academic misconduct is behavior that negatively impacts the integrity of the
institution. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit
these previously listed acts are examples of misconduct which may result in disciplinary action.
Examples of disciplinary action include, but is not limited to, failure on the assignment/course, written
reprimand, disciplinary probation, suspension, or expulsion.
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES STATEMENT
The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal
educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12),
and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be
reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students
with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty
[me] of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or
as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty [I], will work either
directly with the student [you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide
reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional
accommodations as part of a student's educational record, is confidential and protected under
FERPA. (See: McBurney Disability Resource Center (https://mcburney.wisc.edu/) )
DIVERSITY & INCLUSION STATEMENT
Diversity (https://diversity.wisc.edu/) is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UWMadison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity,
culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We
commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as
inextricably linked goals.
The University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive
community for people from every background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve
Wisconsin and the world.
Conduct
In addition to UW-Madison standards, we adopt the following ground rules for discussions:
Listen actively and attentively.
Ask for clarification if you are confused.
Do not interrupt one another.
Challenge one another, but do so respectfully.
Critique ideas, not people.
Avoid put-downs (even humorous ones).
Take responsibility for the quality of the discussion.
Build on one another’s comments to work toward shared understanding.
Do not monopolize discussion.
Speak from your own experience, without generalizing.
If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.
Consider anything that is said in class to be strictly confidential.
Arrive on time.
Turn your cell phone off.
Use laptops only for legitimate class activities (note-taking, assigned tasks).
Do not leave class early without okaying it with the session instructor in advance.
Ask questions if you are confused.
Try not to distract or annoy your classmates.
Be kind to others: Do not insult or put down classmates or faculty. Behave professionally.
Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate here.
No back-seat driving: If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn't
intermittently lob advice across the room.
Agenda
Readings marked with an asterisk (*) are scholarly, and generally more demanding than readings

 Course Description
 This course is an intensive introduction to and overview of some foundational issues in ethical issues
 surrounding the collection, analysis, and use of data in a variety of contexts. We will cover
 theoretical, legal, and policy-level approaches to several issues that are probably already familiar to
 you. There are two primary components to your work. First is engagement with the course material.
 You will be responsible for reading and critically assessing the course materials, and engaging with
 the rest of the class regarding those materials, each week. Second is a substantial case study on a
 data problem of your choice.
 This is a 3-credit hour or a 4-credit hour course. One credit is the learning that takes place in at least
 45 hours of learning activities, which include time in lectures or class meetings, in person or online,
 labs, exams, presentations, tutorials, reading, writing, studying, preparation for any of these activities,
 and any other learning activities.
 Required Texts
 Hannah Fry, Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms (2018) (ISBN: 0393357368). This is
 very easy-to-read book that provides some background information for several course units. It's
 inexpensive, widely available, and in multiple formats (electronic, paperback, audio).
 Other readings will be made available each week in the weekly Canvas modules
 Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
 After completing this course, students will be able to:
 Identify, analyze, and evaluate moral problems in collecting, analyzing, and using data.
 Distinguish and explain different types of moral concerns in data collection, analysis, and use,
 including (inter alia) harm, discrimination, procedural unfairness, respect for persons, and
 democratic legitimacy.
 Explain and evaluate key moral issues surrounding data collection, analysis, and use in a variety
 of domains, including (inter alia): commerce, healthcare, research, law enforcement and security,
 education, and social media.
 Understand the various philosophical theories, issues, and ideas that we address and apply
 those theories, issues, and ideas to problems in data and ethics.
 Examine and critique the arguments we encounter, and to bring original and creative ideas to
 bear on those arguments.
 Grading
 A student’s final letter grade will be based on the following:
 A: 94+%
 AB: 88+%
 B: 82+%
 BC: 77+%
 C: 72+%
 D: 60+%
 F: below 60%
 A student’s final number grade will be distributed across assignments as follows:
 Assignments: Comm B sections (4 credits)
 Participation (10%)
 A key component of this course is your regular, active, and thoughtful participation in discussion
 sections. We will not grade on mere attendance; rather, we will consider your participation in
 discussion your classmates’ presentations and in peer review exercises. You will be graded on
 quality of contributions during both lecture and discussion. For the asynchronous Comm B students,
 this will include work with your ""writing group"" in Memo Discussions.
 Memos – 10% total (2% each memo)
 You will write five short memos (roughly one page, double-spaced, or 300 words) on questions I pose
 about the course readings. You will use these during discussion sections to work on writing. The first
 several will go through peer review and then be graded by your TA or instructor.
 *You will turn memos in via Canvas AND bring a paper copy to discussion section (if in person) for
 peer-review.
 For more specific instructions, consult the “Memo Assignment Specifics” document (Canvas).
 Stories about Algorithms, Data, Information, and Ethics (SADIEs)—
 20% total (5% each paper, 5% each presentation)
 Twice during the semester you will be required to find a recent news story about a data or algorithm
 issue, trend, case, technology, law, practice, or related matter, and prepare a summary of the story
 and its relation to course content in a paper of two-three pages, completed before the start of
 discussion that week . In addition, you prepare 3-minute recorded presentation describing the story
 and relating it to the material from the current or next most recent course unit. The news story must
 have been published no more than 12 months before the presentation.
 * You will turn the SADIE and a .pdf or link to the story into the Canvas site AND bring a paper copy
 to class (if meeting in person). You will sign up for presentation weeks during the discussion section
 in week 2.
 For more specific instructions, consult the “SADIE Assignment Specifics” document (Canvas).
 Paper 1 (20%)
 Your first paper will consider some ethical issue surrounding data and algorithms using ideas
 developed in class. I will distribute a document outlining in more detail the specifics of paper one via
 Canvas. The paper will be completed in stages:
 Initial draft: Due at the end of week 5 / before the start of week 6.
 Meet with instructors to discuss draft and writing.
 Rewrite/final draft: Due week 7.
 Paper 2 (20%)
 Your second paper will be similar to paper 1 in that it will consider some ethical issue surrounding
 data and algorithms using ideas developed in class. However, it will require more extensive
 background research and a more developed argument. Like paper 1, it will be completed in stages:
 Draft: Due week 13 in Canvas.
 Peer review: Week 14.
 Rewrite/final draft: Finals week.
 Critical book review (20%)
 Finally, you will complete a critical book review presentation. I will distribute a document outlining in
 more detail the specifics of the book review via Canvas. The book presentation will be recorded in
 the highly-structured “Ignite” format, conducted in discussion sections weeks 12-14.
 Assignments: Non Comm B sections (3 credits)
 QCCs (Question, Comment, or Criticism) (20%)
 QCCs are your regular interaction with the course material. For some QCCs, you will be given a
 specific writing prompt related to a learning outcome of that week, but others are more generic and
 are described here. These are short writings (roughly 100 words) that raise a thoughtful question,
 comment, or criticism on the week's readings. Good QCCs demonstrate that you've read and
 understood the material, and raise a question, insightful comment, or useful criticism about a key
 part of the reading. Superficial questions, offhand comments, or criticisms that simply state an
 opinion (rather than raise an objection that you explain) are will often not receive full credit. QCCs are
 due each week, and they are graded pass/fail.
 Exams (2, each worth 20%)
 There will be two exams, each open book and timed. They take place in weeks 7 and 14-15.
 Case Study Project (20% individual, 20% group)
 You, along with several of your classmates, will be required to develop a substantial data ethics case
 study. This project as a whole is intended to foster depth of understanding of both value theory and
 particular issues in information ethics and policy. It is also intended to develop your ability to conduct
 independent research, manage a project, and write sophisticated papers.
 The project will include a rich description of a particular data problem and context, a policy analysis
 of potential solutions to the problem, and an analysis of the moral considerations at work in the policy
 analysis. The project is broken into several parts to scaffold your learning. We will provide further
 guidance during week 2.
 CLASS IN THE TIME OF COVID
 There are a number of changes and expectations to this course that are a result of the COVID.
 Specifically, we must prioritize our collective health and safety to keep ourselves, our campus, and
 our community safe. As a university community, we must work together to prevent the spread of the
 virus and to promote the collective health and welfare of our campus and surrounding community.
 You are each expected to read and abide by the UW-MADISON BADGER PLEDGE
 (https://smartrestart.wisc.edu/badgerpledge/) 
 Likewise, you are each required to adhere to the UW-MADISON FACE COVERING
 GUIDELINES (https://d1cjb8q1w2lzm7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2020/06/Clothface-cover-guidance-06-22-20-final.pdf)
 While on campus all employees and students are required to wear appropriate and properly fitting
 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wear-cloth-facecoverings.html) face coverings while present in any campus building unless working alone in a
 laboratory or office space.
 Face Coverings During In-person Instruction Statement (COVID19)
 Individuals are expected to wear a face covering while inside any university building. Face coverings
 must be worn correctly (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-towear-cloth-face-coverings.html) (i.e., covering both your mouth and nose) in the building if you are
 attending class in person. If any student is unable to wear a face-covering, an accommodation
 may be provided due to disability, medical condition, or other legitimate reason.
 Students with disabilities or medical conditions who are unable to wear a face covering should
 contact the McBurney Disability Resource Center (https://mcburney.wisc.edu/) or their Access
 Consultant if they are already affiliated. Students requesting an accommodation unrelated to
 disability or medical condition, should contact the Dean of Students Office.
 Students who choose not to wear a face covering may not attend in-person classes, unless they are
 approved for an accommodation or exemption. All other students not wearing a face covering will be
 asked to put one on or leave the classroom. Students who refuse to wear face coverings
 appropriately or adhere to other stated requirements will be reported to the Office of Student
 Conduct and Community Standards (https://conduct.students.wisc.edu/) and will not be allowed
 to return to the classroom until they agree to comply with the face covering policy. An instructor may
 cancel or suspend a course in-person meeting if a person is in the classroom without an approved
 face covering in position over their nose and mouth and refuses to immediately comply.
 NOTE: for LIS 461 (once meeting in person, if that happens this semester), Professor
 Hutchins requires that his TAs dismiss discussion section if any student fails to adhere to the
 face covering requirement. The student will receive a failing grade for the course. To be clear,
 that decision is not within the TAs’ discretion. Complaints about that should go directly to
 Professor Hutchins of the UW Dean of Students.
 QUARANTINE OR ISOLATION DUE TO COVID-19
 Students should continually monitor themselves for COVID-19 symptoms
 (https://healthscreen.wisc.edu/) and get tested (https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/medical/testing/) for the
 virus if they have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. Student
 should reach out to instructors as soon as possible if they become ill or need to isolate or quarantine,
 in order to make alternate plans for how to proceed with the course. Students are strongly
 encouraged to communicate with their instructor concerning their illness and the anticipated extent of
 their absence from the course (either in-person or remote). The instructor will work with the student
 to provide alternative ways to complete the course work.
 COURSE EVALUATIONS
 Students will be provided with an opportunity to evaluate this course and your learning experience.
 Student participation is an integral component of this course, and your feedback is important to me. I
 strongly encourage you to participate in the course evaluation.
 UW-Madison now uses an online course evaluation survey tool, AEFIS
 (https://kb.wisc.edu/luwmad/page.php?id=81069) . In most instances, you will receive an official email
 two weeks prior to the end of the semester when your course evaluation is available. You will receive
 a link to log into the course evaluation with your NetID where you can complete the evaluation and
 submit it, anonymously. Your participation is an integral component of this course, and your
 feedback is important to me. I strongly encourage you to participate in the course evaluation.
 ACADEMIC CALENDAR & RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
 See: https://secfac.wisc.edu/academic-calendar/#religious-observances
 (https://secfac.wisc.edu/academic-calendar/#religious-observances)
 ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT
 By virtue of enrollment, each student agrees to uphold the high academic standards of the University
 of Wisconsin-Madison; academic misconduct is behavior that negatively impacts the integrity of the
 institution. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit
 these previously listed acts are examples of misconduct which may result in disciplinary action.
 Examples of disciplinary action include, but is not limited to, failure on the assignment/course, written
 reprimand, disciplinary probation, suspension, or expulsion.
 ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES STATEMENT
 The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal
 educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12),
 and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be
 reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students
 with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty
 [me] of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or
 as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty [I], will work either
 directly with the student [you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide
 reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional
 accommodations as part of a student's educational record, is confidential and protected under
 FERPA. (See: McBurney Disability Resource Center (https://mcburney.wisc.edu/) )
 DIVERSITY & INCLUSION STATEMENT
 Diversity (https://diversity.wisc.edu/) is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UWMadison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity,
 culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We
 commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as
 inextricably linked goals.
 The University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive
 community for people from every background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve
 Wisconsin and the world.
 Conduct
 In addition to UW-Madison standards, we adopt the following ground rules for discussions:
 Listen actively and attentively.
 Ask for clarification if you are confused.
 Do not interrupt one another.
 Challenge one another, but do so respectfully.
 Critique ideas, not people.
 Avoid put-downs (even humorous ones).
 Take responsibility for the quality of the discussion.
 Build on one another’s comments to work toward shared understanding.
 Do not monopolize discussion.
 Speak from your own experience, without generalizing.
 If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.
 Consider anything that is said in class to be strictly confidential.
 Arrive on time.
 Turn your cell phone off.
 Use laptops only for legitimate class activities (note-taking, assigned tasks).
 Do not leave class early without okaying it with the session instructor in advance.
 Ask questions if you are confused.
 Try not to distract or annoy your classmates.
 Be kind to others: Do not insult or put down classmates or faculty. Behave professionally.
 Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate here.
 No back-seat driving: If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn't
 intermittently lob advice across the room.

 surrounding the collection, analysis, and use of data in a variety of contexts. We will cover
 theoretical, legal, and policy-level approaches to several issues that are probably already familiar to
 you. There are two primary components to your work. First is engagement with the course material.
 You will be responsible for reading and critically assessing the course materials, and engaging with
 the rest of the class regarding those materials, each week. Second is a substantial case study on a
 data problem of your choice.
 This is a 3-credit hour or a 4-credit hour course. One credit is the learning that takes place in at least
 45 hours of learning activities, which include time in lectures or class meetings, in person or online,
 labs, exams, presentations, tutorials, reading, writing, studying, preparation for any of these activities,
 and any other learning activities.
 Required Texts
Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms. This is
 very easy-to-read book that provides some background information for several course units. It's
 inexpensive, widely available, and in multiple formats (electronic, paperback, audio).
 Other readings will be made available each week in the weekly Canvas modules
 Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
 After completing this course, students will be able to:
 Identify, analyze, and evaluate moral problems in collecting, analyzing, and using data.
 Distinguish and explain different types of moral concerns in data collection, analysis, and use,
 including (inter alia) harm, discrimination, procedural unfairness, respect for persons, and
 democratic legitimacy.
 Explain and evaluate key moral issues surrounding data collection, analysis, and use in a variety
 of domains, including (inter alia): commerce, healthcare, research, law enforcement and security,
 education, and social media.
 Understand the various philosophical theories, issues, and ideas that we address and apply
 those theories, issues, and ideas to problems in data and ethics.
 Examine and critique the arguments we encounter, and to bring original and creative ideas to
 bear on those arguments.
 Grading
 A student’s final letter grade will be based on the following:
 A: 94+%
 AB: 88+%
 B: 82+%
 BC: 77+%
 C: 72+%
 D: 60+%
 F: below 60%
 A student’s final number grade will be distributed across assignments as follows:
 Assignments: Comm B sections (4 credits)
 Participation (10%)
 A key component of this course is your regular, active, and thoughtful participation in discussion
 sections. We will not grade on mere attendance; rather, we will consider your participation in
 discussion your classmates’ presentations and in peer review exercises. You will be graded on
 quality of contributions during both lecture and discussion. For the asynchronous Comm B students,
 this will include work with your ""writing group"" in Memo Discussions.
 Memos – 10% total (2% each memo)
 You will write five short memos (roughly one page, double-spaced, or 300 words) on questions I pose
 about the course readings. You will use these during discussion sections to work on writing. The first
 several will go through peer review and then be graded by your TA or instructor.
 *You will turn memos in via Canvas AND bring a paper copy to discussion section (if in person) for
 peer-review.
 For more specific instructions, consult the “Memo Assignment Specifics” document (Canvas).
 Stories about Algorithms, Data, Information, and Ethics (SADIEs)—
 20% total (5% each paper, 5% each presentation)
 Twice during the semester you will be required to find a recent news story about a data or algorithm
 issue, trend, case, technology, law, practice, or related matter, and prepare a summary of the story
 and its relation to course content in a paper of two-three pages, completed before the start of
 discussion that week . In addition, you prepare 3-minute recorded presentation describing the story
 and relating it to the material from the current or next most recent course unit. The news story must
 have been published no more than 12 months before the presentation.
 * You will turn the SADIE and a .pdf or link to the story into the Canvas site AND bring a paper copy
 to class (if meeting in person). You will sign up for presentation weeks during the discussion section
 in week 2.
 For more specific instructions, consult the “SADIE Assignment Specifics” document (Canvas).
 Paper 1 (20%)
 Your first paper will consider some ethical issue surrounding data and algorithms using ideas
 developed in class. I will distribute a document outlining in more detail the specifics of paper one via
 Canvas. The paper will be completed in stages:
 Initial draft: Due at the end of week 5 / before the start of week 6.
 Meet with instructors to discuss draft and writing.
 Rewrite/final draft: Due week 7.
 Paper 2 (20%)
 Your second paper will be similar to paper 1 in that it will consider some ethical issue surrounding
 data and algorithms using ideas developed in class. However, it will require more extensive
 background research and a more developed argument. Like paper 1, it will be completed in stages:
 Draft: Due week 13 in Canvas.
 Peer review: Week 14.
 Rewrite/final draft: Finals week.
 Critical book review (20%)
 Finally, you will complete a critical book review presentation. I will distribute a document outlining in
 more detail the specifics of the book review via Canvas. The book presentation will be recorded in
 the highly-structured “Ignite” format, conducted in discussion sections weeks 12-14.
 Assignments: Non Comm B sections (3 credits)
 QCCs (Question, Comment, or Criticism) (20%)
 QCCs are your regular interaction with the course material. For some QCCs, you will be given a
 specific writing prompt related to a learning outcome of that week, but others are more generic and
 are described here. These are short writings (roughly 100 words) that raise a thoughtful question,
 comment, or criticism on the week's readings. Good QCCs demonstrate that you've read and
 understood the material, and raise a question, insightful comment, or useful criticism about a key
 part of the reading. Superficial questions, offhand comments, or criticisms that simply state an
 opinion (rather than raise an objection that you explain) are will often not receive full credit. QCCs are
 due each week, and they are graded pass/fail.
 Exams (2, each worth 20%)
 There will be two exams, each open book and timed. They take place in weeks 7 and 14-15.
 Case Study Project (20% individual, 20% group)
 You, along with several of your classmates, will be required to develop a substantial data ethics case
 study. This project as a whole is intended to foster depth of understanding of both value theory and
 particular issues in information ethics and policy. It is also intended to develop your ability to conduct
 independent research, manage a project, and write sophisticated papers.
 The project will include a rich description of a particular data problem and context, a policy analysis
 of potential solutions to the problem, and an analysis of the moral considerations at work in the policy
 analysis. The project is broken into several parts to scaffold your learning. We will provide further
 guidance during week 2.
 CLASS IN THE TIME OF COVID
 There are a number of changes and expectations to this course that are a result of the COVID.
 Specifically, we must prioritize our collective health and safety to keep ourselves, our campus, and
 our community safe. As a university community, we must work together to prevent the spread of the
 virus and to promote the collective health and welfare of our campus and surrounding community.
 You are each expected to read and abide by the UW-MADISON BADGER PLEDGE
 (https://smartrestart.wisc.edu/badgerpledge/) 
 Likewise, you are each required to adhere to the UW-MADISON FACE COVERING
 GUIDELINES (https://d1cjb8q1w2lzm7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2020/06/Clothface-cover-guidance-06-22-20-final.pdf)
 While on campus all employees and students are required to wear appropriate and properly fitting
 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wear-cloth-facecoverings.html) face coverings while present in any campus building unless working alone in a
 laboratory or office space.
 Face Coverings During In-person Instruction Statement (COVID19)
 Individuals are expected to wear a face covering while inside any university building. Face coverings
 must be worn correctly (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-towear-cloth-face-coverings.html) (i.e., covering both your mouth and nose) in the building if you are
 attending class in person. If any student is unable to wear a face-covering, an accommodation
 may be provided due to disability, medical condition, or other legitimate reason.
 Students with disabilities or medical conditions who are unable to wear a face covering should
 contact the McBurney Disability Resource Center (https://mcburney.wisc.edu/) or their Access
 Consultant if they are already affiliated. Students requesting an accommodation unrelated to
 disability or medical condition, should contact the Dean of Students Office.
 Students who choose not to wear a face covering may not attend in-person classes, unless they are
 approved for an accommodation or exemption. All other students not wearing a face covering will be
 asked to put one on or leave the classroom. Students who refuse to wear face coverings
 appropriately or adhere to other stated requirements will be reported to the Office of Student
 Conduct and Community Standards (https://conduct.students.wisc.edu/) and will not be allowed
 to return to the classroom until they agree to comply with the face covering policy. An instructor may
 cancel or suspend a course in-person meeting if a person is in the classroom without an approved
 face covering in position over their nose and mouth and refuses to immediately comply.
 NOTE: for LIS 461 (once meeting in person, if that happens this semester), Professor
 Hutchins requires that his TAs dismiss discussion section if any student fails to adhere to the
 face covering requirement. The student will receive a failing grade for the course. To be clear,
 that decision is not within the TAs’ discretion. Complaints about that should go directly to
 Professor Hutchins of the UW Dean of Students.
 QUARANTINE OR ISOLATION DUE TO COVID-19
 Students should continually monitor themselves for COVID-19 symptoms
 (https://healthscreen.wisc.edu/) and get tested (https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/medical/testing/) for the
 virus if they have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. Student
 should reach out to instructors as soon as possible if they become ill or need to isolate or quarantine,
 in order to make alternate plans for how to proceed with the course. Students are strongly
 encouraged to communicate with their instructor concerning their illness and the anticipated extent of
 their absence from the course (either in-person or remote). The instructor will work with the student
 to provide alternative ways to complete the course work.
 COURSE EVALUATIONS
 Students will be provided with an opportunity to evaluate this course and your learning experience.
 Student participation is an integral component of this course, and your feedback is important to me. I
 strongly encourage you to participate in the course evaluation.
 UW-Madison now uses an online course evaluation survey tool, AEFIS
 (https://kb.wisc.edu/luwmad/page.php?id=81069) . In most instances, you will receive an official email
 two weeks prior to the end of the semester when your course evaluation is available. You will receive
 a link to log into the course evaluation with your NetID where you can complete the evaluation and
 submit it, anonymously. Your participation is an integral component of this course, and your
 feedback is important to me. I strongly encourage you to participate in the course evaluation.
 ACADEMIC CALENDAR & RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
 See: https://secfac.wisc.edu/academic-calendar/#religious-observances
 (https://secfac.wisc.edu/academic-calendar/#religious-observances)
 ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT
 By virtue of enrollment, each student agrees to uphold the high academic standards of the University
 of Wisconsin-Madison; academic misconduct is behavior that negatively impacts the integrity of the
 institution. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit
 these previously listed acts are examples of misconduct which may result in disciplinary action.
 Examples of disciplinary action include, but is not limited to, failure on the assignment/course, written
 reprimand, disciplinary probation, suspension, or expulsion.
 ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES STATEMENT
 The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal
 educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12),
 and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be
 reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students
 with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty
 [me] of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or
 as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty [I], will work either
 directly with the student [you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide
 reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional
 accommodations as part of a student's educational record, is confidential and protected under
 FERPA. (See: McBurney Disability Resource Center (https://mcburney.wisc.edu/) )
 DIVERSITY & INCLUSION STATEMENT
 Diversity (https://diversity.wisc.edu/) is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UWMadison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity,
 culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We
 commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as
 inextricably linked goals.
 The University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive
 community for people from every background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve
 Wisconsin and the world.
 Conduct
 In addition to UW-Madison standards, we adopt the following ground rules for discussions:
 Listen actively and attentively.
 Ask for clarification if you are confused.
 Do not interrupt one another.
 Challenge one another, but do so respectfully.
 Critique ideas, not people.
 Avoid put-downs (even humorous ones).
 Take responsibility for the quality of the discussion.
 Build on one another’s comments to work toward shared understanding.
 Do not monopolize discussion.
 Speak from your own experience, without generalizing.
 If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.
 Consider anything that is said in class to be strictly confidential.
 Arrive on time.
 Turn your cell phone off.
 Use laptops only for legitimate class activities (note-taking, assigned tasks).
 Do not leave class early without okaying it with the session instructor in advance.
 Ask questions if you are confused.
 Try not to distract or annoy your classmates.
 Be kind to others: Do not insult or put down classmates or faculty. Behave professionally.
 Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate here.
 No back-seat driving: If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn't
 intermittently lob advice across the room.

DESCRIPTION
This course examines the production and consumption of energy from a systems perspective.
Sustainability is examined by studying global and regional environmental impacts, economics, energy
efficiency, consumption patterns and energy policy. First, the physics of energy and energy accounting
methods are introduced. Next, the current energy system that encompasses resource extraction,
conversion processes and end-uses are covered. Responses to current challenges such as declining fossil
fuels and climate change are explored with an emphasis on emerging renewable energy technologies
(e.g., biomass, wind, and photovoltaics), building technologies, alternative vehicle technologies, and
end-use efficiency and conservation.
This is an interdisciplinary course that integrates the following analytical tools for advancing energy
sustainability: Technology Assessment
Economic and Policy Analysis
Energy Analysis and Environmental Sustainability Assessment
Students from SNRE, Engineering, Public Policy, Business, and other fields provide important
perspectives useful for transforming energy systems to enhance sustainability.

FORMAT
Learning in this course is facilitated through lecture, readings, discussion, in class exercises, assignments,
and term projects. Analytical skills are developed and demonstrated through problem sets, a term
project and the mid-term and final exams. Required readings on canvas reinforce topics and concepts
covered in lecture; reference materials on Canvas (optional reading) include supplemental articles,
reports, data and web sites. For On-Campus students, class participation is a key element of the course
and critical analysis and discussion of course topics is expected in class and through the blog. OffCampus students are expected to participate by contributing to the blog.

 DESCRIPTION
 This course examines the production and consumption of energy from a systems perspective.
 Sustainability is examined by studying global and regional environmental impacts, economics, energy
 efficiency, consumption patterns and energy policy. First, the physics of energy and energy accounting
 methods are introduced. Next, the current energy system that encompasses resource extraction,
 conversion processes and end-uses are covered. Responses to current challenges such as declining fossil
 fuels and climate change are explored with an emphasis on emerging renewable energy technologies
 (e.g., biomass, wind, and photovoltaics), building technologies, alternative vehicle technologies, and
 end-use efficiency and conservation.
 This is an interdisciplinary course that integrates the following analytical tools for advancing energy
 sustainability: Technology Assessment
 Economic and Policy Analysis
 Energy Analysis and Environmental Sustainability Assessment
 Students from SNRE, Engineering, Public Policy, Business, and other fields provide important
 perspectives useful for transforming energy systems to enhance sustainability. 
 2
 FORMAT
 Learning in this course is facilitated through lecture, readings, discussion, in class exercises, assignments,
 and term projects. Analytical skills are developed and demonstrated through problem sets, a term
 project and the mid-term and final exams. Required readings on canvas reinforce topics and concepts
 covered in lecture; reference materials on Canvas (optional reading) include supplemental articles,
 reports, data and web sites. For On-Campus students, class participation is a key element of the course
 and critical analysis and discussion of course topics is expected in class and through the blog. OffCampus students are expected to participate by contributing to the blog.

 DESCRIPTION
 This course examines the production and consumption of energy from a systems perspective.
 Sustainability is examined by studying global and regional environmental impacts, economics, energy
 efficiency, consumption patterns and energy policy. First, the physics of energy and energy accounting
 methods are introduced. Next, the current energy system that encompasses resource extraction,
 conversion processes and end-uses are covered. Responses to current challenges such as declining fossil
 fuels and climate change are explored with an emphasis on emerging renewable energy technologies
 (e.g., biomass, wind, and photovoltaics), building technologies, alternative vehicle technologies, and
 end-use efficiency and conservation.
 This is an interdisciplinary course that integrates the following analytical tools for advancing energy
 sustainability: Technology Assessment
 Economic and Policy Analysis
 Energy Analysis and Environmental Sustainability Assessment
 Students from SNRE, Engineering, Public Policy, Business, and other fields provide important
 perspectives useful for transforming energy systems to enhance sustainability.

 FORMAT
 Learning in this course is facilitated through lecture, readings, discussion, in class exercises, assignments,
 and term projects. Analytical skills are developed and demonstrated through problem sets, a term
 project and the mid-term and final exams. Required readings on canvas reinforce topics and concepts
 covered in lecture; reference materials on Canvas (optional reading) include supplemental articles,
 reports, data and web sites. For On-Campus students, class participation is a key element of the course
 and critical analysis and discussion of course topics is expected in class and through the blog. OffCampus students are expected to participate by contributing to the blog.

MIT,STS.005 Data and Society,http://edenmedina.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/STS005%20Syllabus%205-16-22.pdf,Found," STS.005/11.155/IDS.057 Data and Society Spring 2022 TR 11-12:30 (56-162) Instructors: Eden Medina Program in Science, Technology, and Society E51-180 | eden@mit.edu | (617) 253-1943 Office Hours: by appointment Sarah Williams Department of Urban Studies and Planning 10-404 | sew@mit.edu | Office Hours: dusp.mit.edu/oh TA: Mariel García-Montes Program in Science, Technology, and Society marielgm@mit.edu Office Hours: by appointment 2 Description The course will introduce students to the social, political, and ethical aspects of data science work. It is designed to create reflective practitioners who are able to think critically about how collecting, aggregating, and analyzing data are social processes, and processes that affect people. Students will also be asked to consider how they view their obligation to those who produce the data that data scientists collect and analyze. Students will be expected to participate in class discussions and complete homework assignments. There will be a final project. Objectives By the completion of the course students will: (1) recognize how social contexts and human values shape the creation of data sets, algorithms, and models; (2) recognize how the large-scale collection of data, and the automated systems that utilize these data, can affect people, communities, and organizations. (3) identify emergent social, political, legal, and ethical challenges in data science and related fields. (4) apply what they have learned in a class project on a current event. Grading Final grades will be calculated according to the following: 60% Homework assignments 30% Final Project 10% Participation Final Project The final project will encourage students to position the practices and methods of data science in an interdisciplinary context in order to address a highly complex and challenging problem without a clear solution. Students will present their work in a final presentation. Classroom Behavior Everyone is expected to conduct themselves professionally during class. This includes arriving on time. Arriving late or using laptops or other devices for entertainment distracts everyone. Professional behavior also entails being respectful of others and their opinions—even and especially when you do not agree with them. Attendance Attendance will be taken in class and will form part of the final participation grade. Attendance is mandatory on presentation days. Students needing to miss a class 3 presentation because of a serious illness or a personal tragedy will need to receive advance approval from S^3 and provide supporting documentation if requested. Late Policy Turning in assignments promptly is important both for keeping up with course material and to keep all students on a relatively level playing field. A late assignment will be accepted up until one week after the original due date for a loss of one letter grade (e.g., an A becomes an A-). After that point, late assignments will receive no credit and will not be accepted. There will of course be situations where we are willing to bend these rules. We will strive to respect you by taking your requests seriously if you similarly strive to not take advantage of our inclination to respect them. We’re all in this weird boat together---let’s be good to each other. Student Conduct, Rights, and Responsibilities All students are expected to submit their own original work. Plagiarism constitutes using others’ ideas, words or images without properly giving credit to those sources. If you turn in any work with your name affixed to it, I assume that work is your own and that all sources are indicated and documented in the text (with quotations and/or citations). For more information on expectations for student conduct please refer to the MIT handbook on academic integrity available online at http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity/. Student Support Services and Student Disability Services Every attempt will be made to accommodate qualified students with personal or medical issues that may affect the student’s ability to attend class and complete assignments. Students requesting this kind of accommodation must contact and receive verification from Student Support Services (S 3 ). Students may contact S 3 by emailing s3-support@mit.edu or calling 617-253-4861. More information is available online at http://studentlife.mit.edu/s3.

Students with disabilities who need accommodations should contact Disability and Access Services (DAS) as soon as possible by emailing das-student@mit.edu or calling 617-253-1674. Students should also let the instructor know of any approved accommodations as soon as possible so that arrangements can be made in a timely fashion.

Chen (email: georgechen ♣ cmu.edu) — replace “♣” with an “at” symbol Time and location: (lectures) Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1:25pm-2:45pm HBH 1202, (recitations) Fridays 4:40pm- 6:00pm HBH 1202 TAs: • Abhirup Panja (apanja ♣ andrew.cmu.edu) • Yashasvi Madhukumar (ymadhuku ♣ andrew.cmu.edu) Office hours: TBA (see course webpage/Canvas) Course webpage: www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/94-775/ Course description: Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as “unstructured”. This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach: (1) We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. (2) Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. There is a final project in this course which must address a policy question. How this course differs from 95-865 “Unstructured Data Analysis”: 95-865 emphasizes more of the technical skill development (assessed through two in-class exams involving coding), and does not have any sort of policy focus. 94-775 has a policy-focused final project instead of a final exam. 94-775 does not require cloud computing (part of 95-865 requires the use of Google Colab). Despite these differences, there is heavy material overlap between 94-775 and 95-865. Learning objectives: By the end of the course, students are expected to have developed the following skills: • Recall and discuss common methods for exploratory and predictive analysis of unstructured data • Write Python code for exploratory and predictive data analysis • Apply unstructured data analysis techniques discussed in class to solve problems faced by governments and companies Skills are assessed by homework assignments, a quiz, and a final project. The homework and quiz are meant to be done individually whereas the final project is done in groups. Prerequisites: If you are a Heinz student, then you must have completed 95-791 “Data Mining” and one of either 90-819 “Intermediate Programming with Python” or 95-888 “Data-Focused Python”. If you are not a Heinz student and would like to take the course, please contact the instructor and clearly state what Python courses you have taken/what Python experience you have. Instructional materials: There is no official textbook for the course. We will provide reading material as needed. Homework: There are 3 homework assignments that give hands-on experience with techniques discussed in class. Assignments involve coding in Python and are submitted via Canvas. Grading: Grades will be determined using the following weights: 1 CMU 94-775 UNSTRUCTURED DATA ANALYTICS FOR POLICY (SPRING 2022 MINI 4 SECTION A4, 6 UNITS; CROSSLISTED ALSO AS 94-475) 2 Assignment Percentage of grade HW1 12% HW2 12% HW3 (shorter than HW1 and HW2) 6% Final project proposal 10% Quiz 30%* Final project 30% Letter grades are assigned using a curve. Note that HW3 is designed to be shorter than HW1 and HW2 so that you have more time to work on the final project. *Students with the most instructor-endorsed posts on Piazza will get a bonus of up to 5 points on the quiz (so that it is possible to get 105 out of 100 points). Cheating and plagiarism: In short, the only part of this course that is meant to be a group effort is the final project. While you are welcome to discuss homework problems with classmates, you must write up solutions to homework assignments on your own. At no time during the course should you have access to anyone else’s code to any of the homework assignments including shared via instant messaging, email, Box, Dropbox, GitHub, Bitbucket, Amazon Web Services, etc. If part of your homework code or solutions uses an existing result (e.g., from a book, online resources), please cite your sources. For the quiz, your answers must reflect your work alone. Penalties for cheating range from receiving a 0 on an assignment to failing the course. In extreme circumstances, the instructor may file a case against you recommending the termination of your CMU enrollment. Additional course policies: Late homework: You are allotted a total of two late days that you may use however you wish for the homework assignments. By using a late day, you get a 24-hour extension without penalty. For example: • You could use the two late days on two different assignments to turn them in each 1 day (24 hours) late without penalty. • You could use both late days on a single homework assignment to turn it in 2 days (48 hours) late without penalty. Note that you do not get fractional late days, e.g., you cannot use 1/2 of a late day to get a 12-hour extension. We will keep track of how many late days you have left based on the submission times of your homework assignments on Canvas. Once you have exhausted your late days, work you submit late will not be accepted. This policy only applies to homework; the quiz and final project must be submitted on time to receive any credit. Re-grade policy: If you want an assignment regraded, please write up a note detailing your request and submit it to the instructor. Note that the entire assignment will be regraded and it is possible that your score may be lowered. The course staff will make it clear by what date re-grades for a particular assignment are accepted until. Re-grade requests submitted late will not be processed. Course schedule (subject to revision; see course webpage for most up-to-date calendar): The course is roughly split into two parts. The first part is on exploratory data analysis in which given a dataset, we compute and visualize various aspects of it to try to understand its structure. The second part of the course turns toward making predictions once we have some idea of what structure underlies the data. • Part I: Exploratory data analysis – Week 1: ∗ Lecture 1 (Tue Mar 15): Course overview, basic text analysis ∗ Lecture 2 (Thur Mar 17): Basic text analysis demo, co-occurrence analysis ∗ Recitation (Fri Mar 18): Python review – Week 2: ∗ Lecture 3 (Tue Mar 22): Finding possibly related entities ∗ Lecture 4 (Thur Mar 24): Visualizing high-dimensional data with PCA ∗ HW1 due Thur Mar 24, 11:59pm ∗ Recitation (Fri Mar 25): More on PCA, argsort – Week 3: ∗ Lecture 5 (Tue Mar 29): Manifold learning ∗ Lecture 6 (Thur Mar 31): Clustering I ∗ Recitation slot (Fri Apr 1): Lecture 7 – Clustering II ",,"CMU 94-775 UNSTRUCTURED DATA ANALYTICS FOR POLICY (SPRING 2022 MINI 4 SECTION A4, 6 UNITS; CROSSLISTED ALSO AS 94-475) Instructor:Time and location: (lectures) Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1:25pm-2:45pm HBH 1202, (recitations) Fridays 4:40pm- 6:00pm HBH 1202 TAs: •Office hours: TBA (see course webpage/Canvas) Course webpage: www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/94-775/ Course description: Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video.

Grading: Grades will be determined using the following weights: 1 CMU 94-775 UNSTRUCTURED DATA ANALYTICS FOR POLICY (SPRING 2022 MINI 4 SECTION A4, 6 UNITS; CROSSLISTED ALSO AS 94-475) 2 Assignment Percentage of grade HW1 12% HW2 12% HW3 (shorter than HW1 and HW2) 6% Final project proposal 10% Quiz 30%* Final project 30% Letter grades are assigned using a curve. Note that HW3 is designed to be shorter than HW1 and HW2 so that you have more time to work on the final project. *Students with the most instructor-endorsed posts on Piazza will get a bonus of up to 5 points on the quiz (so that it is possible to get 105 out of 100 points). Cheating and plagiarism: In short, the only part of this course that is meant to be a group effort is the final project. While you are welcome to discuss homework problems with classmates, you must write up solutions to homework assignments on your own. At no time during the course should you have access to anyone else’s code to any of the homework assignments including shared via instant messaging, email, Box, Dropbox, GitHub, Bitbucket, Amazon Web Services, etc. If part of your homework code or solutions uses an existing result (e.g., from a book, online resources), please cite your sources. For the quiz, your answers must reflect your work alone. Penalties for cheating range from receiving a 0 on an assignment to failing the course. In extreme circumstances, the instructor may file a case against you recommending the termination of your CMU enrollment. Additional course policies: Late homework: You are allotted a total of two late days that you may use however you wish for the homework assignments. By using a late day, you get a 24-hour extension without penalty. For example: • You could use the two late days on two different assignments to turn them in each 1 day (24 hours) late without penalty. • You could use both late days on a single homework assignment to turn it in 2 days (48 hours) late without penalty. Note that you do not get fractional late days, e.g., you cannot use 1/2 of a late day to get a 12-hour extension. We will keep track of how many late days you have left based on the submission times of your homework assignments on Canvas. Once you have exhausted your late days, work you submit late will not be accepted. This policy only applies to homework; the quiz and final project must be submitted on time to receive any credit. Re-grade policy: If you want an assignment regraded, please write up a note detailing your request and submit it to the instructor. Note that the entire assignment will be regraded and it is possible that your score may be lowered. The course staff will make it clear by what date re-grades for a particular assignment are accepted until. Re-grade requests submitted late will not be processed. Course schedule (subject to revision; see course webpage for most up-to-date calendar): The course is roughly split into two parts. The first part is on exploratory data analysis in which given a dataset, we compute and visualize various aspects of it to try to understand its structure. The second part of the course turns toward making predictions once we have some idea of what structure underlies the data. • Part I: Exploratory data analysis – Week 1: ∗ Lecture 1 (Tue Mar 15): Course overview, basic text analysis ∗ Lecture 2 (Thur Mar 17): Basic text analysis demo, co-occurrence analysis ∗ Recitation (Fri Mar 18): Python review – Week 2: ∗ Lecture 3 (Tue Mar 22): Finding possibly related entities ∗ Lecture 4 (Thur Mar 24): Visualizing high-dimensional data with PCA ∗ HW1 due Thur Mar 24, 11:59pm ∗ Recitation (Fri Mar 25): More on PCA, argsort – Week 3: ∗ Lecture 5 (Tue Mar 29): Manifold learning ∗ Lecture 6 (Thur Mar 31): Clustering I ∗ Recitation slot (Fri Apr 1): Lecture 7 – Clustering II","CMU 94-775 UNSTRUCTURED DATA ANALYTICS FOR POLICY (SPRING 2022 MINI 4 SECTION A4, 6 UNITS; CROSSLISTED ALSO AS 94-475) Instructor:Time and location: (lectures) Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1:25pm-2:45pm HBH 1202, (recitations) Fridays 4:40pm- 6:00pm HBH 1202 TAs: •Office hours: TBA (see course webpage/Canvas) Course webpage: www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/94-775/ Course description: Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as “unstructured”. This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach: (1) We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. (2) Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. There is a final project in this course which must address a policy question. How this course differs from 95-865 “Unstructured Data Analysis”: 95-865 emphasizes more of the technical skill development (assessed through two in-class exams involving coding), and does not have any sort of policy focus. 94-775 has a policy-focused final project instead of a final exam. 94-775 does not require cloud computing (part of 95-865 requires the use of Google Colab). Despite these differences, there is heavy material overlap between 94-775 and 95-865. Learning objectives: By the end of the course, students are expected to have developed the following skills: • Recall and discuss common methods for exploratory and predictive analysis of unstructured data • Write Python code for exploratory and predictive data analysis • Apply unstructured data analysis techniques discussed in class to solve problems faced by governments and companies Skills are assessed by homework assignments, a quiz, and a final project. The homework and quiz are meant to be done individually whereas the final project is done in groups. Prerequisites: If you are a Heinz student, then you must have completed 95-791 “Data Mining” and one of either 90-819 “Intermediate Programming with Python” or 95-888 “Data-Focused Python”. If you are not a Heinz student and would like to take the course, please contact the instructor and clearly state what Python courses you have taken/what Python experience you have.

Carnegie Mellon,Managing Disruptive Technologies,https://api.heinz.cmu.edu/courses_api/course/syllabus/248427/,Found,"Managing Disruptive Technologies (MDT) (outline subject to minor changes) Learning objectives: Students will learn fundamental tools to understand how to manage the dynamic aspects of technology-enabled marketplaces as a way to understand industry disruption. They will also develop an understanding of the key elements that need to be evaluated when trying to anticipate and manage disruptive technologies in the marketplace. Course statement and motivation: We live in a rapidly changing world dominated by a myriad of technology-enabled disruptions. As a consequence, there is a strong need for individuals who understand the nature of these innovations and the complex ways in which they may affect marketplaces. In line with this need, this course is about understanding technology-driven disruption from a managerial point of view. The course combines several lectures introducing fundamental concepts of economics and management applied to technology-enabled markets, such as multi-sided platforms, direct and indirect network effects, diffusion and critical mass, market power, economies of scale, winner-takes-all markets, pricing strategies, multi-homing, switching costs, differentiated services, bundling, artificial intelligence/machine learning and the value of data. These lectures are complemented by case studies as well as academic papers looking at specific real-world companies focusing on innovative technologies like social networks, online marketplaces and the sharing economy. Students learn how to anticipate disruptive technologies and are exposed to frameworks and tools to characterize and manage these technologies in the workplace. Prior knowledge: a course in economics is required (e.g. 95710 – economic analysis). Key learning resources: This course pulls materials from different sources to provide the best mix to studying disruption and digital platforms. Appropriate readings selected by the instructor will be available on the course website. Related textbooks (non-mandatory reading) include: 1) The Innovators Dilemma by Clayton Christensen, Harvard Business Review Press 2) Platform Revolution by Geoffrey Park and Marshall Alstyne, W. W.

All homework deadlines are published on the course website and set since the first lecture. Homework 3 is based on a group presentation in the lectures 9 and 10. Late homework is received up to 48 hours after the deadline. A 20% penalty on the obtained grade is applied. No homework is received after 48 hours unless the delay is due to illness (contact the instructor in such cases ahead of the deadline). Homeworks 1 and 2 are to be submitted individually (i.e. each student submits their work). Homeworks 3 and 4 are to be submitted in groups of 4 or 5 students. Students will keep the same team for homeworks 3 and 4. Homeworks will be graded within a week. Pointers for answers will be uploaded on the course website before grades are given back to students. Homeworks 1 and 2 count for 15% each while Homeworks 3 and 4 will count for 25% and 30% respectively. One quiz accounting for 15% will be administered after the presentations. Other: All students are urged to follow CMU’s policies for academic integrity and plagiarism. In general, students are encouraged to discuss lecture material among themselves. For individual home assignments, students should not consult among themselves. For the assignments that require group study each team is required to submit their team answers. Course attendance: Class attendance is not mandatory but highly encouraged on a regular basis. All the homeworks will be based on material and discussions in the lectures. The presentations will need to follow the “model” in the lectures.

Late homework is received up to 48 hours after the deadline. A 20% penalty on the obtained grade is applied. No homework is received after 48 hours unless the delay is due to illness (contact the instructor in such cases ahead of the deadline). Homeworks 1 and 2 are to be submitted individually (i.e. each student submits their work). Homeworks 3 and 4 are to be submitted in groups of 4 or 5 students. Students will keep the same team for homeworks 3 and 4. Homeworks will be graded within a week. Pointers for answers will be uploaded on the course website before grades are given back to students. Homeworks 1 and 2 count for 15% each while Homeworks 3 and 4 will count for 25% and 30% respectively. One quiz accounting for 15% will be administered after the presentations. Other: All students are urged to follow CMU’s policies for academic integrity and plagiarism. In general, students are encouraged to discuss lecture material among themselves. For individual home assignments, students should not consult among themselves. For the assignments that require group study each team is required to submit their team answers. Course attendance: Class attendance is not mandatory but highly encouraged on a regular basis. All the homeworks will be based on material and discussions in the lectures. The presentations will need to follow the “model” in the lectures. Contacts: Instructor More information: https://sites.google.com/view/ananyasen/home Contact via email:  Teaching Assistants.

MALICIOUS CODE ANALYSIS
Carnegie Mellon University: Heinz College Spring 2022
Instructor: Jason Batchelor
Email: jxbatchelor@gmail.com
Office Hours: By appointment only
Website: http://www.cmu.edu/canvas/
GENERAL INFORMATION
DESCRIPTION
The ability to develop well instrumented networks, policies, and processes are directly correlated to ones
understanding of malicious code, such that it has become a requisite for any decision maker operating within a
modern enterprise. Just as necessary is the ability to effectively consume and produce actionable intelligence on
malicious code. This course aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of the various tactics,
techniques, and procedures found when analyzing malware. Students will also develop an appreciation for the
technical challenges presented by malware and how to employ strategic detections and mitigations to meet
today’s threat.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Heinz College is a unique place where policy and tech come together and there is a significant gap in industry
between those capable of reversing malicious code, and those operating in a managerial capacity to effect change
with those results. The outlined course will serve as a bridge to bring these two worlds closer together and afford a
better understanding of associated challenges.
Without an understanding of malicious code, the risk it poses to an organization, and techniques used to
undermine traditional defense measures; decision makers are ill equipped to meet threats from state sponsored
and criminal elements. By taking this course, future leaders are provided a better understanding of adversary
tradecraft and how to effectively drive their people, process, and technology to meet modern threat actors.
PREREQUISITES
There are no course prerequisites. However, students are expected to have a working knowledge of both Windows
and Linux operating systems. Students are also required to be proficient in at least one programming language.

Optional: Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig, Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting

Nearly every week there will be an individual assignment based off the lecture material for the week. Completion
of these assignments will greatly assist you on future exams and help to reinforce concepts used in the labs.
LAB EXERCISES
There will be a series of lab exercises which will be individual efforts intended to grant students more in-depth
exposure to the lecture content. Assigned labs will be less frequent but will require more effort.
PROJECT
The project will be a group assignment designed to encompass concepts from multiple lectures. Further details on
the project will be distributed later in the course.
FINAL EXAM
The final exam will consist of several multiple choice, fill in the blank, and written answer questions. No one is
excused from this exam and there will be no makeup exam. Please ensure you are present.

LATE ASSIGNMENTS
Assignments that are late will face a 50% reduction for the first 24 hours of late time. Once this time has passed
the grade cannot earn more than 20%.
The submission timestamp produced by Canvas will be the determining factor in judging if an assignment is late.
Ensure you give yourself the requisite time needed to complete each assignment as no leniency will be provided.

CLASSROOM ETIQUETTE
Students are expected to be silent and attentive during lecture. All class members must conduct themselves in a
professional and respectful manner both in and outside the classroom to promote an educational environment.
Mobile devices are expected to be silent during lecture and are only permitted for use between breaks. Please
bring any concerns to your course instructor or any CMU faculty member.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Carnegie Mellon University sets high standards for academic integrity. Those standards are supported and
enforced by students, including those who serve as academic integrity hearing panel members and hearing
officers. The presumptive sanction for a first offense is course failure, accompanied by the transcript notation
“Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.” The standard sanction for a first offense by graduate students is
suspension or expulsion. Please see http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/ for any questions.
For any assignment found to be the partial or complete result of cheating or plagiarism, your grade for that
assignment will be zero. Cheating is defined as inappropriate collaboration among students on an assignment or
failure to cite others work used in the semester paper or in-class presentation. This can include copying someone
else’s work with or without alteration. When students are found to be collaborating in this way, BOTH will pay the
penalty regardless of who originated the work.
STUDENTS WITH DISSABILITIES
Our community values diversity and seeks to promote meaningful access to educational opportunities for all
students. CMU and your instructors are committed to your success and to supporting Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). This means that in general
no individual who is otherwise qualified shall be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity, solely by reason of having a disability.
If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact us ASAP, and we will work together to
ensure that you have the correct access to resources on campus to assist you through your coursework and time at
CMU.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
During your time at Carnegie Mellon do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for
support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to
help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a

MALICIOUS CODE ANALYSIS
Carnegie Mellon University: Heinz College Spring 2022

GENERAL INFORMATION
DESCRIPTION
The ability to develop well instrumented networks, policies, and processes are directly correlated to ones
understanding of malicious code, such that it has become a requisite for any decision maker operating within a
modern enterprise. Just as necessary is the ability to effectively consume and produce actionable intelligence on
malicious code. This course aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of the various tactics,
techniques, and procedures found when analyzing malware. Students will also develop an appreciation for the
technical challenges presented by malware and how to employ strategic detections and mitigations to meet
today’s threat.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Heinz College is a unique place where policy and tech come together and there is a significant gap in industry
between those capable of reversing malicious code, and those operating in a managerial capacity to effect change
with those results. The outlined course will serve as a bridge to bring these two worlds closer together and afford a
better understanding of associated challenges.
Without an understanding of malicious code, the risk it poses to an organization, and techniques used to
undermine traditional defense measures; decision makers are ill equipped to meet threats from state sponsored
and criminal elements. By taking this course, future leaders are provided a better understanding of adversary
tradecraft and how to effectively drive their people, process, and technology to meet modern threat actors.
PREREQUISITES
There are no course prerequisites. However, students are expected to have a working knowledge of both Windows
and Linux operating systems. Students are also required to be proficient in at least one programming language.
MATERIALS
Optional: Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting
Malicious Software
Students are expected to possess or have access to a laptop for completion of course work.

ASSIGNMENTS
Nearly every week there will be an individual assignment based off the lecture material for the week. Completion
of these assignments will greatly assist you on future exams and help to reinforce concepts used in the labs.
LAB EXERCISES
There will be a series of lab exercises which will be individual efforts intended to grant students more in-depth
exposure to the lecture content. Assigned labs will be less frequent but will require more effort.
PROJECT
The project will be a group assignment designed to encompass concepts from multiple lectures. Further details on
the project will be distributed later in the course.
FINAL EXAM
The final exam will consist of several multiple choice, fill in the blank, and written answer questions. No one is
excused from this exam and there will be no makeup exam. Please ensure you are present.
POLICIES
LATE ASSIGNMENTS
Assignments that are late will face a 50% reduction for the first 24 hours of late time. Once this time has passed
the grade cannot earn more than 20%.
The submission timestamp produced by Canvas will be the determining factor in judging if an assignment is late.
Ensure you give yourself the requisite time needed to complete each assignment as no leniency will be provided.
P a g e 3 | 4
CLASSROOM ETIQUETTE
Students are expected to be silent and attentive during lecture. All class members must conduct themselves in a
professional and respectful manner both in and outside the classroom to promote an educational environment.
Mobile devices are expected to be silent during lecture and are only permitted for use between breaks. Please
bring any concerns to your course instructor or any CMU faculty member.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Carnegie Mellon University sets high standards for academic integrity. Those standards are supported and
enforced by students, including those who serve as academic integrity hearing panel members and hearing
officers. The presumptive sanction for a first offense is course failure, accompanied by the transcript notation
“Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.” The standard sanction for a first offense by graduate students is
suspension or expulsion. Please see http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/ for any questions.
For any assignment found to be the partial or complete result of cheating or plagiarism, your grade for that
assignment will be zero. Cheating is defined as inappropriate collaboration among students on an assignment or
failure to cite others work used in the semester paper or in-class presentation. This can include copying someone
else’s work with or without alteration. When students are found to be collaborating in this way, BOTH will pay the
penalty regardless of who originated the work.
STUDENTS WITH DISSABILITIES
Our community values diversity and seeks to promote meaningful access to educational opportunities for all
students. CMU and your instructors are committed to your success and to supporting Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). This means that in general
no individual who is otherwise qualified shall be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity, solely by reason of having a disability.
If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact us ASAP, and we will work together to
ensure that you have the correct access to resources on campus to assist you through your coursework and time at
CMU.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
During your time at Carnegie Mellon do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for
support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to
help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a
friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

COURSE OVERVIEW
Within any urban area, there are now countless sustainability policies and initiatives being
pursued simultaneously within the defined frameworks of individual system-wide networks
such as transportation, energy, infrastructure etc. Through utilization of geospatial analysis in
concert with resiliency metric analysis, Urban Ecologies and Technologies I will explore the
various overlapping urban systems at work within the Boston region, and analyze those
systems both as they relate to and impact each other, and as they spatially relate to and impact
adjacent communities. This course will focus on exposing such factors as (1) where are the
opportunities for synergies between the individual system resiliency frameworks (2) what are
acknowledged conflicting trajectories, and (3) where are there exemplary networks with a
potential for mutually beneficial expansion to adjacent communities. The course will begin its
analysis at the neighborhood level for an intimate understanding of urban networks as they
relate to each other, and then expand its focus to a systemwide analysis, with the objective of
developing a more unifying resiliency network understanding of the Boston urban region.
COURSE ASSIGNMENTS
Readings: Readings will be assigned / provided in class or posted to Blackboard for discussion
the following week. It is expected that all students contribute to weekly discussions on the
readings through thoughtful expansion of discussion topics and relevant inquiry.
“State of the Tech” Presentations: Mirroring the theme/topic of weekly readings, each student
will be assigned a presentation on 2-3 current projects or initiatives that exemplify the state of
the art strengths and successes of the topic for that week. These presentations will lead the
discussion segment of each week’s Tuesday class. One or two students will be assigned to each
week’s topic and the presentations will consist of a graphic presentation of between 10 and 15
minutes in length.
GIS Lab Assignments: Two data analysis and visualization projects will be assigned throughout
the course of the semester. The projects will primarily consist of GIS analysis and visualization
techniques, but students are expected to utilize other pre and post-production technologies to
aid in compiling their final graphic presentation materials (Adobe Suite, AutoCAD, etc.). The
assignments are sequential and will be progressive in nature- continuously building a more
robust and complex understanding of the resiliency of the systems at play in Boston.

SOFTWARE
While GIS and will be the primary programs for this course, additional software such as
Illustrator, Photoshop, and AutoCAD will constitute the wider arsenal of tools that you may
utilize throughout the semester.

EVALUATION
The final grade will represent the balance of attendance, verbal participation, completion of all
assignments, presentations, and the quality of work produced.
GIS LAB ASSIGNMENT 1: 30%
GIS LAB ASSIGNMENT 2: 30%
READING DISCUSSIONS/PARTICIPATION: 20%
STATE OF THE TECH PRESENTATION: 20%
Evaluation throughout the term places significant emphasis on clarity, legibility, originality, and
depth/complexity of analysis. The course grade includes a growth factor through the various
projects as well an involvement in class. SEUN 7230 does not require the submission of a paper;
it puts a strong emphasis on analysis and communication through oral presentation and graphic
means. The development of a thorough and well defined analysis coupled with superb graphics
and careful execution of presentation techniques are key to a successful project and will
influence your grade.
GRADING & ATTENDANCE
Grading is based on attendance, performance on assignments and informed participation in
class. Except in the case of emergencies late work, tardiness and absences are not acceptable
unless prior consent is given by the instructor. More than two unexcused absences will result in
reduction of the final letter grade and more than three unexcused absences will result in failure
of the course. Cell phones must be turned off or silent and internet use and communication
(texting, twitter, facebook, etc) is prohibited during lectures, presentations, and desk reviews.
In accordance with Northeastern School of Architecture’s grading policy, grades will be
distributed according to the following scale (grading policy for lecture, lab and studio courses
is available on http:// www.architecture.neu.edu/student_resources/grading_policy)
ACADEMIC HONESTY
Northeastern University and the School of Architecture are committed to the principles of
intellectual honesty and integrity. Members of the Northeastern community are expected to
maintain complete honesty in all academic work, presenting only that which is their own work
in tests and assignments. Should you have any questions regarding proper attribution of the
work of others, contact your professor prior to submitting work for evaluation, or refer to the
university policies on the subject (http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academicintegrity/).
STUDENT FEEDBACK
The College of Art, Media and Design considers student feedback essential and requires all
students to complete TRACE evaluations at the end of the semester. You will be asked to
provide a screen shot to your instructor that reflects your participation. Note that you can,
anonymously, opt out of completing the survey and still obtain the screen shot that satisfies the
TRACE requirement.

ADDITIONAL DESIGN SOFTWARE
ARCGIS
A one year free subscription is available to Northeastern students. Information for
obtaining the subscription will be provided on the first day of the course. Online tutorials
are also available through Esri, and are available at the following website:
http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=catalog.webCourseDetail&courseid=194

The first three tutorials are free. If students are interested in completing additional
tutorials, a free login id can be generated by the University upon request.
ADOBE CREATIVE CLOUD (ILLUSTRATOR, PHOTOSHOP, AFTER EFFECTS)
Is cheap for students and available here
http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/students.edu.html
Adobe Creative Cloud is a service from Adobe Systems that gives users access to the
company’s suites of software for graphic design, video editing, and web development
applications and cloud services. It works on a software as a service model where the
consumers don’t own the software but are merely renting it for the duration of the
subscription. When the subscription ends and isn’t renewed, the user loses access to the
applications as well as some work saved in proprietary formats that can’t be used with
competing applications. Internet connection is required for upgrading and using online
features.
RHINOCEROS (RHINO)
Is free for Mac computers and available here http://mac.rhino3d.com
Rhinoceros 3d gained its popularity in architectural design in part because of the many
new avant-garde designers using parametric modeling tools Rhino’s increasing
popularity is based on its diversity, multi-disciplinary functions, low learning-curve,
relatively low cost, and its ability to import and export over 30 file formats, which allows
Rhino to act as a ‘converter’ tool between programs in a design workflow. Rhino
specializes in free-form non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) modeling. Plug-ins
developed by McNeel include Flamingo (raytrace rendering), Penguin (nonphotorealistic rendering), Bongo, and Brazil (advanced rendering). There are also
rendering plug-ins for Maxwell Render, V-ray, Thea and many other engines. Rhino is a
stand-alone, commercial NURBS-based 3-D modeling software, developed by Robert
McNeel & Associates.
When opening CAD file formats not in Rhino native file format, the program will always
create a new drawing called “Untitled” and convert the file, meaning that for the file to
remain in its old file format it must be re-converted to its original format. Images cannot
be opened directly: they can be inserted as a background bitmap (for sketching), as a
wallpaper or used as texture in an object material.
As the AutoDesk AutoCAD’s file format changes every new version released (see DWG
file format for more information), the Open Design Alliance has to reverse engineer the 
10
file format once more. So programs like Rhino3D can’t always open AutoCAD files written
in the most recent versions.
Rhino3D current version (Rhino3D 4.0 SR9) opens only DWG/DXF file formats until 2007
version. DWG files from 2008 to 2012 can opened only after being converted to older
DWG versions using an appropriate version of Autodesk AutoCAD or the free Autodesk
DWG TrueView 2012.
AUTOCAD STUDENT VERSION
Is free for students and available here
http://students.autodesk.com/?nd=download_center
AutoCAD is licensed at a significant discount over commercial retail pricing to qualifying
students and teachers, with a 36-month license available. The student version of
AutoCAD is functionally identical to the full commercial version, with one exception:
DWG files created or edited by a student version have an internal bit-flag set (the
“educational flag”). When such a DWG file is printed by any version of AutoCAD
(commercial or student), the output includes a plot stamp / banner on all four sides.",,"Urban Ecologies & Technologies I

 INSTRUCTOR, COURSE OVERVIEW
 Within any urban area, there are now countless sustainability policies and initiatives being
 pursued simultaneously within the defined frameworks of individual system-wide networks
 such as transportation, energy, infrastructure etc. Through utilization of geospatial analysis in
 concert with resiliency metric analysis, Urban Ecologies and Technologies I will explore the
 various overlapping urban systems at work within the Boston region, and analyze those
 systems both as they relate to and impact each other, and as they spatially relate to and impact
 adjacent communities. This course will focus on exposing such factors as (1) where are the
 opportunities for synergies between the individual system resiliency frameworks (2) what are
 acknowledged conflicting trajectories, and (3) where are there exemplary networks with a
 potential for mutually beneficial expansion to adjacent communities. The course will begin its
 analysis at the neighborhood level for an intimate understanding of urban networks as they
 relate to each other, and then expand its focus to a systemwide analysis, with the objective of
 developing a more unifying resiliency network understanding of the Boston urban region.
 COURSE ASSIGNMENTS
 Readings: Readings will be assigned / provided in class or posted to Blackboard for discussion
 the following week. It is expected that all students contribute to weekly discussions on the
 readings through thoughtful expansion of discussion topics and relevant inquiry.
 “State of the Tech” Presentations: Mirroring the theme/topic of weekly readings, each student
 will be assigned a presentation on 2-3 current projects or initiatives that exemplify the state of
 the art strengths and successes of the topic for that week. These presentations will lead the
 discussion segment of each week’s Tuesday class. One or two students will be assigned to each
 week’s topic and the presentations will consist of a graphic presentation of between 10 and 15
 minutes in length.
 GIS Lab Assignments: Two data analysis and visualization projects will be assigned throughout
 the course of the semester. The projects will primarily consist of GIS analysis and visualization
 techniques, but students are expected to utilize other pre and post-production technologies to
 aid in compiling their final graphic presentation materials (Adobe Suite, AutoCAD, etc.). The
 assignments are sequential and will be progressive in nature- continuously building a more
 robust and complex understanding of the resiliency of the systems at play in Boston.

 SOFTWARE
 While GIS and will be the primary programs for this course, additional software such as
 Illustrator, Photoshop, and AutoCAD will constitute the wider arsenal of tools that you may

 EVALUATION
 The final grade will represent the balance of attendance, verbal participation, completion of all
 assignments, presentations, and the quality of work produced.
 GIS LAB ASSIGNMENT 1: 30%
 GIS LAB ASSIGNMENT 2: 30%
 READING DISCUSSIONS/PARTICIPATION: 20%
 STATE OF THE TECH PRESENTATION: 20%
 Evaluation throughout the term places significant emphasis on clarity, legibility, originality, and
 depth/complexity of analysis. The course grade includes a growth factor through the various
 projects as well an involvement in class. SEUN 7230 does not require the submission of a paper;
 it puts a strong emphasis on analysis and communication through oral presentation and graphic
 means. The development of a thorough and well defined analysis coupled with superb graphics
 and careful execution of presentation techniques are key to a successful project and will
 influence your grade.
 GRADING & ATTENDANCE
 Grading is based on attendance, performance on assignments and informed participation in
 class. Except in the case of emergencies late work, tardiness and absences are not acceptable
 unless prior consent is given by the instructor. More than two unexcused absences will result in
 reduction of the final letter grade and more than three unexcused absences will result in failure
 of the course. Cell phones must be turned off or silent and internet use and communication
 (texting, twitter, facebook, etc) is prohibited during lectures, presentations, and desk reviews.
 In accordance with Northeastern School of Architecture’s grading policy, grades will be
 distributed according to the following scale (grading policy for lecture, lab and studio courses
 is available on http:// www.architecture.neu.edu/student_resources/grading_policy)
 ACADEMIC HONESTY
 Northeastern University and the School of Architecture are committed to the principles of
 intellectual honesty and integrity. Members of the Northeastern community are expected to
 maintain complete honesty in all academic work, presenting only that which is their own work
 in tests and assignments. Should you have any questions regarding proper attribution of the
 work of others, contact your professor prior to submitting work for evaluation, or refer to the
 university policies on the subject (http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academicintegrity/).
 STUDENT FEEDBACK
 The College of Art, Media and Design considers student feedback essential and requires all
 students to complete TRACE evaluations at the end of the semester. You will be asked to
 provide a screen shot to your instructor that reflects your participation. Note that you can,
 anonymously, opt out of completing the survey and still obtain the screen shot that satisfies the
 TRACE requirement.

 ADDITIONAL DESIGN SOFTWARE
 ARCGIS
 A one year free subscription is available to Northeastern students. Information for
 obtaining the subscription will be provided on the first day of the course. Online tutorials
 are also available through Esri, and are available at the following website:
 http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=catalog.webCourseDetail&courseid=194

 The first three tutorials are free. If students are interested in completing additional
 tutorials, a free login id can be generated by the University upon request.
 ADOBE CREATIVE CLOUD (ILLUSTRATOR, PHOTOSHOP, AFTER EFFECTS)
 Is cheap for students and available here
 http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/students.edu.html
 Adobe Creative Cloud is a service from Adobe Systems that gives users access to the
 company’s suites of software for graphic design, video editing, and web development
 applications and cloud services. It works on a software as a service model where the
 consumers don’t own the software but are merely renting it for the duration of the
 subscription. When the subscription ends and isn’t renewed, the user loses access to the
 applications as well as some work saved in proprietary formats that can’t be used with
 competing applications. Internet connection is required for upgrading and using online
 features.
 RHINOCEROS (RHINO)
 Is free for Mac computers and available here http://mac.rhino3d.com
 Rhinoceros 3d gained its popularity in architectural design in part because of the many
 new avant-garde designers using parametric modeling tools Rhino’s increasing
 popularity is based on its diversity, multi-disciplinary functions, low learning-curve,
 relatively low cost, and its ability to import and export over 30 file formats, which allows
 Rhino to act as a ‘converter’ tool between programs in a design workflow. Rhino
 specializes in free-form non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) modeling. Plug-ins
 developed by McNeel include Flamingo (raytrace rendering), Penguin (nonphotorealistic rendering), Bongo, and Brazil (advanced rendering). There are also
 rendering plug-ins for Maxwell Render, V-ray, Thea and many other engines. Rhino is a
 stand-alone, commercial NURBS-based 3-D modeling software, developed by Robert
 McNeel & Associates.
 When opening CAD file formats not in Rhino native file format, the program will always
 create a new drawing called “Untitled” and convert the file, meaning that for the file to
 remain in its old file format it must be re-converted to its original format. Images cannot
 be opened directly: they can be inserted as a background bitmap (for sketching), as a
 wallpaper or used as texture in an object material.
 As the AutoDesk AutoCAD’s file format changes every new version released (see DWG
 file format for more information), the Open Design Alliance has to reverse engineer the 
 10
 file format once more. So programs like Rhino3D can’t always open AutoCAD files written
 in the most recent versions.
 Rhino3D current version (Rhino3D 4.0 SR9) opens only DWG/DXF file formats until 2007
 version. DWG files from 2008 to 2012 can opened only after being converted to older
 DWG versions using an appropriate version of Autodesk AutoCAD or the free Autodesk
 DWG TrueView 2012.
 AUTOCAD STUDENT VERSION
 Is free for students and available here
 http://students.autodesk.com/?nd=download_center
 AutoCAD is licensed at a significant discount over commercial retail pricing to qualifying
 students and teachers, with a 36-month license available. The student version of
 AutoCAD is functionally identical to the full commercial version, with one exception:
 DWG files created or edited by a student version have an internal bit-flag set (the
 “educational flag”). When such a DWG file is printed by any version of AutoCAD
 (commercial or student), the output includes a plot stamp / banner on all four sides.","['urban', 'ecology', 'technology', 'urban', 'ecological', 'changevulnerability', 'resilience', 'suen', 'urban',

MIT,"Transportation Policy, Strategy, and Management",https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/1-223j-transportation-policy-strategy-and-management-fall-2004/pages/syllabus/,Found,"Course Meeting Times
Lectures: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Objective
Transportation Policy, Strategy and Management is a survey course of current concepts, theory and issues in the strategic management of transportation organizations. Designed for graduate transportation, logistics, planning and engineering systems students, the objective of this course is to provide students with an overview of the operating context, leadership challenges, strategies and management tools that are used in today’s public and private transportation organizations. As transportation operations occur within an environment where the roles of public and private organizations are often blurred, this course focuses on the patterns of conflict and consensus between government and industry in transportation. The following concepts, approaches and issues are presented: alternative models of decision making, strategic planning (e.g., use of SWOT analysis and scenario development), stakeholder valuation and analysis, government-business regulation and cooperation within the transportation enterprise, disaster communications, change management and the impact of globalization.

Course Requirements
Each class meeting will be a combination of lectures and group discussions. Lectures will integrate the assigned readings and other materials. Group discussion will examine a particular case, apply the concepts contained within the readings and integrate the lecture materials.

Students are expected to attend all classes and meaningfully contribute to group discussions. Readings are to be completed for the day they are listed. Students are responsible for being able to discuss specific policy problems in the context of the readings. Attendance and the quality of class participation will account for 10 percent of the final grade and will be considered in borderline grade cases.

Written work includes two 15-page papers. The first paper will provide policy analysis to a senior transportation official in government regarding a specific policy problem. The second paper will advise an executive in a private firm about a problem that could have global implications for their business. Assignments will be given in class. Each paper will be 45 percent of the final grade. Grading criteria includes demonstrating an understanding of the case material, integration and application of lecture and reading concepts, and the quality of written presentation.",,"Course Meeting Times
