Harvard University,The Arts and Learning,https://syllabus.harvard.edu/search/courses/?c=f8828963632e4b33028d30ec41c8237f&q=Art,Found,"S-301 The Arts and Learning Spring, 2020 Fridays from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Room: Larsen 203 and 214 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1weChzNoZqRm7tw3PQstDLoxE6ZBh-5Btzip6MsQwh2Q/edit? usp=sharing Teaching Fellows: Allegra Fletcher afletcher@gse.harvard.edu Office hours: By appointment Cora Higgins cah845@mail.harvard.edu Office hours: By appointment Course Description: This course is an inquiry into the nature of learning in and through the arts. It focuses on what happens in the interactions between students, teachers, works of art, and artistic processes in formal and informal spaces of arts learning. Issues related to learning theory, curriculum design, assessment, student-teacher relationships, and the ways in which artistic processes function as learning processes will be explored. At the heart of the course, though, are questions about the purposes of the arts in education and the nature of quality in arts learning experiences. In considering various purposes, we will investigate differences between teaching in the arts (teaching specific artistic practices) and teaching through the arts (the use of the arts to enrich the study of non-arts subject matter). We explore these topics through the study of readings, sharing stories of practice, dialogue with each other and with guest artists and educators, and through the practice of a series of reflective and analytic exercises. Learning and practicing these exercises will comprise a major portion of the course work. In some ways, S301 builds on S300 and AIE students are welcome and encouraged to take both, but they are designed to stand independently from each other. In both terms, we consider aspects of a series of core questions (below). In S301, we focus on these questions in relation to the ways in which teaching and learning happen in a wide range of settings. The questions are: 1) Identityâ€”How do I identify in this work? And in the world? 2) Purposesâ€”Why do I do what I do? 3) Valuesâ€”Why do I do what I do in the way I do it? What do I value and what does it mean to live and work in alignment with my values? 4) Responsibilityâ€” To whom and what am I responsible in my work and in the world? How do I understand my responsibility for imagining â€œthings as if they could be otherwise,â€​ as Maxine Greene wrote, and for working to achieve what I imagine? What are the particular contributions that artists,     educators, and artist/educators can make to address issues and conditions they believe need to be addressed? 5) Learningâ€”What does it mean to really learn something and what does it mean to teach? S301 is open to all HGSE Masterâ€TMs and Doctoral students. Students from other schools are welcome to apply to the instructor for permission to enroll in S301. Class sessions are videotaped for posting on the course website. These videos are accessible to all members of the S300 community, notably to provide documentation of class for those who have to miss a class session. Anyone missing class for any reason is expected to watch the posted videos from that session and discuss what happened during the session with several students and a Teaching Fellow or the course instructor. *** The Structure of this Course: Class Sessions Class meets on Fridays from 9:00 to noon. Each class session will include a check-in or warm-up, discussion of required readings, activities related to the focus of the week, work on our â€ ̃exercisesâ€TM, and a period for reflection on our â€ ̃learning stories.â€TM Readings There are required readings and/or videos each week and some weeks there are suggested readings as well. (Suggested readings may be referenced in class discussions, but students will not be held responsible for being prepared to discuss them. That said, please do the suggested readings whenever possible.) Required readings can be found on the S301 course website in Canvas. Weekly assignments are posted each Friday on the S301 course website and may reflect changes in the syllabus. It is important to check the S301 course website and not simply rely on the syllabus. Exercises Just as there are exercises designed for pianists to develop and maintain their technical abilities, I believe there are exercises that artist/educators can learn and do throughout their careers. These exercises, however, are more reflective, analytic, interpretive, and philosophical than strictly technical. In each class session, we will introduce new exercises and/or discuss your experiences doing them, though the exercises themselves will be done outside of class. Sections All students are required to participate in a weekly, one-hour section meeting led by a member of the Teaching Team. Course Requirements: Each student will be expected to: 1. Be present at all class sessions and participate in all class activities and discussions*; 2. Keep up with all assigned course readings (assignments posted weekly); 3. Be present at and participate in weekly section meetings; 4. Complete all assigned work on time; 5. Make all reasonable efforts to support the work and learning of your classmates; 6. Respect and adhere to guidelines for participation in class, as established by the Teaching Team and the class during the term. Assessment of Student Performance: Students will be evaluated on the basis of: 1. Dedication to inquiry and exploration in all aspects of class work; 2. Organization and care in preparation for class; 3. Familiarity with and thoughtfulness about issues and readings as reflected through participation in class and section; 4. Depth and rigor of thought, structure, and attention to detail in the exercises;       5. Willingness and ability to learn with and from others in the class. SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY is the default assessment given for this course. * In the event that a student is ill or needs to miss a class session for any other reason, it is the studentâ€TMs responsibility to inform the Teaching Team prior to the anticipated absence. In the event of sudden illness, the student should send word to the Teaching Team as soon as possible. Multiple absences will compromise the learning experience and can lead to an Incomplete/Unsatisfactory grade. HGSE Policy on Plagiarism from the HGSE Student Handbook: All work submitted to meet course requirements is expected to be the studentâ€TMs own. In the preparation of all papers and other written work submitted to meet course requirements and dissertations, a student must be careful to distinguish between ideas that are his or her own and those that have been derived from other sources. Information and opinions drawn from all sources are to be attributed specifically to these sources. It is the studentâ€TMs responsibility to learn and use the proper forms of citation. Quotations must be properly placed within quotation marks and must be fully cited. All paraphrased material must also be fully cited. In all cases where ideas or material presented are derived from a studentâ€TMs reading and research, the source used must be indicated. Students who submit work either not their own or without clear attribution to the original source, for whatever reason, face sanctions up to and including dismissal and expulsion. HGSE Policy on Assistance in Course Work and Writing: Students occasionally work with others or receive assistance in various aspects of their course work. Students should be very clear about how they are working with others and what types of assistance, if any, they are receiving. Students should disclose to their professors any plans for outside professional assistance on editing, statistical work, or other matters central to completing their work. The student's professor will approve those kinds and levels of assistance that support, rather than supplant, the student's research, writing and learning. If assistance was approved, the student must specify what sort of assistance they received and from whom on the paper in question, upon submission. The goal of this oversight is to preserve the status of the work as the student's own genuine intellectual product. Students should remember that the Gutman Library Academic Writing Services (AWS) is available to assist them with assessing and editing their own work. AWS assistance has been sanctioned by HGSE. PLEASE NOTE: S301 has been structured to acknowledge both the practical and intellectual values of collaboration. To this end, it may be difficult to sort out, identify and â€œpreserve the status of the work as the student's own genuine intellectual productâ€​ in all situations. Nonetheless, students are expected to acknowledge the contributions of their peers as thoroughly as possible in the text of any papers, in footnotes, or in explanatory notes at the start of a paper. Assignments Required Readings All required readings will be available either in pdf form on the course website or online (available through URL links or posted on the course website). â€œRecommendedâ€​ readings may sometimes also be found on the course website or on reserve at the circulation desk of Gutman Library. Exercises There will be seven exercises assigned during the termâ€”one every other week. Five are my design; two will be of your design. They are: 1. Talking With Artists Who Teach--DUE: Friday, February 14 2. Making Implicit Learning Theories Explicitâ€”DUE: Friday, February 28 3. Images & Identities of Artists/Educatorsâ€”DUE: Friday, March 13 4. Self Care With/Through Artâ€”DUE: Friday, March 27 5. Create Your Own Exercise--DUE: Friday, April 10 6. Each One, Teach One--DUE: Friday, April 24 7. Final Syllabi--DUE: Monday, May 4 These exercises take a variety of forms and invite the use of diverse materials, including but not limited to words on paper. All will have artifacts that can be brought to class. In the case of large-form sculptural work, performances, or other materials that canâ€TMt be brought to class due to space and/or time issues, you are responsible for documentation of that work that can be shared in whole or in part. You must also    keep the productsâ€”or documentation of the productsâ€”of your exercises throughout the term. We provide GoogleDoc folders for this purpose.

It focuses on what happens in the interactions between students, teachers, works of art, and artistic processes in formal and informal spaces of arts learning. Issues related to learning theory, curriculum design, assessment, student-teacher relationships, and the ways in which artistic processes function as learning processes will be explored. At the heart of the course, though, are questions about the purposes of the arts in education and the nature of quality in arts learning experiences. In considering various purposes, we will investigate differences between teaching in the arts (teaching specific artistic practices) and teaching through the arts (the use of the arts to enrich the study of non-arts subject matter). We explore these topics through the study of readings, sharing stories of practice, dialogue with each other and with guest artists and educators, and through the practice of a series of reflective and analytic exercises. Learning and practicing these exercises will comprise a major portion of the course work. In some ways, S301 builds on S300 and AIE students are welcome and encouraged to take both, but they are designed to stand independently from each other. In both terms, we consider aspects of a series of core questions (below). In S301, we focus on these questions in relation to the ways in which teaching and learning happen in a wide range of settings. The questions are: 1) Identityâ€”How do I identify in this work? And in the world? 2) Purposesâ€”Why do I do what I do? 3) Valuesâ€”Why do I do what I do in the way I do it? What do I value and what does it mean to live and work in alignment with my values? 4) Responsibilityâ€” To whom and what am I responsible in my work and in the world? How do I understand my responsibility for imagining â€œthings as if they could be otherwise,â€​ as wrote, and for working to achieve what I imagine? What are the particular contributions that artists, educators, and artist/educators can make to address issues and conditions they believe need to be addressed? 5) Learningâ€”What does it mean to really learn something and what does it mean to teach? S301 is open to all HGSE Masterâ€TMs and Doctoral students. Students from other schools are welcome to apply to the instructor for permission to enroll in S301. Class sessions are videotaped for posting on the course website. These videos are accessible to all members of the S300 community, notably to provide documentation of class for those who have to miss a class session. Anyone missing class for any reason is expected to watch the posted videos from that session and discuss what happened during the session with several students and a Teaching Fellow or the course instructor. *** The Structure of this Course: Class Sessions Class meets on Fridays from 9:00 to noon. Each class session will include a check-in or warm-up, discussion of required readings, activities related to the focus of the week, work on our â€ ̃exercisesâ€TM, and a period for reflection on our â€ ̃learning stories.â€TM Readings There are required readings and/or videos each week and some weeks there are suggested readings as well. (Suggested readings may be referenced in class discussions, but students will not be held responsible for being prepared to discuss them. That said, please do the suggested readings whenever possible.) Required readings can be found on the S301 course website in Canvas. Weekly assignments are posted each Friday on the S301 course website and may reflect changes in the syllabus. It is important to check the S301 course website and not simply rely on the syllabus. Exercises Just as there are exercises designed for pianists to develop and maintain their technical abilities, I believe there are exercises that artist/educators can learn and do throughout their careers. These exercises, however, are more reflective, analytic, interpretive, and philosophical than strictly technical. In each class session, we will introduce new exercises and/or discuss your experiences doing them, though the exercises themselves will be done outside of class. Sections All students are required to participate in a weekly, one-hour section meeting led by a member of the Teaching Team. Course Requirements: Each student will be expected to: 1. Be present at all class sessions and participate in all class activities and discussions*; 2. Keep up with all assigned course readings (assignments posted weekly); 3. Be present at and participate in weekly section meetings; 4. Complete all assigned work on time; 5. Make all reasonable efforts to support the work and learning of your classmates; 6. Respect and adhere to guidelines for participation in class, as established by the Teaching Team and the class during the term. Assessment of Student Performance: Students will be evaluated on the basis of: 1. Dedication to inquiry and exploration in all aspects of class work; 2. Organization and care in preparation for class; 3. Familiarity with and thoughtfulness about issues and readings as reflected through participation in class and section; 4. Depth and rigor of thought, structure, and attention to detail in the exercises; 5. Willingness and ability to learn with and from others in the class. SATISFACTORY UNSATISFACTORY is the default assessment given for this course. * In the event that a student is ill or needs to miss a class session for any other reason, it is the studentâ€TMs responsibility to inform the Teaching Team prior to the anticipated absence. In the event of sudden illness, the student should send word to the Teaching Team as soon as possible. Multiple absences will compromise the learning experience and can lead to an Incomplete/Unsatisfactory grade. HGSE Policy on Plagiarism from the HGSE Student Handbook: All work submitted to meet course requirements is expected to be the studentâ€TMs own. In the preparation of all papers and other written work submitted to meet course requirements and dissertations, a student must be careful to distinguish between ideas that are his or her own and those that have been derived from other sources. Information and opinions drawn from all sources are to be attributed specifically to these sources. It is the studentâ€TMs responsibility to learn and use the proper forms of citation. Quotations must be properly placed within quotation marks and must be fully cited. All paraphrased material must also be fully cited. In all cases where ideas or material presented are derived from a studentâ€TMs reading and research, the source used must be indicated. Students who submit work either not their own or without clear attribution to the original source, for whatever reason, face sanctions up to and including dismissal and expulsion. HGSE Policy on Assistance in Course Work and Writing: Students occasionally work with others or receive assistance in various aspects of their course work. Students should be very clear about how they are working with others and what types of assistance, if any, they are receiving. Students should disclose to their professors any plans for outside professional assistance on editing, statistical work, or other matters central to completing their work. The student's professor will approve those kinds and levels of assistance that support, rather than supplant, the student's research, writing and learning. If assistance was approved, the student must specify what sort of assistance they received and from whom on the paper in question, upon submission. The goal of this oversight is to preserve the status of the work as the student's own genuine intellectual product. Students should remember that the Gutman Library Academic Writing Services (AWS) is available to assist them with assessing and editing their own work. AWS assistance has been sanctioned by HGSE. PLEASE NOTE: S301 has been structured to acknowledge both the practical and intellectual values of collaboration. To this end, it may be difficult to sort out, identify and â€œpreserve the status of the work as the student's own genuine intellectual productâ€​ in all situations. Nonetheless, students are expected to acknowledge the contributions of their peers as thoroughly as possible in the text of any papers, in footnotes, or in explanatory notes at the start of a paper. Assignments Required Readings All required readings will be available either in pdf form on the course website or online (available through URL links or posted on the course website). â€œRecommendedâ€​ readings may sometimes also be found on the course website or on reserve at the circulation desk of Gutman Library.

Rather than creating the illusion of space, these modern grammars of form tend to stress duality and contradiction. This course will introduce students to the history of modern Western art from the late 19th century to the present, by considering a sequence of procedures or methods of producing art. This lexicon of modernism will be organized in a roughly chronological sequence, but also ordered according to three themes: ""Grammars of the Human,"" which will investigate how modern geopolitics, in its simultaneous introduction of democracy and colonialism, revised what counts as a person; ""Grammars of Industry,"" which will explore how industrial production served as a model for artmaking; and ""Grammars of Information,"" which considers how the rise of the information era, in which virtually everything may be translated into data, has effected modern art. Each of these procedures is defined below in the syllabus and will be elaborated in lectures supplemented by readings. Together they will establish the elements of a language of modern art that is still in use today. Sections will stress direct encounter and analysis of art in Harvard's museum collections. The course is designed as an introduction and requires no previous acquaintance with modern or contemporary art. Course Policies and Expectations: It is expected that students attend all lectures and sections. Absences must be explained through a doctor's note or communication from a residential dean. Readings and Access: Required Text: Hal Foster et. al, American Art Since 1900, third edition vols 1 & 2 (London: Thames & Hudson, 2016); special link to the Harvard Coop here All readings, including the required text, are on reserve at the Fine Arts Library. All essays (excluding the required text) are also posted on the course Canvas site in pdf format in the ""files"" section. Assignments and Grading Procedures: Midterm Examination: The exam, on October 18th, will consist of essay questions covering assigned readings and works of art that have been discussed in the course. (30% of grade). Term Paper: A 7- to 10-page paper will be due during reading period. Students will be asked to reflect on one of the ""keywords"" covered since the midterm examination in light of works of art you have seen in person in Harvard or Boston museums (or in collections elsewhere if you are able to travel during the term). Topics must be approved in conversation with the instructor or TF, no later than November 17. (50% of grade). Participation: Students are expected to attend lectures and sections and to participate in discussion. (20 % of grade). Late Assignments: You must receive permission for an extension from the instructor before the due date. Otherwise, you will lose one-third of a letter grade for each day past the deadline. No extensions will be granted after the due date has passed.          Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term, 2/4/22. Failure to do so may result in the Course Head's inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although Faculty are invited to contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation. ***** GRAMMARS OF THE HUMAN 9/1: The Impression: A painterly mark that seeks to simultaneously register the temperament of an artist (their subjectivity) and an objective optical truth.

If there are more than 15 applicants, we will endeavor to create a balanced class while prioritizing students with concentrations in AFVS or FVS, seniors and juniors with a secondary field in AFVS, and those working on theses or dissertations related to politics and cinema."" Overview This seminar surveys the landscape of global political cinema from the explosive 1960s to the unsettled present. Our central aims are to explore the relationship between cinema and politics, and to expand our understanding of the ways in which cinema can be political. Some questions we will ask: How can a film be political? Where do a filmâ€TMs politics reside? What does it mean to make films politically, and to read films politically? We will consider the connection between politics and form, the possibilities of cinema as politics, and cinemaâ€TMs representation of politics as well as cinemaâ€TMs politics of representation. We will trace a partial history of committed cinema and explore the role of film in revolutionary culture. The emancipatory movements of the 1960s and 1970s inevitably dominate such histories, and they occupy much of our attention in this class. But we will not treat the cinemas of resistance of yesteryear solely as a historical phenomenon; we will also ask how these works resonate today, in a very different political and cultural context, and how they might help us frame our present understanding of politics and cinema. Instead of adhering to a strict chronological or geographic progression, the class is structured in a way that allows us to bridge space and time â€” we will study classics of militant cinema alongside a diverse       array of recent and contemporary approaches to making political films. Viewing and reading Films will be screened every Tuesday in the Carpenter Center Lecture Hall as well as assigned to you to watch in your own time. Films assigned for home viewing will be made available as links or files on a shared drive, or can be found on various streaming sites (Criterion Channel, Ovid.TV, YouTube, iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, Kanopy). You are encouraged to take notes while watching films (or immediately after) â€” these will be useful for discussions and for your contributions to the class blog. Readings will be posted on the course site. Essays assigned for a given week should be read before that weekâ€TMs discussion. Screenings and readings, especially in later weeks, are subject to change, as we will likely adapt our viewing and reading lists based on the interests of the class. Please be aware that some of the films we will watch in this class may involve varying degrees of discomfort on the part of the viewer. This discomfort, which may be the result of violent or otherwise disturbing content or challenging formal strategy, is integral to the experience of political cinema and has the potential to act as a catalyst for productive and thoughtful discussion. Enrolling in this seminar brings with it the expectation that you are willing to engage with such material. If you have any questions about this, please write to either Dennis or Julia. Assignments and guidelines Discussion groups and class presentations: In addition to the weekly seminar, students will participate in smaller, rotating discussion groups to which you will be assigned. You may meet in person or on Zoom â€” try to set aside at least 45 minutes for each meeting. Each group will collectively submit at least three discussion questions ahead of the Monday class (due by Sunday 6 pm ET); you may also select a passage from an assigned film or text to present to the bigger group for closer analysis. Class blog: Write eight one-page (approx 400-5oo words) posts for the Canvas class blog. These can be responses to films on our viewing list (individual films, or pairings or groups thereof), or to othersâ€TM posts. Think of these short papers as opportunities to flesh out your reactions to various films; your analyses should be integrated with ideas drawn from class discussions, assigned readings, or your own research. This is an exercise you should be engaged in throughout the semester. The first four responses are due by October 25 and the rest by December 3. A written one-page proposal for your final project is due November 5. The project itself is due December 8. The final project can take one of the following forms: a written paper (10-12 pages) on a film, filmmaker, or theme of your choice, with some relevance to political cinema a written curatorial program, including a title, introductory essay (3-4 pages), and film notes (1 page each), for a themed screening series on some aspect of political cinema, consisting of at least 8 and no more than 12 films. The majority of your program should consist of films that were not discussed in class. a short film, video essay, or multimedia piece with some relevance to political cinema The success of any seminar depends on active and thoughtful participation from each member of the class. Please be prepared to discuss and engage with all assigned films and readings. We will be joined occasionally by guest filmmakers, scholars, or critics for brief discussions about their work. Grades: seminar attendance and participation (30%), discussion group assignments and class presentations (10%), class blog (25%), final project proposal (5%), final project (30%). Grace period and attendance: A total grace period of three days is allotted to each student for the semester. Late submissions beyond the grace period will affect your grade, as will more than one unexcused absence. Academic Integrity: Students are expected to adhere to Harvardâ€TMs Academic Integrity policies. Outside    of the small-group presentations, all work for this class, including the viewing log entries and final project, are to be completed independently. Please adhere to standard citation practices for all written work. Accommodations for Students With Disabilities: Harvard provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities. Please notify the professor as soon as possible if you expect to be receiving accommodations.

Overview This seminar surveys the landscape of global political cinema from the explosive 1960s to the unsettled present. Our central aims are to explore the relationship between cinema and politics, and to expand our understanding of the ways in which cinema can be political. Some questions we will ask: How can a film be political? Where do a filmâ€TMs politics reside? What does it mean to make films politically, and to read films politically? We will consider the connection between politics and form, the possibilities of cinema as politics, and cinemaâ€TMs representation of politics as well as cinemaâ€TMs politics of representation. We will trace a partial history of committed cinema and explore the role of film in revolutionary culture. The emancipatory movements of the 1960s and 1970s inevitably dominate such histories, and they occupy much of our attention in this class. But we will not treat the cinemas of resistance of yesteryear solely as a historical phenomenon; we will also ask how these works resonate today, in a very different political and cultural context, and how they might help us frame our present understanding of politics and cinema. Instead of adhering to a strict chronological or geographic progression, the class is structured in a way that allows us to bridge space and time â€” we will study classics of militant cinema alongside a diverse array of recent and contemporary approaches to making political films. Viewing and reading Films will be screened every Tuesday in the Carpenter Center Lecture Hall as well as assigned to you to watch in your own time. Films assigned for home viewing will be made available as links or files on a shared drive, or can be found on various streaming sites (Criterion Channel, Ovid.TV, YouTube, iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, Kanopy). You are encouraged to take notes while watching films (or immediately after) â€” these will be useful for discussions and for your contributions to the class blog. Readings will be posted on the course site. Essays assigned for a given week should be read before that weekâ€TMs discussion. Screenings and readings, especially in later weeks, are subject to change, as we will likely adapt our viewing and reading lists based on the interests of the class. Please be aware that some of the films we will watch in this class may involve varying degrees of discomfort on the part of the viewer. This discomfort, which may be the result of violent or otherwise disturbing content or challenging formal strategy, is integral to the experience of political cinema and has the potential to act as a catalyst for productive and thoughtful discussion. Enrolling in this seminar brings with it the expectation that you are willing to engage with such material. If you have any questions about this, please write to either. Assignments and guidelines Discussion groups and class presentations: In addition to the weekly seminar, students will participate in smaller, rotating discussion groups to which you will be assigned. You may meet in person or on Zoom â€” try to set aside at least 45 minutes for each meeting. Each group will collectively submit at least three discussion questions ahead of the Monday class (due by Sunday 6 pm ET); you may also select a passage from an assigned film or text to present to the bigger group for closer analysis. Class blog: Write eight one-page (approx 400-5oo words) posts for the Canvas class blog. These can be responses to films on our viewing list (individual films, or pairings or groups thereof), or to othersâ€TM posts. Think of these short papers as opportunities to flesh out your reactions to various films; your analyses should be integrated with ideas drawn from class discussions, assigned readings, or your own research. This is an exercise you should be engaged in throughout the semester. The first four responses are due by October 25 and the rest by December 3. A written one-page proposal for your final project is due November 5. The project itself is due December 8. The final project can take one of the following forms: a written paper (10-12 pages) on a film, filmmaker, or theme of your choice, with some relevance to political cinema a written curatorial program, including a title, introductory essay (3-4 pages), and film notes (1 page each), for a themed screening series on some aspect of political cinema, consisting of at least 8 and no more than 12 films. The majority of your program should consist of films that were not discussed in class. a short film, video essay, or multimedia piece with some relevance to political cinema The success of any seminar depends on active and thoughtful participation from each member of the class. Please be prepared to discuss and engage with all assigned films and readings. We will be joined occasionally by guest filmmakers, scholars, or critics for brief discussions about their work. Grades: seminar attendance and participation (30%), discussion group assignments and class presentations (10%), class blog (25%), final project proposal (5%), final project (30%). Grace period and attendance: A total grace period of three days is allotted to each student for the semester. Late submissions beyond the grace period will affect your grade, as will more than one unexcused absence. Academic Integrity: Students are expected to adhere to Harvardâ€TMs Academic Integrity policies. Outside of the small-group presentations, all work for this class, including the viewing log entries and final project, are to be completed independently. Please adhere to standard citation practices for all written work. Accommodations for Students With Disabilities: Harvard provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities. Please notify the professor as soon as possible if you expect to be receiving accommodations.

Email: emiliomora@fas.harvard.edu **Special Note for Course Preview Period: I will be available on the Monday, January 17th at 3:30-4:30 PM to discuss any question you have about the course. I will hold the session in zoom: https://harvard.zoom.us/j/8221295124 ** If you cannot attend this session but would like to ask me questions, feel free to reach out via email. Course Overview: In this course we will be examining the role and significance of groups (social, cultural, and institutional) in various areas of political philosophy. Although we will consider a variety of issues we will concentrate on two principal topics. Firstly, we will consider the significance of groups in relation to the claims and demands of social and political justice. Should social groups be thought to have a fundamental normative significance in political philosophy or must we reduce all political claims and interests to the claims and interests of individuals? What is the significance of social groups to questions of distributive justice? What sort of social groups are relevant to questions of distributive justice and why are they relevant? Are there group membership rights? What is the nature and foundation of these rights, and do these rights conflict with liberal political thought? The second dimension of the course concerns the significance of groups as subjects to the demands of justice. Do national groups bear responsibility as a group for what the group does? Can social groups in a society be deemed collectively responsible for certain social and political outcomes? What sorts of responsibilities do individuals incur through membership in social groups? What is the nature and mechanism of this group responsibility? Finally, we will consider the moral status and responsibilities of corporate â€ ̃group agentsâ€TM. Course texts: All class readings will be posted in pdf format on the Canvas course website in the 'Files' section. *NOTE* that there are readings for the first meeting on Tuesday, 25th January.

Reading and Writing Resources Writing and reading philosophy is hard. It can take a while to get familiar with the mechanics, style, and expectations of philosophical writing. In particular, if this is your first time with philosophy, donâ€TMt be discouraged by initial grades that donâ€TMt meet your expectations. In this course, you will have plenty of opportunity to improve your philosophical writing (and grade) throughout the semester. Feel free to come talk to me about any difficulties you are having. There are also several resources that are available to you to help with your reading and writing. The Department Writing Fellow can assist you in improving your philosophical writing, both generally and in relation to specific pieces of writing. More generally, the philosopher Jim Pryor has some excellent resources for learning how to read and write philosophy papers. You can find them at: http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/index.html (Links to an external site.) Course Policies Extensions: Extensions may be requested up until 2 days (48 hours) before papers are due. After this point, extensions may only be granted in the case of medical or family emergency.

Course texts: All class readings will be posted in pdf format on the Canvas course website in the 'Files' section. *NOTE* that there are readings for the first meeting on Tuesday, 25th January. Also note that readings may be subject to change throughout the semester. I will let you know about any changes through email and in class announcements but do check the course website for updates to the Syllabus.

Reading and Writing Resources Writing and reading philosophy is hard. It can take a while to get familiar with the mechanics, style, and expectations of philosophical writing. In particular, if this is your first time with philosophy, donâ€TMt be discouraged by initial grades that donâ€TMt meet your expectations. In this course, you will have plenty of opportunity to improve your philosophical writing (and grade) throughout the semester. Feel free to come talk to me about any difficulties you are having. There are also several resources that are available to you to help with your reading and writing. The Department Writing Fellow can assist you in improving your philosophical writing, both generally and in relation to specific pieces of writing. More generally, the philosopher Jim Pryor has some excellent resources for learning how to read and write philosophy papers. You can find them at: http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/index.html (Links to an external site.) Course Policies Extensions: Extensions may be requested up until 2 days (48 hours) before papers are due. After this point, extensions may only be granted in the case of medical or family emergency.

Reading responses must be submitted in class on the day the reading has been assigned. Assessment submitted after the deadline will incur an immediate penalty of one â€ ̃grade stepâ€TM (e.g. B+ to B), and a further â€ ̃grade stepâ€TM every 24 hours. Errors in the submission process will be your responsibility (e.g. missing file attachments, lost emails, corrupted files, etc.). All assessment must be completed to receive your final grade.

The syllabus can change to reflect what’s happening on campus, in our communities, the nation and the world.  COURSE DESCRIPTION  Welcome to journalism. Whether this is really your introduction to journalism or if you have practiced journalism in some way, get ready to jump in, learn the basics and begin to report and write.  We share a mission with journalists in New York City, throughout the U.S. and the world to report and tell stories that have meaning and impact. This is a difficult time for all journalists and it’s important to remember the challenges that we face and I’ll talk more about that in a minute.  Afghan Media worker  But first understand that there is so much that you can do with journalism. It offers you a chance to explore whatever interests you, to ask questions to frame a story as you see it and then tell the story in writing, video, photography, audio, and graphics. The possibilities for truthful storytelling keep expanding and providing opportunities.  Yes, the print world has lost newspapers, magazines and readers. There are news deserts in many states and small towns where people do not have honest, unbiased local news to relate the events of the day and keep them truthfully informed. In November 2021 the Washington Post reported that since 2005 about 2,200 local newspapers across America closed. That is bad for journalism and democracy.  Yet many news consumers seek out reliable news outlets. The New York Times added 2.3 million digital subscribers in 2020, bringing its readership to over 7.5 million. Subscriptions to the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal also increased by millions.  That is encouraging and so is that fact there are new platforms and outlets that showcase diverse journalism. The Marshall Project covers criminal justice. The Root, now owned by Univision, covers African American issues. Vice is a mini-empire. Vox Media is magazines, video, audio and more.  Pro Publica is a non-profit investigative journalism organization.  Buzzfeed covers culture and a lot more.  There are also initiatives like Report for America, which puts young journalists in communities where reporters are needed and there are many local news projects. For example, The Current is a non-profit that covers the coastal area of Georgia including Savannah. And there are more.  The point is that there is optimism for the future of journalism and your place in it as a journalist or a news consumer.  Yet we also must acknowledge the skepticism about journalism in some communities, attacks on journalists and the webs of lies, misinformation and disinformation that make it tough for us to do our work sometimes.  From the Philippines to Russia, Venezuela to Myanmar where a military coup essentially criminalized independent journalism, journalists face danger and still struggle do their jobs.  Here in New York during the summer of 2020 at least one video journalist was a target of protestors.  And on January 6, 2021, reporters doing their jobs covering the Capitol insurrection were attacked.  The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker found that at least 16 journalists were targeted during the Capitol riot. And throughout the country in 2021, 140 journalists were assaulted. This includes a parent attacking a journalist at a Michigan school board meeting.  What does all this say? Many continue to pursue careers as journalists and fulfill the mission enshrined in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to inform the public and hold the powerful to account.  So many things seem personal.  Objectivity may seem impossible when it feels like events conspire against us. But objectivity is a basic of principled journalism and I ask you to do your best to keep it in mind and put it into practice in your reporting. The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) offers an excellent code of ethics.  Journalist wrestle with issues about objectivity every day. Consider the work of the journalists who covered the January 6th insurrection. They had to tell it straight without taking it personally. That’s hard, but most understand the need to take a step back and try to report as objectively as we can.  Our country appears to be at an inflection point.  Image by Wolfgang Dvorak, Creative Commons License via Wikimedia     COVID-19 upended the way we live our lives, took family, friends, and neighbors from us, and highlighted racial and economic inequities. The murder of George Floyd showed us the cruelty of systemic racism and indifference to human life.

Photo by ConsumerMojo.com  The presidency of Donald Trump showed us that he, and some others we entrust with our votes, lie and think we will believe whatever they say if they say it loudly and repeat it over and over again.  Yet the chaos and heartbreak we have experienced sparked movements for change in racial justice, healthcare access, the way we treat our environment, and our economic safety net.  Where does journalism fit in here? Are you asking that question?  Screen shot of two reporters on CNN  Journalism is at the center of it all. It is at the heartbeat of our nation and the world.  Journalists report on what is going on around them and provide the context. They give readers, viewers, and listeners the information to make informed decisions. That’s the point of journalism and that’s what you will learn and practice in this class.  This course aims to give you a theoretical and practical understanding of what it takes to become a journalist and the importance of journalism to democracy.  At this challenging time in our country’s history, we need accurate reporting and talented journalists willing to dig deep, write, record, shoot, produce and give unbiased context to what happens in our communities, the nation, and the world.  Here in New York and elsewhere, we need committed journalists willing to go into our neighborhoods and report at ground level about what’s going on now. That’s what you’ll do for your class assignments.  In this class, you’ll learn how to write using the active voice to give your stories energy and power. You’ll learn how to identify what makes news, find, report and follow stories and gather information to craft into stories that can appear on multiple platforms.  Get ready to follow your curiosity, roll up your sleeves, put on your running shoes and practice journalism. Please make sure, as long as covid remains with us, that you always wear a mask and maintain at least a six-foot separation between you and anyone you interview.  We use award-winning HarlemView as our platform to post social justice stories about our community and the best class work is posted there. The best of the best is often picked up by Dateline CUNY, the website that publishes the best work from the CUNY colleges.  This is an Open Educational Resources class and that means you will not have to purchase a textbook. All of the class material will be posted on our class website: CCNY Introduction to Journalism-Truth Matters.  I also hope that you’ll write for The Campus and The Paper.  Course Learning Outcomes  This course will help you learn:  How to work ethically to find the truth, pursue accuracy,fairness and diversity, and report strong news stories.  How to use your analytic skills to determine what makes a news story.  How to think creatively, independently, and critically about local and world events.  How to gather information, synthesize complicated details, and craft a succinct, logical story with a beginning, middle and end.  How to write stories of 300 to 500 words for print, digital and other platforms.  How to gather information using photographs, video and audio effectively.

The syllabus can change to reflect what’s happening on campus, in our communities, the nation and the world. COURSE DESCRIPTION Welcome to journalism. Whether this is really your introduction to journalism or if you have practiced journalism in some way, get ready to jump in, learn the basics and begin to report and write. We share a mission with journalists in New York City, throughout the U.S. and the world to report and tell stories that have meaning and impact. This is a difficult time for all journalists and it’s important to remember the challenges that we face and I’ll talk more about that in a minute. Afghan Media worker But first understand that there is so much that you can do with journalism. It offers you a chance to explore whatever interests you, to ask questions to frame a story as you see it and then tell the story in writing, video, photography, audio, and graphics. The possibilities for truthful storytelling keep expanding and providing opportunities. Yes, the print world has lost newspapers, magazines and readers. There are news deserts in many states and small towns where people do not have honest, unbiased local news to relate the events of the day and keep them truthfully informed. In November 2021 the Washington Post reported that since 2005 about 2,200 local newspapers across America closed. That is bad for journalism and democracy. Yet many news consumers seek out reliable news outlets. The New York Times added 2.3 million digital subscribers in 2020, bringing its readership to over 7.5 million. Subscriptions to the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal also increased by millions. That is encouraging and so is that fact there are new platforms and outlets that showcase diverse journalism. The Marshall Project covers criminal justice. The Root, now owned by Univision, covers African American issues. Vice is a mini-empire. Vox Media is magazines, video, audio and more. Pro Publica is a non-profit investigative journalism organization. Buzzfeed covers culture and a lot more. There are also initiatives like Report for America, which puts young journalists in communities where reporters are needed and there are many local news projects. For example, The Current is a non-profit that covers the coastal area of Georgia including Savannah. And there are more. The point is that there is optimism for the future of journalism and your place in it as a journalist or a news consumer. Yet we also must acknowledge the skepticism about journalism in some communities, attacks on journalists and the webs of lies, misinformation and disinformation that make it tough for us to do our work sometimes. From the Philippines to Russia, Venezuela to Myanmar where a military coup essentially criminalized independent journalism, journalists face danger and still struggle do their jobs. Here in New York during the summer of 2020 at least one video journalist was a target of protestors. And on January 6, 2021, reporters doing their jobs covering the Capitol insurrection were attacked. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker found that at least 16 journalists were targeted during the Capitol riot. And throughout the country in 2021, 140 journalists were assaulted. This includes a parent attacking a journalist at a Michigan school board meeting. What does all this say? Many continue to pursue careers as journalists and fulfill the mission enshrined in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to inform the public and hold the powerful to account. So many things seem personal. Objectivity may seem impossible when it feels like events conspire against us. But objectivity is a basic of principled journalism and I ask you to do your best to keep it in mind and put it into practice in your reporting. The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) offers an excellent code of ethics. Journalist wrestle with issues about objectivity every day. Consider the work of the journalists who covered the January 6th insurrection. They had to tell it straight without taking it personally. That’s hard, but most understand the need to take a step back and try to report as objectively as we can. Our country appears to be at an inflection point.

Yet the chaos and heartbreak we have experienced sparked movements for change in racial justice, healthcare access, the way we treat our environment, and our economic safety net. Where does journalism fit in here? Are you asking that question? Screen shot of two reporters on CNN Journalism is at the center of it all. It is at the heartbeat of our nation and the world. Journalists report on what is going on around them and provide the context. They give readers, viewers, and listeners the information to make informed decisions. That’s the point of journalism and that’s what you will learn and practice in this class. This course aims to give you a theoretical and practical understanding of what it takes to become a journalist and the importance of journalism to democracy. At this challenging time in our country’s history, we need accurate reporting and talented journalists willing to dig deep, write, record, shoot, produce and give unbiased context to what happens in our communities, the nation, and the world. Here in New York and elsewhere, we need committed journalists willing to go into our neighborhoods and report at ground level about what’s going on now. That’s what you’ll do for your class assignments. In this class, you’ll learn how to write using the active voice to give your stories energy and power. You’ll learn how to identify what makes news, find, report and follow stories and gather information to craft into stories that can appear on multiple platforms. Get ready to follow your curiosity, roll up your sleeves, put on your running shoes and practice journalism. Please make sure, as long as covid remains with us, that you always wear a mask and maintain at least a six-foot separation between you and anyone you interview. We use award-winning HarlemView as our platform to post social justice stories about our community and the best class work is posted there.

This is an Open Educational Resources class and that means you will not have to purchase a textbook. All of the class material will be posted on our class website: CCNY Introduction to Journalism-Truth Matters. I also hope that you’ll write for The Campus and The Paper. Course Learning Outcomes This course will help you learn: How to work ethically to find the truth, pursue accuracy,fairness and diversity, and report strong news stories. How to use your analytic skills to determine what makes a news story. How to think creatively, independently, and critically about local and world events. How to gather information, synthesize complicated details, and craft a succinct, logical story with a beginning, middle and end. How to write stories of 300 to 500 words for print, digital and other platforms. How to gather information using photographs, video and audio effectively. How to use math and statistics to provide context. How to understand the changes in the media industry and what they mean for journalists and news consumers. How to meet deadlines.

Articles and links: I will post articles, links, and essays for you to read regularly on the class website and will include questions about the stories in the quizzes. Writing Assignments: You will have at least two reporting and writing assignments that we’ll peg to what’s happening in the city, country and the world. You have the option to report and write more for extra credit. The best stories from the class will appear on HarlemView, our journalism website. Attendance: Our class meets once a week. We have a lot of ground to cover and that means you need to come to class and show up on time. Two unexpected absences will mean you get a lower grade. If you must miss a class, email or text me in advance. If you miss more than four classes, we’ll ask you to withdraw from the course. Please don’t do this. Three instances of lateness will count as one unexcused absence. Please get into the excitement of journalism and come to class on time. Grading: Assignments: 40 percent Class participation and news quizzes: 30 percent Final writing, photography, video or audio project: 30 percent Class Conduct: Please put away your digital devices and other distractions. We need your full attention. Multi-tasking and concentration don’t mix. Please do not chat, or eat in the classroom. Journalism requires collaboration. We depend upon one another in newsrooms, in the field and in the classroom, and we need to play nice. Students will present their work in class for review and we want to provide positive feedback that helps them move their work forward. Analyze the work before you speak up and then offer constructive criticism. Try to start with something positive and then explain your criticism. Please use a word processor and double space your assignments. Assignments: I’d like to keep you close to the news and our assignments may vary depending upon what happens in the news cycle. The assignments listed on the syllabus are likely to change. I’ll edit your work so that you can improve week by week and you’ll be expected to rewrite and submit several drafts, if necessary. I will not grade your early work because you will get better and better as you continue to write. Class Calendar ***This may change as we move through the semester.

Our simple goals are to introduce you to some of the tools and skills needed to engage in multimedia storytelling in online environments. We aim to demystify the technical aspects of audiovisual information packaging by engaging in basic hands-on video and web exercises. However, what distinguishes this class from a skills-only course is its focus on storytelling. We ultimately intend to provide familiarity with the tools and an understanding of how to develop a narrative story with all these tools.

Required Digital Access LinkedIn Learning Follow the instructions here to access LinkedIn Learning with your onyen. https://software.sites.unc.edu/linkedin/ Adobe Premiere Follow the instructions here to create an Adobe ID and install the required software for free: http://software.sites.unc.edu/software/adobe-creative-cloud/ YouTube or Vimeo account You must use or create an account to publish your videos for this course. A YouTube account is included with any Gmail account, and there is no storage limit on YouTube accounts. A Vimeo account is free to create, but free accounts have restrictions on the total GB you can upload each week. Publishing your work on YouTube is easy and free, but Vimeo can have a more professional reputation. Course Goals and Accreditation The Hussman School of Journalism and Media accrediting body outlines a number of values you should be aware of and competencies you should be able to demonstrate by the time you graduate from our program. Learn more about them here: http://www2.ku.edu/~acejmc/PROGRAM/PRINCIPLES.SHTML#vals&comps No single course could possibly give you all of these values and competencies; but collectively, our classes are designed to build your abilities in each of these areas. In this class, we will address a number of the values and competencies, with special emphasis on the ""Professional values and competencies"" listed below. ● Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information. ● Demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity. ● Think critically, creatively and independently. ● Apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work. Late Assignments Accepting late assignments is unfair to the students who have sacrificed to turn their work in on time. An automatic 10 percent deduction will be applied to each assignment turned in after the time it is due, provided the assignment is turned in on the same day it is due. An additional 10% deduction will be applied for each subsequent 24 hours that pass after the due date/time (i.e., 10 percent is taken off for each day). Independent Online Research To teach you the necessary software tools to create your stories, this course will combine in-class demonstrations with online tutorials and videos. As beginners, it is inevitable that questions and technical problems will arise as you work with these tools. It is also not possible to cover every detail of a tool through in-class demos or assigned videos. The assignments will require you to learn how to learn new things independently, outside of direct instruction. While your instructor is always available to answer your questions and clarify any topic, this course will challenge you to troubleshoot your technical problems and figure out answers to your questions through independent online research. Before asking your question a technical or software- related question like “how do I...” or “ ... isn’t working”, it is expected that you will research your question online. Invest some time looking at manuals, forums and documentation sites to see if someone else has addressed your question or problem before. If you have conducted independent research online and still can’t find your answer, reach out to your instructor through email, in class, or during office hours. In addition to asking your question, share what you learned during your research, a description of your problem, and any relevant screenshots. Grading Work is graded according to the highest professional standards. Grades in percentages are: ● A = 95-100%, ● A- = 90-95%, ● B+ = 87-89%, ● B = 83-86%, ● B- = 80-82%, ● C+ = 77-79%, ● C = 73-76%, ● C- = 70-72%, ● D+ = 67-69%, ● D = 60-66% ● F = 59% or below Below is a guideline for how grades are described within this course: • A: Meets and exceeds basic project requirements, and work is exceptional – I would be excited about hiring you. The site looks polished, and the tweaks you’ve made to the theme help make your site better and more usable. The site makes use of multiple plug-ins in ways that make sense for the content. • B: Meets basic project requirements, and results are good. The site could use some small refinements. • C: Fails to meet at least one of the basic project requirements. Project doesn’t stand out, and the site needs several style refinements. • D: Fails to meet at least two of the basic project requirements. Project has multiple obvious flaws. • F: Fails to meet at least three of the basic project requirements. Project is incomplete. Grading Criteria In-class participation (see description below) 5% Video course work (includes exercises and video projects) 50% Web/Design course work (includes portfolio project) 25% Final project (includes final web page design and story/package integration) 20% In-class participation is your contribution within the scope of each class period, including arriving to live or online class meetings on time, asking questions, offering insights during class discussions, sharing feedback with peers, and general engagement with the material. The quality of your participation will be assigned a letter grade based on the guidelines above at the end of the course. You may check in with your instructor at any time during the course for individual feedback about the quality of your participation. Exercises and quizzes are assigned to familiarize you with skills needed to complete the projects and are graded on completion and execution quality. Engagement with the exercises and quizzes will prepare you to achieve better work on your projects. The video & web projects are assigned for you to demonstrate a mastery of the skills and storytelling techniques learned in class and with the exercises. The final project is an integrated package delivered via text, design and video and housed on your portfolio website. The package must contain integrated elements (story text, video and any additional elements you may choose). Final Project Due Date Dec2 2022 12pm (maybe subject to change) Honor Code It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him/herself within the guidelines of the Honor System (http://honor.unc.edu). All academic work should be done with the high level of honesty and integrity that this University demands. If you have any questions about your responsibility or your instructor’s responsibility as a faculty member under the Honor Code, please see the course instructor, speak with the senior associate dean of undergraduate studies in this school, and/or speak with a representative of the Student Attorney Office or the Office of the Dean of Students. Seeking Help If you need individual assistance, it is your responsibility to meet with Peter Doyle. If you are serious about wanting to improve your performance in the course, the time to seek help is as soon as you are aware of the problem, whether the problem is difficulty with course material, a disability, or an illness.

Grades in percentages are: ● A = 95-100%, ● A- = 90-95%, ● B+ = 87-89%, ● B = 83-86%, ● B- = 80-82%, ● C+ = 77-79%, ● C = 73-76%, ● C- = 70-72%, ● D+ = 67-69%, ● D = 60-66% ● F = 59% or below Below is a guideline for how grades are described within this course: • A: Meets and exceeds basic project requirements, and work is exceptional – I would be excited about hiring you. The site looks polished, and the tweaks you’ve made to the theme help make your site better and more usable. The site makes use of multiple plug-ins in ways that make sense for the content. • B: Meets basic project requirements, and results are good. The site could use some small refinements. • C: Fails to meet at least one of the basic project requirements. Project doesn’t stand out, and the site needs several style refinements. • D: Fails to meet at least two of the basic project requirements. Project has multiple obvious flaws. • F: Fails to meet at least three of the basic project requirements. Project is incomplete. Grading Criteria In-class participation (see description below) 5% Video course work (includes exercises and video projects) 50% Web/Design course work (includes portfolio project) 25% Final project (includes final web page design and story/package integration) 20% In-class participation is your contribution within the scope of each class period, including arriving to live or online class meetings on time, asking questions, offering insights during class discussions, sharing feedback with peers, and general engagement with the material. The quality of your participation will be assigned a letter grade based on the guidelines above at the end of the course. You may check in with your instructor at any time during the course for individual feedback about the quality of your participation. Exercises and quizzes are assigned to familiarize you with skills needed to complete the projects and are graded on completion and execution quality. Engagement with the exercises and quizzes will prepare you to achieve better work on your projects. The video & web projects are assigned for you to demonstrate a mastery of the skills and storytelling techniques learned in class and with the exercises. The final project is an integrated package delivered via text, design and video and housed on your portfolio website. The package must contain integrated elements (story text, video and any additional elements you may choose).

Principles of Finance and Global Financial Markets

Finance is fundamental to many public policy questions. When the financial sector works well, it
transfers resources from savers to borrowers, allowing individuals to save and businesses to
invest. When the financial sector works badly, resources are misallocated and financial crises
threaten the entire economy. This course provides an overview of financial markets and
institutions, and then considers the causes, consequences, and possibly policy responses to
financial crises.
Course requirements
There will be 2 problem sets, a short (5 page) paper, a midterm on 1/31, a second midterm on 3/7
and a final on April 23rd, 1:30pm-3:30pm. NOTE: THE FINAL WILL NOT BE
RESCHEDULED (except for medical reasons). IF YOU CANNOT MAKE THE FINAL
EXAM DATE, YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.
Grades will be weighted as follows:
• Problem sets and class participation: 10%
• Short paper: 30%
• Midterms: 30%
• Final: 30%

How to do well in this course
This course’s combination of economics and real-world applications makes it both challenging
and rewarding. To do well in the course, you will need to master some basic economic theory
underlying the operation of financial markets and institutions. The problem sets are designed to
help you do this. You will also need to learn a substantial amount about the (mostly recent)

history of financial crises. Much of class time will be spent on this, but it will also be essential
that you devote significant time to the readings. In number of pages, the reading list is light.
Rarely are more than 60 pages assigned in a week. But I expect that you will come to class
having read every page carefully. When parts of readings were not critical, I deliberately
assigned only excerpts.
Ford School Inclusivity Statement
Members of the Ford School community represent a rich variety of backgrounds and

Reading List
Required books:
Mishkin, Frederic S. and Stanley G. Eakins. Financial Markets and Institutions, Eighth Edition.
(Prentice Hall, 2015). Feel free to purchase the prior (7th) edition instead.
Mian, Atif and Amir Sufi. House of Debt: How They (and You) Caused the Great Recession, and
How We Can Prevent It from Happening Again. (University of Chicago, 2014).
Note: Other than these required books, all readings will be available online (if a link is provided
in the syllabus) or posted on Canvas. In addition to the required readings listed below, I will
often post optional readings for those who wish to pursue a topic further.
News: One reason to study finance is to better understand current events and policy discussions.
Thus I will frequently reference financial news in class, and while not required, I urge students to
follow the financial news. Three standard sources are the Wall Street Journal, the Financial
Times, and the Economist. Each offers discounted subscriptions for students
(https://education.wsj.com/students/, https://sub.ft.com/spa_stu/ ,

Course Coordinator Dr. Tatiana Voza (Biological Sciences) City Tech Office; A502, Phone: (718) 260-5969 INSTRUCTORS (to fill-in by student) Lecture Name: Email: Phone: Labs Name: Email: Phone: Page 1 of 10 Biology II – BIO 1201 / City Tech – CUNY Biological Sciences Department / SP 2022 Description of the Online Course Structure & Expectations A. Asynchronous lecture classes have a “TBA” mention shown on CUNYfirst. This means that there are no scheduled class meetings for this component (lab or lecture) of the course. Your instructor is however available via email or Zoom to help and assist you. Please reach out to your instructor by email and/or consult the “professor contact” section on Blackboard or CUNYfirst for more information. B. In-person classes have a day, time and room dedicated to class meetings shown on CUNYfirst. You are expected to be available during these times and attending the class meetings. Lab coats are to be worn for each and every lab class. C. For each lecture, in addition to attending class (if in-person), you are expected to: a. Read the textbook chapter(s) b. Watch the lecture video, go over the slides (all posted on Blackboard and/or OpenLab course site) c. Complete the related quizzes and other assessments on the topic(s) covered in the lecture (posted on Blackboard). These quizzes have to be completed before the indicated deadlines and will count towards the lecture attendance/participation grade (20% of the lecture component grade). D. There are four (4) lecture exams and none is cumulative. The average on the lecture exams represents 80% of the lecture component grade. E. For each lab, in addition to attending class (if designated as synchronous or in-person), you are expected to: a. Read the lab manual chapter(s) (PDFs available on the OpenLab course site) b. Complete the corresponding Lab activities/assignments (posted on Blackboard). These assignments have to be completed before the indicated deadlines and will count towards the lab attendance/participation grade (20% of the lab component grade). F. There are at least five (5) timed lab quizzes and two (2) timed lab practical exams (Midterm and Final). These tests are posted on Blackboard and should be completed before the indicated deadlines. The lab quiz average represents 30% of the lab component grade, while each of the practical exams is 25% of the lab component grade. G. This is a ZTC course (Zero Texbook Costs) and all the course material (textbook chapters, review sheets, lecture slides, videos and more) is available here: https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/oer-biology/ . Your instructor might also provide you with additional material and links. H. To pass the class it is necessary to pass both the lecture and lab components, i.e. obtain a grade of at least 60% for each. You will not pass if you get a failing grade in either lecture or lab, even though you score 100% in the other component. I. Emails, Blackboard and Connectivity: It is your responsibility to regularly check the email account you provided to the school and Blackboard for announcements, reminders and grades; make sure all media are in working order on your end. Contact the Student Helpdesk for any assistance. J. Makeup Tests: There is a “no makeup” policy. Thus, makeup tests are rarely granted and, when they are, they are scheduled at the end of the semester, with final exams, and a point penalty is also applied. Below are: i. The grading policy breakdown ii. Lecture and lab schedule grids iii. Academic Integrity policy, Accessibility and Online Conference Consent statements iv.

Course Information and Procedures
Location and time
Class meets Monday and Wednesday 2:30-4:00 in 1220 Weill.
Description
Finance is fundamental to many public policy questions. When the financial sector works well, it
transfers resources from savers to borrowers, allowing individuals to save and businesses to
invest. When the financial sector works badly, resources are misallocated and financial crises
threaten the entire economy. This course provides an overview of financial markets and
institutions, and then considers the causes, consequences, and possibly policy responses to
financial crises.
Course requirements
There will be 2 problem sets, a short (5 page) paper, a midterm on 1/31, a second midterm on 3/7
and a final on April 23rd, 1:30pm-3:30pm. NOTE: THE FINAL WILL NOT BE
RESCHEDULED (except for medical reasons). IF YOU CANNOT MAKE THE FINAL
EXAM DATE, YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.
Grades will be weighted as follows:
• Problem sets and class participation: 10%
• Short paper: 30%
• Midterms: 30%
• Final: 30%

How to do well in this course
This course’s combination of economics and real-world applications makes it both challenging
and rewarding. To do well in the course, you will need to master some basic economic theory
underlying the operation of financial markets and institutions. The problem sets are designed to
help you do this. You will also need to learn a substantial amount about the (mostly recent)

history of financial crises. Much of class time will be spent on this, but it will also be essential
that you devote significant time to the readings. In number of pages, the reading list is light.
Rarely are more than 60 pages assigned in a week. But I expect that you will come to class
having read every page carefully. When parts of readings were not critical, I deliberately
assigned only excerpts.

","Public Policy 
Principles of Finance and Global Financial Markets

Finance is fundamental to many public policy questions. When the financial sector works well, it
transfers resources from savers to borrowers, allowing individuals to save and businesses to
invest. When the financial sector works badly, resources are misallocated and financial crises
threaten the entire economy. This course provides an overview of financial markets and
institutions, and then considers the causes, consequences, and possibly policy responses to
financial crises.

There will be 2 problem sets, a short (5 page) paper, a midterm on 1/31, a second midterm on 3/7
and a final on April 23rd, 1:30pm-3:30pm. NOTE: THE FINAL WILL NOT BE
RESCHEDULED (except for medical reasons). IF YOU CANNOT MAKE THE FINAL
EXAM DATE, YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.
Grades will be weighted as follows:


How to do well in this course
This course’s combination of economics and real-world applications makes it both challenging
and rewarding. To do well in the course, you will need to master some basic economic theory
underlying the operation of financial markets and institutions. The problem sets are designed to
help you do this. You will also need to learn a substantial amount about the (mostly recent)

history of financial crises. Much of class time will be spent on this, but it will also be essential
that you devote significant time to the readings. In number of pages, the reading list is light.
Rarely are more than 60 pages assigned in a week. But I expect that you will come to class
having read every page carefully. When parts of readings were not critical, I deliberately
assigned only excerpts.

Course Description
This course is about communication. Specifically, we will use various media elements (text, graphics, animation, video and sound) to form communicative units. The purpose of a multimedia piece is to communicate your message to the audience. The goal of this course is to use type, color, illustrations, images,
sound, animation and video to produce professional materials. This course will teach a combination of
graphic design skills and software skills. Students will also learn the terminology, procedures and production requirement to effectively communicate with ad agencies, design firms and commercial printers.
Throughout the course students will learn the skills of the following applications:
• Adobe InDesign • Adobe Illustrator
• Adobe Photoshop • Adobe Audition
• Adobe After Effects • Adobe Premiere
Each of the above software programs will have one or two projects/assignments that will be completed
by the student. These applications are available in the classroom as well as several public clusters.
While the class offers a jump-start to these applications, students are expected to explore the higher
level features on their own.
Objectives
By the end of the class you will be able to...
• Create professional multi-media material using a variety of Adobe software.
• Be able to effectively communicate to your target audience using a variety of mutli-media programs.
• Become familiar with media design principles.
• Become familiar with graphic design/multi-media terminology.
• Be able to effectively communicate with clients, design firms and media content professionals.
Course Structure
• Class will usually consist of 3/4 lecture and 1/4 hands-on work with the software.
• Class attendance and participation is critical to learning in this class.
• I strongly suggest the purchasing of a USB - Jump - Flash portable storage device.
Cheating and Plagiarism
Students must do all of the assignments individually. Students may receive feedback on their work from
other students, but the final work must be their own. Students are subject to Carnegie Mellon University’s policies on academic integrity. Plagiarism is a serious offense that can result in the student failing
the course. Note that all academic integrity violations will be reported to the Associate Dean. Additional
penalties may be imposed.

Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Academic Integrity
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm
Students at Carnegie Mellon are engaged in intellectual activity consistent with the highest standards of the academy. The relationship between students and instructors and their shared commitment to overarching standards of respect, honor and transparency
determine the integrity of our community of scholars. The actions of our students, faculty and staff are a representation of our
university community and of the professional and personal communities that we lead. Therefore, a deep and abiding commitment
to academic integrity is fundamental to a Carnegie Mellon education. Honesty and good faith, clarity in the communication of core
values, professional conduct of work, mutual trust and respect, and fairness and exemplary behavior represent the expectations for
ethical behavior for all members of the Carnegie Mellon community.
Policy Statement
In any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce her/his own original academic work. Collaboration
or assistance on academic work to be graded is not permitted unless explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may
utilize the assistance provided by Academic Development, the Global Communication Center, and the Academic Resource Center
(CMU-Q) unless specifically prohibited by the course instructor(s). Any other sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the course instructor(s).
In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. When collaboration or assistance is permitted by the course
instructor(s) or when a student utilizes the services provided by Academic Development, the Global Communication Center, and the
Academic Resource Center (CMU-Q), the acknowledgement of any collaboration or assistance is likewise required. This citation
and acknowledgement must be incorporated into the work submitted and not separately or at a later point in time. Failure to do so is
dishonest and is subject to disciplinary action.
Instructors have a duty to communicate their expectations including those specific to collaboration, assistance, citation and acknowledgement within each course. Students likewise have a duty to ensure that they understand and abide by the standards that apply in
any course or academic activity. In the absence of such understanding, it is the student’s responsibility to seek additional information
and clarification.
Policy Violations
Cheating occurs when a student avails her/himself of an unfair or disallowed advantage which includes but is not limited to:
1. Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from previous course offerings.
2. Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.
3. Copying from the examination or work of another person or source.
4. Submission or use of falsified data.
5. Using false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation.
6. Falsification of academic credentials.
Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation. Unique
ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be
graded. Examples of sources expected to be referenced include but are not limited to:
 Text, either written or spoken, quoted directly or paraphrased.
 Graphic elements.
 Passages of music, existing either as sound or as notation.
 Mathematical proofs.
 Scientific data.
 Concepts or material derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person.
Unauthorized assistance refers to the use of sources of support that have not been specifically authorized in this policy statement or
by the course instructor(s) in the completion of academic work to be graded. Such sources of support may include but are not limited
to advice or help provided by another individual, published or unpublished written sources, and electronic sources. Examples of
unauthorized assistance include but are not limited to:
1. Collaboration on any assignment beyond the standards authorized by this policy statement and the course instructor(s).
2. Submission of work completed or edited in whole or in part by another person.
3. Supplying or communicating unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous
course offerings, in any way to another student.
4. Use of unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous course offerings.
5. Use of unauthorized devices.
6. Submission for credit of previously completed graded work in a second course without first obtaining permission from the
instructor(s) of the second course. In the case of concurrent courses, permission to submit the same work for credit in two courses
must be obtained from the instructors of both courses.
Procedures for dealing with allegations of these policy violations are detailed in the university’s Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures for Undergraduate Students and the Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures for Graduate Students, which are published
in The WORD student handbook. Periodic review of these procedures will be overseen by the Dean of Student Affairs or her/his
designee in consultation with Faculty Senate and the relevant student governing bodies. Any amendments to these procedures are
subject to the approval of Faculty Senate. Additional guidelines and procedures for graduate students may exist at the college/department/program level, in which case they are communicated in the college/department/program graduate student handbook.",,"This course is about communication.

1. Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from previous course offerings.
2. Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.
3. Copying from the examination or work of another person or source.
4. Submission or use of falsified data.
5. Using false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation.
6. Falsification of academic credentials.
Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation. Unique
ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be
graded. Examples of sources expected to be referenced include but are not limited to:
 Text, either written or spoken, quoted directly or paraphrased.
 Graphic elements.
 Passages of music, existing either as sound or as notation.
 Mathematical proofs.
 Scientific data.
 Concepts or material derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person.
Unauthorized assistance refers to the use of sources of support that have not been specifically authorized in this policy statement or
by the course instructor(s) in the completion of academic work to be graded. Such sources of support may include but are not limited
to advice or help provided by another individual, published or unpublished written sources, and electronic sources. Examples of
unauthorized assistance include but are not limited to:
1. Collaboration on any assignment beyond the standards authorized by this policy statement and the course instructor(s).
2. Submission of work completed or edited in whole or in part by another person.
3. Supplying or communicating unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous
course offerings, in any way to another student.
4. Use of unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous course offerings.
5. Use of unauthorized devices.
6. Submission for credit of previously completed graded work in a second course without first obtaining permission from the
instructor(s) of the second course. In the case of concurrent courses, permission to submit the same work for credit in two courses
must be obtained from the instructors of both courses.
Procedures for dealing with allegations of these policy violations are detailed in the university’s Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures for Undergraduate Students and the Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures for Graduate Students, which are published
in The WORD student handbook. Periodic review of these procedures will be overseen by the Dean of Student Affairs or her/his
designee in consultation with Faculty Senate and the relevant student governing bodies. Any amendments to these procedures are
subject to the approval of Faculty Senate. Additional guidelines and procedures for graduate students may exist at the college/department/program level, in which case they are communicated in the college/department/program graduate student handbook.
","This course is about communication. Specifically, we will use various media elements (text, graphics, animation, video and sound) to form communicative units. The purpose of a multimedia piece is to communicate your message to the audience. The goal of this course is to use type, color, illustrations, images,
sound, animation and video to produce professional materials. This course will teach a combination of
graphic design skills and software skills. Students will also learn the terminology, procedures and production requirement to effectively communicate with ad agencies, design firms and commercial printers.
Throughout the course students will learn the skills of the following applications:
• Adobe InDesign • Adobe Illustrator
• Adobe Photoshop • Adobe Audition
• Adobe After Effects • Adobe Premiere
Each of the above software programs will have one or two projects/assignments that will be completed
by the student. These applications are available in the classroom as well as several public clusters.
While the class offers a jump-start to these applications, students are expected to explore the higher
level features on their own.
Objectives
By the end of the class you will be able to...
• Create professional multi-media material using a variety of Adobe software.
• Be able to effectively communicate to your target audience using a variety of mutli-media programs.
• Become familiar with media design principles.
• Become familiar with graphic design/multi-media terminology.
• Be able to effectively communicate with clients, design firms and media content professionals.
Course Structure
• Class will usually consist of 3/4 lecture and 1/4 hands-on work with the software.
• Class attendance and participation is critical to learning in this class.
• I strongly suggest the purchasing of a USB - Jump - Flash portable storage device.
Cheating and Plagiarism
Students must do all of the assignments individually. Students may receive feedback on their work from
other students, but the final work must be their own. Students are subject to Carnegie Mellon University’s policies on academic integrity. Plagiarism is a serious offense that can result in the student failing
the course. Note that all academic integrity violations will be reported to the Associate Dean. Additional
penalties may be imposed.

Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Academic Integrity
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm
Students at Carnegie Mellon are engaged in intellectual activity consistent with the highest standards of the academy. The relationship between students and instructors and their shared commitment to overarching standards of respect, honor and transparency
determine the integrity of our community of scholars. The actions of our students, faculty and staff are a representation of our
university community and of the professional and personal communities that we lead. Therefore, a deep and abiding commitment
to academic integrity is fundamental to a Carnegie Mellon education. Honesty and good faith, clarity in the communication of core
values, professional conduct of work, mutual trust and respect, and fairness and exemplary behavior represent the expectations for
ethical behavior for all members of the Carnegie Mellon community.
Policy Statement
In any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce her/his own original academic work. Collaboration
or assistance on academic work to be graded is not permitted unless explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may
utilize the assistance provided by Academic Development, the Global Communication Center, and the Academic Resource Center
(CMU-Q) unless specifically prohibited by the course instructor(s). Any other sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the course instructor(s).
In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. When collaboration or assistance is permitted by the course
instructor(s) or when a student utilizes the services provided by Academic Development, the Global Communication Center, and the
Academic Resource Center (CMU-Q), the acknowledgement of any collaboration or assistance is likewise required. This citation
and acknowledgement must be incorporated into the work submitted and not separately or at a later point in time. Failure to do so is
dishonest and is subject to disciplinary action.
Instructors have a duty to communicate their expectations including those specific to collaboration, assistance, citation and acknowledgement within each course. Students likewise have a duty to ensure that they understand and abide by the standards that apply in
any course or academic activity. In the absence of such understanding, it is the student’s responsibility to seek additional information
and clarification.

Required Texts and Learning Materials
This seminar course is a series of thematic conversations about human values and your
responsibilities as an emerging/aspiring business leader. There is no traditional textbook, but there is
much reading. You will find details about required learning materials in the syllabus (below) and on the
Blackboard Weekly Theme Briefs.
Required Workbook: Thompson, Lindsay. The Moral Compass Workbook. (Blackboard)
Note about Readings and Learning Resources
Readings, video/audio clips, websites, and other course materials are a starting point for inquiry and
discussion around each theme. All of the required learning materials are available via the internet or
Blackboard either in Course Documents or E-Reserves link to the Johns Hopkins libraries. Be sure
that your electronic access to Blackboard, libraries, and other Johns Hopkins websites is activated via
your computer and working effectively.
You are expected to read at least one mainstream business news source regularly. You will rely on
news sources to identify “live cases” that exemplify key ethical issues in business drawn from current
events and the observations and experiences you and your learning colleagues bring to class. You
should also be familiar with the range of business media, websites, and journals as a source of
intelligence and insight on business leadership and values. A list of these sources is provided under
Course Documents on Blackboard.
Course Description and Overview
This course explores ethical leadership as a framework for enterprise value creation in a complex
environment of competing value claims. Students examine the intrinsic ethical and moral challenges
of business and the concept of a moral compass as a foundation for conscientious leadership,
business practice, and value creation in a competitive global economy. You should read the Seminar
Preparation section in Blackboard prior to the first class. It will also be useful to learn more about the
learning theory underlying the design and implementation of this course. You are encouraged to read This study source was downloaded by 100000853212041 from CourseHero.com on 10-27-2022 12:43:12 GMT -05:00

the two documents on transformational learning and constructive learning posted in the Course
Documents section of Blackboard.
Prerequisite(s) None
Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Explain the role of human values in business leadership.
2. Develop and justify an action plan to manage an ethical challenge.
3. Lead purposeful conversations about values and ethics.
4. Foster personal moral wellbeing.
To view the complete list of Carey Business School’s general learning goals and objectives, visit the
Carey website.
Course Policies
Throughout the seminar you will explore the architecture of human values from various dimensions:
personal, organizational, societal, cultural, and cross-cultural. The seminar provides the opportunity
for you to cultivate skills and dispositions of self-awareness, critical thinking, collaborative inquiry,
dialogue, discernment, and decision making that will foster your effectiveness as a values-empowered
leader.
Peer Learning and Class Participation
You are required to participate actively in building a peer learning community. Rather than learning
about values, the Business Leadership and Human Values seminar engages you with the Carey
Business Credo, Business with Humanity in Mind, challenging you to anchor value creation in
human values. You will be challenged by discussing these ideas and values with your classmates to
envision business leadership as a moral trust others place in you to manage assets, solve problems,
and lead people in creating sustainable wealth.
Note: If you have a question about the course, you should post it to the “Questions” forum on the Bb
discussion board. This is the primary medium for gaining clarity about course-related items. If you
have a question that is personal, you should contact the instructor or TA directly by email.

BUSINESS LEADERSHIP AND HUMAN VALUES
One hour before class and other times by appointment.
Required Texts and Learning Materials
This seminar course is a series of thematic conversations about human values and your
responsibilities as an emerging/aspiring business leader. There is no traditional textbook, but there is
much reading. You will find details about required learning materials in the syllabus (below) and on the
Blackboard Weekly Theme Briefs.
Required Workbook: Thompson, Lindsay. The Moral Compass Workbook. (Blackboard)
Note about Readings and Learning Resources
Readings, video/audio clips, websites, and other course materials are a starting point for inquiry and
discussion around each theme. All of the required learning materials are available via the internet or
Blackboard either in Course Documents or E-Reserves link to the Johns Hopkins libraries. Be sure
that your electronic access to Blackboard, libraries, and other Johns Hopkins websites is activated via
your computer and working effectively.
You are expected to read at least one mainstream business news source regularly. You will rely on
news sources to identify “live cases” that exemplify key ethical issues in business drawn from current
events and the observations and experiences you and your learning colleagues bring to class. You
should also be familiar with the range of business media, websites, and journals as a source of
intelligence and insight on business leadership and values. A list of these sources is provided under
Course Documents on Blackboard.
Course Description and Overview
This course explores ethical leadership as a framework for enterprise value creation in a complex
environment of competing value claims. Students examine the intrinsic ethical and moral challenges
of business and the concept of a moral compass as a foundation for conscientious leadership,
business practice, and value creation in a competitive global economy. You should read the Seminar
Preparation section in Blackboard prior to the first class. It will also be useful to learn more about the
learning theory underlying the design and implementation of this course. You are encouraged to read This study source was downloaded by 100000853212041 from CourseHero.com on 10-27-2022 12:43:12 GMT -05:00

the two documents on transformational learning and constructive learning posted in the Course
Documents section of Blackboard.
Prerequisite(s) None
Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Explain the role of human values in business leadership.
2. Develop and justify an action plan to manage an ethical challenge.
3. Lead purposeful conversations about values and ethics.
4. Foster personal moral wellbeing.
To view the complete list of Carey Business School’s general learning goals and objectives, visit the
Carey website.
Course Policies
Throughout the seminar you will explore the architecture of human values from various dimensions:
personal, organizational, societal, cultural, and cross-cultural. The seminar provides the opportunity
for you to cultivate skills and dispositions of self-awareness, critical thinking, collaborative inquiry,
dialogue, discernment, and decision making that will foster your effectiveness as a values-empowered
leader.
Peer Learning and Class Participation
You are required to participate actively in building a peer learning community. Rather than learning
about values, the Business Leadership and Human Values seminar engages you with the Carey
Business Credo, Business with Humanity in Mind, challenging you to anchor value creation in
human values. You will be challenged by discussing these ideas and values with your classmates to
envision business leadership as a moral trust others place in you to manage assets, solve problems,
and lead people in creating sustainable wealth.
Note: If you have a question about the course, you should post it to the “Questions” forum on the Bb
discussion board. This is the primary medium for gaining clarity about course-related items. If you
have a question that is personal, you should contact the instructor or TA directly by email.

There will be some reserved readings posted on Blackboard throughout
the semester outside of the textbook. These readings will be used to
provide more in depth perspectives on relevant topics.
Statement of Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
The School of Education at Boston University is committed to equal
access for students with disabilities. If you have a specific disability
and require accommodations in this class, please let me know early in
the semester so that appropriate accommodations can be made. You
must provide me with a letter of needed accommodations prepared by
the Office of Disability Services. Contact for that office is as follows:
(617) 353-3658 V/TTY or access@bu.edu. All discussions and written
materials will be kept confidential.
Academic Conduct
Academic integrity is the bedrock of any scholarly community. The
objective of Boston University in enforcing academic rules is to
promote a community atmosphere in which learning and the pursuit of
knowledge can best take place.
As articulated in the Academic Conduct Code “All students at Boston
University are expected to maintain high standards of academic
honesty and integrity. It is the responsibility of every student to be
aware of the Academic Conduct Code’s contents and to abide by its
provisions” (http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conductcode/).
In general, academic misconduct is conduct by which a student
misrepresents his or her academic accomplishments, or impedes other
students’ opportunities of being judged fairly for their academic work.
Students should pay particular attention to the rules regarding
plagiarism, teamwork, submission of work to more than one course
without permission, and conduct in a professional field
assignment. Plagiarism, that is, failure to properly acknowledge
sources, written or electronic, used for verbatim quotations or ideas, is
a violation of academic integrity. Each student is responsible for
learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing and footnoting,
quotation, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original
author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly
acknowledged. If students have any questions about academic
integrity or how it applies to the assignments in a specific course,
students should consult their instructor.

COURSE EXPECATIONS
Attendance and Participation
Attendance to every class is important because it is heavily reliant on
participation. We aim to create an interactive culture and group work
during the semester, so the quality of the course depends on your
consistent attendance and participation. Should you find it difficult to
speak in front of a group, contact us by the second week of the
semester so that we can work out alternative ways for you to
participate. Missing any class time may impact your participation
grade. If you are going to miss a class, please let us know ahead of
time and contact a classmate for material missed during the session.
You will be required to turn in a 1-page reflection on each reading (i.e.,
1 page for each article of chapter). If you miss class and do not
turn in a 1-page summary for each article you be deducted 2
points in your attendance/participation grade. If you miss more
than three classes during the semester, you are at risk for failing the
course. Please talk to us regarding any exceptional circumstances.

Statement of Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
The School of Education at Boston University is committed to equal
access for students with disabilities. If you have a specific disability
and require accommodations in this class, please let me know early in
the semester so that appropriate accommodations can be made. You
must provide me with a letter of needed accommodations prepared by
the Office of Disability Services. Contact for that office is as follows:
All discussions and written
materials will be kept confidential.
Academic Conduct
Academic integrity is the bedrock of any scholarly community. The
objective of Boston University in enforcing academic rules is to
promote a community atmosphere in which learning and the pursuit of
knowledge can best take place.
As articulated in the Academic Conduct Code “All students at Boston
University are expected to maintain high standards of academic
honesty and integrity. It is the responsibility of every student to be
aware of the Academic Conduct Code’s contents and to abide by its
provisions” In general, academic misconduct is conduct by which a student
misrepresents his or her academic accomplishments, or impedes other
students’ opportunities of being judged fairly for their academic work.
Students should pay particular attention to the rules regarding
plagiarism, teamwork, submission of work to more than one course
without permission, and conduct in a professional field
assignment. Plagiarism, that is, failure to properly acknowledge
sources, written or electronic, used for verbatim quotations or ideas, is
a violation of academic integrity. Each student is responsible for
learning and using proper methods of paraphrasing and footnoting,
quotation, and other forms of citation, to ensure that the original
author, speaker, illustrator, or source of the material used is clearly
acknowledged. If students have any questions about academic
integrity or how it applies to the assignments in a specific course,
students should consult their instructor.

Description of Small Group Facilitator: You will sign up for a topic to
write a 2 page paper and facilitate a small group discussion.
For the paper, you will find a written work (i.e., journal article or article
from a reputable media source) that is related to your topic and write a 2
page paper. The paper should include, 1) brief summary of the written work
(no more than 2 paragraphs), 2) how it relates to your topic, 3) personal
application (i.e., how could you use this information in the future?), and 4)
Three questions you plan to ask to facilitate the small group discussion.
Please submit your paper via email. The paper is due 5pm the day
before you are scheduled to lead the small group discussion (so if
you are scheduled to facilitate on 10/12, you must send the paper to
by 4:59pm on 10/11). For the facilitation,
you will lead a 10-minute small group discussion and use the questions you
wrote in your paper to guide the discussion).

II. Course Description, Learning Goals, Structure, & Materials
II.1a. Course Description & Learning Goals
 Introduces the basic principles, methods, and challenges of modern managerial accounting.
Covers traditional topics such as job-order costing, cost-volume-profit analysis, budgeting,
variance analysis, profitability analysis, relevant costs for decision making, and cost-plus pricing,
as well as less traditional topics such as Activity-Based Cost (ABC) accounting and performance
measurement. The material is examined from the perspective of students preparing to use
accounting information as managers, to support decision making (such as pricing, product mix,
sourcing, technology and investment decisions) and short- and long-term planning, and to
measure, evaluate, and reward performance. Emphasizes the relationships between accounting
techniques and other organizational activities. 4 cr.
II.1b. Course Learning Objectives
 Learn terminology to describe, categorize, and analyze the costs of doing business
 Understand how costs behave in relation to changes in volume
 Distinguish between the direct and indirect costs of products and services, and learn benefits
and drawbacks of different methods of allocating indirect costs to the objectives those costs
help to achieve
 Prepare a master budget as well as each of its components and understand how to use it to
manage operations
 Learn to make strategic decisions, using financial and non-financial information
 Gain an understanding of the basics of performance measurement
 Become proficient in variance analysis

AC222 – Managerial Accounting Fall, 2020
II.2. Course Structure & Pedagogy
 Module 1 – Understand cost terms, definitions and concepts relating to the operations of a business.
Understand how those costs behave in relation to changes in volume and the implications of this
relationship on firm risk.
 Module 2 – Managerial analysis, learn a tool set to make better business decisions
 Module 3 – Learn to construct budgets and to use those to control/improve operations
 Module 4 – Learn how to assess the performance of a business
II.3. Course Materials:
III. Managerial Accounting, Davis and Davis, 4th edition. You will need this version, not a
previous, nor an international version. Available at Barnes & Noble or online through
Wiley. This version is bundled with WileyPlus access, which you will need for this course.
A used book will not come with WileyPlus access, so if you buy a used version, you will
need to purchase WileyPlus access separately. If you purchase WileyPlus access by itself,
you receive access to an e-book included in the price
IV. Course Policies
III.1. Attendance Policy and Contribution Score (valid only through exam 1, thereafter attendance
is no longer mandatory, but suggested)
 Attendance is expected and the easiest way to do well in the participation portion of the class. While
attendance alone does NOT ensure a good contribution score, it will be much harder to achieve a
good contribution score without attending class. Arriving on time is expected. Students who arrive
late disrupt the learning process of everyone who made it to class on time. Late arrivals will bear a
penalty to participation. I will not distinguish between “excused or unexcused absences”.
 BU policy and Massachusetts State Law consider absences for religious reasons to be “excused” but
as far as I am aware there are not more than 3 major religious holidays scheduled during this course,
and as such, no one should need to miss more than 3 classes.
 If you are not able to attend the live session of the class, you are expected to watch a video recording
of the lecture. In addition, you will need to participate in the online discussion forums. Failure to
participate in live class sessions as well as not participating in the online discussion forums and not
providing case feedback will be grounds for a 0 in the contribution portion of the class.
III.2. Academic accommodations for students with special needs:
 In keeping with University policy, any student with a disability who needs or thinks they need
academic accommodations must call the Office of Disability Services at 617-353-3658 or stop by 19
Deerfield Street to arrange a confidential appointment with a Disability Services staff member.
Accommodation letters must be delivered to your instructor in a timely fashion (not later than two
weeks before any major examination). Please note that accommodations will not be delivered
absent an official letter of accommodation.
III.3. Academic Integrity Policy
 The Questrom Academic Conduct Code is strictly observed in this course. Consider it to be an
addendum to this syllabus. I assume that if you continue in this course, you have read and
understood the Academic Conduct Code. Penalties for infractions range from a minimum of a zero
grade on the test or assignment, to an appearance before the Academic Conduct Committee, which
could result in suspension or expulsion from Boston University.
III.4. Diversity and Inclusion Statement
 In developing this course, I have aimed to be thoughtful about how identity, abilities, experiences
and culture impact the course content.

 I invite you to share your personal experiences and perspective related to the course content. If there
are topics or conversations that you feel would benefit from incorporation of social context, a
differing perspective, or Questrom’s Office of Diversity & Inclusion, please inform me and I will
explore resources and opportunities for us to engage a wide variety of perspectives in our classroom.
V. Course Evaluation & Expectations
IV.1. Course Evaluation
 Grading: The relative weighting of assignments in your course grade is as follows:
 Evaluation Activity Fraction of Course Grade
Mid-Term Exam #1 20%
Mid-Term Exam #2 20%
Exit Questions 5%
Introductory Video 5%
Final Exam 25%
Class Contribution 5%
Individual WileyPlus homework submissions 5%
Case feedback scores 5%
Case #1 (Ethics Case) 5%
 Case #2 (Variance Analysis or Budgeting Case) 5%
 TOTAL 100%
 There will be absolutely no grade deflation in this course (There will also, however, not be any
grade inflation). Final course grades will be the result of a direct mathematical computation,
based on the formula above and the distribution below.
o Questrom’s grading guidelines for required UG courses:
25-35% of students can expect to receive A’s (for excellent work)
50-65% of students can expect to receive B’s (for good or very good work)
5-20% of students can expect to receive C’s or below (for adequate or poor work)
 If you have any questions about grades that you receive on particular assignments, you must raise
them within two weeks of receiving your grade on that assignment. Unless we have made
computational errors, we will be unable to alter grades after final grades have been determined.
If you have particular grade-related considerations that you think are important, please raise
these with your instructor as early as possible (during the first half of the semester at the latest!),
so that your instructor can help you approach the course in a way that will help you achieve your
best possible performance.
IV.2. Assignment Descriptions & Expectations
 WileyPlus homework: Each chapter in the book has a homework assignment associated with the
online system. Submissions are due one week after the associated material was covered in class. I
suggest you do not fall behind in these assignments as they are meant to be material to reinforce
what we did in lecture each day after completing each class. I will give a full score to anyone who
completes more than 90% of the material correctly. Scores below 90% will be graded as the
reported score multiplied by the number of points possible for the assignment.
 Case submissions: We will cover two cases in this course. The cases are a lot of fun and highly
interactive. Because they are so interactive, they are a great opportunity for you to gain a lot of
contribution points. In order to ensure that everyone comes to class prepared, you will be assigned a
1-page summary level response to a question about the case that will be posted at least one week
prior to the case being covered in class. These write ups should NOT exceed 1.5 pages, nor be less
than 0.5 pages, 12-point Times New Roman, double spaced. My goal with this assignment is to give
you an opportunity to simply show me how much you know about the topic and how it is applied to
the case in question. The majority of these submissions will receive 4/5. If your statements in the
case are logically inconsistent or incorrect, your grade will drop by .5 points for each error. If you

make exceptionally insightful comments your grade will increase by .5 points per observation. Note
that you get to drop your lowest case score of the three.
 Case feedback: You will review the submission of 3 different classmates. You will be randomly
assigned the case submission of other students for which you will need to provide feedback and rate
their submission as either meets expectations, exceeds expectations or fails to meet expectations.
Your feedback will be scored by the recipient as to how helpful it is to the original author of the case
submission.
 Midterm exams: Each of the midterm exams is a 50-minute exam that may consist of multiple
choice, short answer and essay questions. The midterm exams each cover their respective portion of
the course and are not cumulative, however, much of the underlying course material is cumulative.
So, if you fall too far behind, you will be at a disadvantage on the exams. We will post a previous
version of the exam to use as a study guide for your review prior to the exam.
 Final exam: The final exam will last 120 minutes and contain a variety of question types. It is
cumulative. Roughly half of the test content comes from the material covered during the last
portion of the course, and the other half of the test questions will cover materials from the first 3
portions of the semester.
 Class contribution: see the attendance policy in section III.1 above.
 Exit questions: each class period there will be a low stakes question posted that you will need to
answer. This is intended both as a basic skills check, and to ensure that you are paying attention
during class. If you are not able to attend class, you will have 24 hours to watch the recorded
video and answer the exit question. After 24 hours you will no longer be allowed to turn in the
assignment.
 Introductory video: before the first class you must submit a link to a Youtube video that you
create introducing you to the class. Your introductory video, and the responses you post to other
people’s videos will count toward your contribution score for the course. You will post the link
to your video into a discussion board on Questromtools where we will each review the videos
and you will comment on at least 3 other people’s videos. You can critique them, or find
something you share in common with them, or just about any other constructive response to the
video you can think of. The video must be at least 30 seconds and not more than 1 minute. Your
video will be worth 2 points, and your comments in response to other’s videos will each be worth
1 up to 3, for a total of 5 points possible relating to the introductory videos. Your video should
include information such as:
 What is your name?
 What is your year?
 What is your concentration?
 Where you are from?
 What are your passions?
 Why you chose BU?

I. Course Administrative Details
 Coordinator/instructor:II. Course Description, Learning Goals, Structure, & Materials
II.1a. Course Description & Learning Goals
 Introduces the basic principles, methods, and challenges of modern managerial accounting.
Covers traditional topics such as job-order costing, cost-volume-profit analysis, budgeting,
variance analysis, profitability analysis, relevant costs for decision making, and cost-plus pricing,
as well as less traditional topics such as Activity-Based Cost (ABC) accounting and performance
measurement. The material is examined from the perspective of students preparing to use
accounting information as managers, to support decision making (such as pricing, product mix,
sourcing, technology and investment decisions) and short- and long-term planning, and to
measure, evaluate, and reward performance. Emphasizes the relationships between accounting
techniques and other organizational activities. 4 cr.
II.1b. Course Learning Objectives
 Learn terminology to describe, categorize, and analyze the costs of doing business
 Understand how costs behave in relation to changes in volume
 Distinguish between the direct and indirect costs of products and services, and learn benefits
and drawbacks of different methods of allocating indirect costs to the objectives those costs
help to achieve
 Prepare a master budget as well as each of its components and understand how to use it to
manage operations
 Learn to make strategic decisions, using financial and non-financial information
 Gain an understanding of the basics of performance measurement
 Become proficient in variance analysis

AC222 – Managerial Accounting Fall, 2020
II.2. Course Structure & Pedagogy
 Module 1 – Understand cost terms, definitions and concepts relating to the operations of a business.
Understand how those costs behave in relation to changes in volume and the implications of this
relationship on firm risk.
 Module 2 – Managerial analysis, learn a tool set to make better business decisions
 Module 3 – Learn to construct budgets and to use those to control/improve operations
 Module 4 – Learn how to assess the performance of a business
II.3. Course Materials:
III. Managerial Accounting, Davis and Davis, 4th edition. You will need this version, not a
previous, nor an international version. Available at Barnes & Noble or online through
Wiley. This version is bundled with WileyPlus access, which you will need for this course.
A used book will not come with WileyPlus access, so if you buy a used version, you will
need to purchase WileyPlus access separately. If you purchase WileyPlus access by itself,
you receive access to an e-book included in the price
IV. Course Policies
III.1. Attendance Policy and Contribution Score (valid only through exam 1, thereafter attendance
is no longer mandatory, but suggested)
 Attendance is expected and the easiest way to do well in the participation portion of the class. While
attendance alone does NOT ensure a good contribution score, it will be much harder to achieve a
good contribution score without attending class. Arriving on time is expected. Students who arrive
late disrupt the learning process of everyone who made it to class on time. Late arrivals will bear a
penalty to participation. I will not distinguish between “excused or unexcused absences”.
 BU policy and Massachusetts State Law consider absences for religious reasons to be “excused” but
as far as I am aware there are not more than 3 major religious holidays scheduled during this course,
and as such, no one should need to miss more than 3 classes.
 If you are not able to attend the live session of the class, you are expected to watch a video recording
of the lecture. In addition, you will need to participate in the online discussion forums. Failure to
participate in live class sessions as well as not participating in the online discussion forums and not
providing case feedback will be grounds for a 0 in the contribution portion of the class.
III.2. Academic accommodations for students with special needs:
 In keeping with University policy, any student with a disability who needs or thinks they need
academic accommodations must call the Office of Disability Services at 617-353-3658 or stop by 19
Deerfield Street to arrange a confidential appointment with a Disability Services staff member.
Accommodation letters must be delivered to your instructor in a timely fashion (not later than two
weeks before any major examination). Please note that accommodations will not be delivered
absent an official letter of accommodation.
III.3. Academic Integrity Policy
 The Questrom Academic Conduct Code is strictly observed in this course. Consider it to be an
addendum to this syllabus. I assume that if you continue in this course, you have read and
understood the Academic Conduct Code. Penalties for infractions range from a minimum of a zero
grade on the test or assignment, to an appearance before the Academic Conduct Committee, which
could result in suspension or expulsion from Boston University.
III.4. Diversity and Inclusion Statement
 In developing this course, I have aimed to be thoughtful about how identity, abilities, experiences
and culture impact the course content.

 I invite you to share your personal experiences and perspective related to the course content. If there
are topics or conversations that you feel would benefit from incorporation of social context, a
differing perspective, or Questrom’s Office of Diversity & Inclusion, please inform me and I will
explore resources and opportunities for us to engage a wide variety of perspectives in our classroom.
V. Course Evaluation & Expectations
IV.1. Course Evaluation
 Grading: The relative weighting of assignments in your course grade is as follows:
 Evaluation Activity Fraction of Course Grade
Mid-Term Exam #1 20%
Mid-Term Exam #2 20%
Exit Questions 5%
Introductory Video 5%
Final Exam 25%
Class Contribution 5%
Individual WileyPlus homework submissions 5%
Case feedback scores 5%
Case #1 (Ethics Case) 5%
 Case #2 (Variance Analysis or Budgeting Case) 5%
 TOTAL 100%
 There will be absolutely no grade deflation in this course (There will also, however, not be any
grade inflation). Final course grades will be the result of a direct mathematical computation,
based on the formula above and the distribution below.
o Questrom’s grading guidelines for required UG courses:
25-35% of students can expect to receive A’s (for excellent work)
50-65% of students can expect to receive B’s (for good or very good work)
5-20% of students can expect to receive C’s or below (for adequate or poor work)
 If you have any questions about grades that you receive on particular assignments, you must raise
them within two weeks of receiving your grade on that assignment. Unless we have made
computational errors, we will be unable to alter grades after final grades have been determined.
If you have particular grade-related considerations that you think are important, please raise
these with your instructor as early as possible (during the first half of the semester at the latest!),
so that your instructor can help you approach the course in a way that will help you achieve your
best possible performance.
IV.2. Assignment Descriptions & Expectations
 WileyPlus homework: Each chapter in the book has a homework assignment associated with the
online system. Submissions are due one week after the associated material was covered in class. I
suggest you do not fall behind in these assignments as they are meant to be material to reinforce
what we did in lecture each day after completing each class. I will give a full score to anyone who
completes more than 90% of the material correctly. Scores below 90% will be graded as the
reported score multiplied by the number of points possible for the assignment.
 Case submissions: We will cover two cases in this course. The cases are a lot of fun and highly
interactive. Because they are so interactive, they are a great opportunity for you to gain a lot of
contribution points. In order to ensure that everyone comes to class prepared, you will be assigned a
1-page summary level response to a question about the case that will be posted at least one week

To receive a grade for the course, students in CH 172 classes must register for all 4 sections
of this class: Lecture (A1), Discussion (B#), Pre-lab lecture (D1), and Laboratory (C#). Students
in MET CH 174 must register for the Lecture (A1) and a Discussion (B#) section.
Course Materials:
Required Text: Chemistry for Today: General, Organic and Biochemistry, 9th Edition (ISBN:
978-1-337-59823-1). This is the most affordable textbook option that can be offered in the
bookstore, and will be used for both CH 171 and CH 172 courses. The 8th edition is also
suitable, with one warning: back of Chapter questions on which you should be working will be
recommended from the 9th edition. The question sections do not appear to have changed much
between the two editions, but you may want to compare the two texts to ensure you are working
on the correct problems. If you are only taking the CH 172 course, you can also use “Organic
and Biochemistry for Today. Seager and Slabaugh, 8th edition (ISBN: 978-1-133-60514-0). This
text is identical to the 8th edition of the book we are using, but only includes the last 15 chapters.

proteins and nucleotides
iii. Describe the physical and chemical properties that contribute to the structure and function
of key biomolecules in living organisms.
iv. Describe the principles behind and relationships between the central pathways of
metabolism for carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids.
v. Determine patterns in the structures and reactivities of biomolecules associated with their
function in living organisms.
vi. Approach and answer scientific questions related to organic and biochemistry, and learn
how these concepts relate to the life and medical sciences.
Grading and Exam Dates:
Exam 1 Friday, February 22, in class 11 %
Exam 2 Friday, March 29, in class 11 %
Exam 3 Monday, April 29, in class 11 %
Final Exam Tuesday, May 7, 9 – 11am 22 %
Quizzes, Homework & TopHat (each contributes equally) 20 %
Laboratory 25 %
The final and midterm exams are graded on a 100 percent basis and scaled to a 75 percent
class median by adding a maximum of 15 points to everybody’s raw scores. No points are
added if the class median is higher than 75 points. Only 15 points are added if the class median
is lower than 60 points.
Lecture Format, Preparation and Attendance:
CH172 consists of three hours of lectures per week, one hour of discussion, one hour of prelab lecture, and three hours of laboratory work. Your grade will be based on your performance
and contributions in all three aspects of the course. It is highly recommended that you attend
all lecture, discussion, and laboratory sessions. Announcements, which will be posted both in

The lecture will start promptly at 10:10 AM. There is a great deal of material to cover and we
cannot afford using the first five minutes of each class to get everyone settled. In addition,
important information about up-coming examinations and other matters are often made at the
start of the lecture. For these reasons it is important that you are in your seat and ready to
begin at 10:10 AM.
Although attendance will not be graded, students are expected to attend all lectures. It is
strongly recommended that you read the relevant portions of the textbook before coming to
class. The majority of the time in lecture will be spent selectively explaining the more
challenging parts of the material and their chemical implications, rather than just regurgitating
the textbook. It’s therefore essential that you have a basic knowledge of the material, from
reading the textbook, before coming to the lecture. This approach will allow us to be efficient in
spending most of our class time discussing the more challenging concepts, and on trying to
achieve a deeper understanding of the material. It will also leave more time for us to have
discussions around student’s questions in lecture. Materials in the assigned readings and
materials presented in lectures may appear on quizzes or exams. Pop quizzes may be given
during lecture.
TopHat:
The TopHat audience response system will be used both in and outside of lecture, and will
sometimes be used for quizzes. Your final TopHat grade will be based both upon participation
and the number of correct answers. For in-class questions, you will generally receive 4/5th of
a point for submitting any answer and an additional 1/5th of a point for submitting the correct
answer. Questions used only for information or discussion purposes will earn you 1 point,
regardless of your answer. You will receive a point for quiz questions only if your answer is
correct. You must be in class to answer in-class TopHat questions. Answering in-class
questions from another location will result in you loosing the points for that day, and potentially
obtaining an overall TopHat grade of zero.
For homework questions, you will receive a 1/2 point for submitting any answer and an
additional 1/2 point for submitting the correct answer. Homework questions can be answered
from off-campus.
To receive full credit, you only need to get 90% of the TopHat points, so you can still earn full
credit with a number of incorrect answers and with excused absences. The grade will be
calculated using: [5% x points earned/(possible points * 0.9)].
Online homework:
One or more homework sets will be assigned for each Chapter covered through the Sapling
homework system. Students are expected to check the site after each lecture, to complete the
assignment before the due date, and to leave enough time to manage any computer or network
errors that might arise. Any score greater than 85% will receive full credit for the homework.
Practice Problems:
Students are expected to work assigned end of chapter problems. While these problems will
not be collected or graded, they provide good preparation for quizzes and exams.

Discussion Sections:
Attendance at your discussion section is expected. Students should come to their Discussion
section with questions about the practice problems, assigned reading, and lecture material.
During discussion, Learning Assistants (LAs) will assist the discussion leaders in facilitating
practice problem-solving and addressing student questions.
Students should attend the discussion section for which they are registered. If discussion is
cancelled due to a school holiday, accommodations will be made. Graded exams will be
returned during discussion in the week following the exam.
Quizzes:
Quizzes will be given throughout the semester, at the beginning of many discussion sections.
Students who arrive late will not be given extra time to take the quiz, and will not be
allowed to take it at a later time than the other students. Quizzes will cover materials from
the previous discussion.
If you have a planned, excused absence (e.g. religious observance, BU athletic team trip), you
must submit a written request as soon as possible (minimum: 1 week in advance) to both your
discussion leader and Dr. Szymczyna, so that appropriate arrangements can be made. No
make-up quizzes will be given for unexcused absences, which will result in a quiz grade of
zero. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
Exams:
In-class exams will be administered during the regular lecture period on the following days:
February 22, March 29 and April 29. Examinations 2 and 3 will focus on materials covered
since the prior exam. If you have a planned, excused absence (e.g. religious observance, BU
athletic team trip), Dr. Szymczyna must be provided with a written request as soon as possible
(1 week in advance, minimum), and appropriate arrangements will be made. Unexcused
absences will result in a grade of zero for the exam. If an unplanned emergency (that
qualifies as an excused absence) arises, please contact Dr. Szymczyna as soon as possible
so that any necessary arrangements can be made.
If you believe your test/exam has not been graded correctly, a written re-evaluation request
may be submitted. All re-grade requests must be submitted to your discussion leader before
the end of the discussion period during which the exams are returned. Requests must be
submitted in writing, on a separate sheet, with a clear explanation of your concerns. Exams
that have been written on outside of the exam period will not be re-graded. If an exam is
submitted for re-grading, the entire exam (not just the problem in question) may be re-graded.
Final Exam:
The final exam is scheduled for Tuesday, May 7, 9 am – 11 am. The final exam is cumulative
and cannot be made-up or excused.
Other Important Dates:
Last day to add classes February 4
Last day to drop classes without a “W” grade February 26
Last day to drop classes with a “W” grade April 5

Withdrawals and Incompletes:
If it is in your best interest to drop CH 172, you will have no record of the course on your
transcript if you drop before on or before Tuesday, February 26. You may still drop the course
before Friday, April 5, but you will receive a grade of “W” (“withdrawn”) on your transcript. A
grade of “Incomplete” (I) is given in cases where a student with a good academic standing has
not completed specific work, and cannot be used to avoid receiving a poor grade. A grade of
“Incomplete” is only given in approved exceptional circumstances, as defined in the College of
Arts and Sciences (CAS) Undergraduate Programs Bulletin. Grades of “I” automatically convert
to “F” after one calendar year, if the basis of the Incomplete is not adequately addressed.
Incompletes based on your failing to satisfactorily complete the laboratory portion of the course
are left to the discretion of Dr. Rubio. If you believe that you may receive a “W” or “I” grade,
please see Dr. Szymczyna to discuss your status as soon as possible.
Disability Services:
Any student, whose disabilities fall within the Americans with Disabilities Act, should inform Dr.
Szymczyna as soon as possible of any special needs. Students with learning disabilities should
provide the instructor with a letter from the BU Disability Services office that outlines any
recommended accommodations, at least one week before the first exam. The extra time exam
will begin at 9:55 am on exam days, unless other instructions are provided. It is best if students
requiring extra time on exams are not be enrolled in the Friday morning laboratory section (C3).
Academic Conduct:
As a BU student, a high standard of academic honesty and integrity is expected. Every student
in the College of Arts and Sciences is responsible for understanding the content of Academic
Conduct Code and abiding by its provisions. By attending this class, it is assumed that you
have read and will abide by the Code, which can be found at:
http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/
Please note that we treat cheating - that is any infraction whatsoever of the Academic Conduct
Code - with ZERO TOLERANCE. Cheating is self-destructive, and is disrespectful to your
classmates who earn their grades honestly. At minimum, the consequences of cheating are
that the score for work on which cheating occurs counts as zero and that a letter detailing the
cheating is sent to the student’s advisor, the Dean of your college or program, and placed in
the student’s academic file. Possible further consequences are referral to the Academic
Conduct Committee and additional penalties, including possible expulsion from the University.
None of these consequences are at the discretion of the instructors, but rather are governed
by Boston University’s policies.
Work Together or Work Alone? In light of our strict observance of the Academic Conduct Code,
you may be wondering when it is or is not okay to receive help from a classmate or another
student on an assignment. The simple answer is: if the assignment is for credit (i.e. online
homework, lab report, quiz or exam), then the final written work product MUST reflect YOUR
OWN understanding of the material. In work that is not graded for credit, for example when
doing problems from the textbook, we encourage you to discuss them with your classmates
and within study groups as much as possible, as this is an important mechanism by which you
can come to understand the material better. Thus:

Rules for Taking Examinations: We make every effort to conduct the examinations in a way
that discourages cheating. These precautionary measures include the following:
a) You are permitted to bring to examinations:
• A Scientific Calculator (unless told otherwise). Graphing calculators and PDAs (i.e. palm
pilots, iPhones or similar electronic devices) with a calculator “app” are not permitted
during examinations.
• A beverage in a colorless, transparent bottle with no label.
b) You may not bring to the examination:
• Any notes or other written or printed matter.
• Laptops, cell phones, mp3 players or any other electronic device.
• No wrapped food, including candy.
c) During the exam, you must sit as directed by the supervising faculty and TFs.
d) All personal belongings must be placed out of reach. Once the exam has started, you
may not access your possessions until the exam is over and you are ready to leave.
Make sure you have any permitted articles that you need for the exam prior to beginning.
e) Hats with visors are to be left with your personal belongings or turned backwards.
f) Once you enter the examination room and sit down, there is no talking to other students
or sharing of any materials, such as molecular models and calculators.
g) If you arrive late, you will not be given extra time to complete the exam. You will not be
allowed to take the exam if any student has handed in his or her work and left the room.
h) If you need to talk to me or to one of the other proctors, raise your hand.
i) If you need to go to the restroom, you must notify and may be accompanied by a
proctor.
j) Please do not fidget loudly, tap on the desk, or make other noises that might disrupt the
concentration of your classmates.
k) All other customary rules for taking exams are enforced.
l) Any serious infractions or suspected cheating will be immediately reported to the Dean’s
Office, who will then take the appropriate actions.

FAQ: How Does One Pass Principles of Organic and Biochemistry?
a) Attend every one of your lecture, discussion, pre-lab and laboratory sections!
b) Schedule enough time to learn the materials!!! For each 50 minutes of class time, you
should spend at least 3 hours reviewing/rewriting the materials. Material covered in later
classes is dependent upon the material learned in earlier classes.
• Read the corresponding sections or chapter before class and come to class with
questions and the answers to the TopHat questions.
• Take detailed notes during the lecture
• Rewrite class notes in your own words after class!!!
• Work though many problems every day. The more homework problems you do, the
better you will retain the material and perform on exams.
c) If a concept confuses you, please seek help as soon as possible by asking questions
during lecture, discussion sections or office hours. Later materials often build on earlier
materials, and not keeping up will lead to increased misunderstandings and difficulties.
d) Arrange study groups. Working on problems with your classmates and explaining what
you have learned to them will help solidify the materials in mind.
e) NEVER FALL BEHIND. Since later lectures build on previous lectures, falling even a
few days behind can put you at a disadvantage. Make time each day to work on
mastering course materials. ‘Cramming’ for exams will not be successful.
f) Use tutoring services, such as those offered by the Educational Resource Center (ERC)
or Chemia: The ERC focuses on helping students to become stronger learners through
several free programs and services designed to complement your experience in
class. Professional staff are available to help you craft a customized plan for academic
success and to help you get connected to the wide variety of resources available at
BU. In addition, free Peer Tutoring is available as another support for this course
(subject to availability). For more information on these and other services see
www.bu.edu/erc.
Chemia, the Undergraduate ACS affiliate of chemistry majors at BU, operates a free
tutoring service twice a week. For additional details see their website, Facebook page

in MET CH 174 must register for the Lecture (A1) and a Discussion (B#) section.
Course Materials:
Required Text: Chemistry for Today: General, Organic and Biochemistry, 9th Edition (ISBN:
978-1-337-59823-1). This is the most affordable textbook option that can be offered in the
bookstore, and will be used for both CH 171 and CH 172 courses. The 8th edition is also
suitable, with one warning: back of Chapter questions on which you should be working will be
recommended from the 9th edition. The question sections do not appear to have changed much
between the two editions, but you may want to compare the two texts to ensure you are working
on the correct problems. If you are only taking the CH 172 course, you can also use “Organic
and Biochemistry for Today. Seager and Slabaugh, 8th edition (ISBN: 978-1-133-60514-0). This
text is identical to the 8th edition of the book we are using, but only includes the last 15 chapters.

The lecture will start promptly at 10:10 AM. There is a great deal of material to cover and we
cannot afford using the first five minutes of each class to get everyone settled. In addition,
important information about up-coming examinations and other matters are often made at the
start of the lecture. For these reasons it is important that you are in your seat and ready to
begin at 10:10 AM.
Although attendance will not be graded, students are expected to attend all lectures. It is
strongly recommended that you read the relevant portions of the textbook before coming to
class. The majority of the time in lecture will be spent selectively explaining the more
challenging parts of the material and their chemical implications, rather than just regurgitating
the textbook. It’s therefore essential that you have a basic knowledge of the material, from
reading the textbook, before coming to the lecture. This approach will allow us to be efficient in
spending most of our class time discussing the more challenging concepts, and on trying to
achieve a deeper understanding of the material. It will also leave more time for us to have
discussions around student’s questions in lecture. Materials in the assigned readings and
materials presented in lectures may appear on quizzes or exams. Pop quizzes may be given
during lecture.
TopHat:
The TopHat audience response system will be used both in and outside of lecture, and will
sometimes be used for quizzes. Your final TopHat grade will be based both upon participation
and the number of correct answers. For in-class questions, you will generally receive 4/5th of
a point for submitting any answer and an additional 1/5th of a point for submitting the correct
answer. Questions used only for information or discussion purposes will earn you 1 point,
regardless of your answer. You will receive a point for quiz questions only if your answer is
correct. You must be in class to answer in-class TopHat questions. Answering in-class
questions from another location will result in you loosing the points for that day, and potentially
obtaining an overall TopHat grade of zero.
For homework questions, you will receive a 1/2 point for submitting any answer and an
additional 1/2 point for submitting the correct answer. Homework questions can be answered
from off-campus.
To receive full credit, you only need to get 90% of the TopHat points, so you can still earn full
credit with a number of incorrect answers and with excused absences. The grade will be
calculated using: [5% x points earned/(possible points * 0.9)].
Online homework:
One or more homework sets will be assigned for each Chapter covered through the Sapling
homework system. Students are expected to check the site after each lecture, to complete the
assignment before the due date, and to leave enough time to manage any computer or network
errors that might arise. Any score greater than 85% will receive full credit for the homework.
Practice Problems:
Students are expected to work assigned end of chapter problems. While these problems will
not be collected or graded, they provide good preparation for quizzes and exams.

Discussion Sections:
Attendance at your discussion section is expected. Students should come to their Discussion
section with questions about the practice problems, assigned reading, and lecture material.
During discussion, Learning Assistants (LAs) will assist the discussion leaders in facilitating
practice problem-solving and addressing student questions.
Students should attend the discussion section for which they are registered. If discussion is
cancelled due to a school holiday, accommodations will be made. Graded exams will be
returned during discussion in the week following the exam.
Quizzes:
Quizzes will be given throughout the semester, at the beginning of many discussion sections.
Students who arrive late will not be given extra time to take the quiz, and will not be
allowed to take it at a later time than the other students. Quizzes will cover materials from
the previous discussion.
If you have a planned, excused absence (e.g. religious observance, BU athletic team trip), you
must submit a written request as soon as possible (minimum: 1 week in advance) to both your
discussion leader and so that appropriate arrangements can be made. No
make-up quizzes will be given for unexcused absences, which will result in a quiz grade of
zero. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
Exams:
In-class exams will be administered during the regular lecture period on the following days:
February 22, March 29 and April 29. Examinations 2 and 3 will focus on materials covered
since the prior exam. If you have a planned, excused absence (e.g. religious observance, BU
athletic team trip), must be provided with a written request as soon as possible
(1 week in advance, minimum), and appropriate arrangements will be made. Unexcused
absences will result in a grade of zero for the exam. If an unplanned emergency (that
qualifies as an excused absence) arises, please contact as soon as possible
so that any necessary arrangements can be made.
If you believe your test/exam has not been graded correctly, a written re-evaluation request
may be submitted. All re-grade requests must be submitted to your discussion leader before
the end of the discussion period during which the exams are returned. Requests must be
submitted in writing, on a separate sheet, with a clear explanation of your concerns. Exams
that have been written on outside of the exam period will not be re-graded. If an exam is
submitted for re-grading, the entire exam (not just the problem in question) may be re-graded.
Final Exam:
The final exam is scheduled for Tuesday, May 7, 9 am – 11 am. The final exam is cumulative
and cannot be made-up or excused.
Other Important Dates:
Last day to add classes February 4
Last day to drop classes without a “W” grade February 26

Withdrawals and Incompletes:
If it is in your best interest to drop CH 172, you will have no record of the course on your
transcript if you drop before on or before Tuesday, February 26. You may still drop the course
before Friday, April 5, but you will receive a grade of “W” (“withdrawn”) on your transcript. A
grade of “Incomplete” (I) is given in cases where a student with a good academic standing has
not completed specific work, and cannot be used to avoid receiving a poor grade. A grade of
“Incomplete” is only given in approved exceptional circumstances, as defined in the College of
Arts and Sciences (CAS) Undergraduate Programs Bulletin. Grades of “I” automatically convert
to “F” after one calendar year, if the basis of the Incomplete is not adequately addressed.
Incompletes based on your failing to satisfactorily complete the laboratory portion of the course
are left to the discretion of If you believe that you may receive a “W” or “I” grade,
please see a to discuss your status as soon as possible.
Disability Services:
Any student, whose disabilities fall within the Americans with Disabilities Act, should informas soon as possible of any special needs. Students with learning disabilities should
provide the instructor with a letter from the BU Disability Services office that outlines any
recommended accommodations, at least one week before the first exam. The extra time exam
will begin at 9:55 am on exam days, unless other instructions are provided. It is best if students
requiring extra time on exams are not be enrolled in the Friday morning laboratory section (C3).
Academic Conduct:
As a BU student, a high standard of academic honesty and integrity is expected. Every student
in the College of Arts and Sciences is responsible for understanding the content of Academic
Conduct Code and abiding by its provisions. By attending this class, it is assumed that you
have read and will abide by the Code, which can be found at:
http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/
Please note that we treat cheating - that is any infraction whatsoever of the Academic Conduct
Code - with ZERO TOLERANCE. Cheating is self-destructive, and is disrespectful to your
classmates who earn their grades honestly. At minimum, the consequences of cheating are
that the score for work on which cheating occurs counts as zero and that a letter detailing the
cheating is sent to the student’s advisor, the Dean of your college or program, and placed in
the student’s academic file. Possible further consequences are referral to the Academic
Conduct Committee and additional penalties, including possible expulsion from the University.
None of these consequences are at the discretion of the instructors, but rather are governed
by Boston University’s policies.
Work Together or Work Alone? In light of our strict observance of the Academic Conduct Code,
you may be wondering when it is or is not okay to receive help from a classmate or another
student on an assignment. The simple answer is: if the assignment is for credit (i.e. online
homework, lab report, quiz or exam), then the final written work product MUST reflect YOUR
OWN understanding of the material. In work that is not graded for credit, for example when
doing problems from the textbook, we encourage you to discuss them with your classmates
and within study groups as much as possible, as this is an important mechanism by which you
can come to understand the material better. Thus:

FAQ: How Does One Pass Principles of Organic and Biochemistry?
a) Attend every one of your lecture, discussion, pre-lab and laboratory sections!
b) Schedule enough time to learn the materials!!! For each 50 minutes of class time, you
should spend at least 3 hours reviewing/rewriting the materials. Material covered in later
classes is dependent upon the material learned in earlier classes.
• Read the corresponding sections or chapter before class and come to class with

• Take detailed notes during the lecture
• Rewrite class notes in your own words after class!!!
• Work though many problems every day. The more homework problems you do, the
better you will retain the material and perform on exams.
c) If a concept confuses you, please seek help as soon as possible by asking questions

materials, and not keeping up will lead to increased misunderstandings and difficulties.
d) Arrange study groups. Working on problems with your classmates and explaining what
you have learned to them will help solidify the materials in mind.
e) NEVER FALL BEHIND. Since later lectures build on previous lectures, falling even a

To receive a grade for the course, students in CH 172 classes must register for all 4 sections
of this class: Lecture (A1), Discussion (B#), Pre-lab lecture (D1), and Laboratory (C#). Students
in MET CH 174 must register for the Lecture (A1) and a Discussion (B#) section.
Course Materials:
Required Text: Chemistry for Today: General, Organic and Biochemistry, This is the most affordable textbook option that can be offered in the
bookstore, and will be used for both CH 171 and CH 172 courses. The 8th edition is also
suitable, with one warning: back of Chapter questions on which you should be working will be
recommended from the 9th edition. The question sections do not appear to have changed much
between the two editions, but you may want to compare the two texts to ensure you are working
on the correct problems. If you are only taking the CH 172 course, you can also use “Organic
and Biochemistry for Today. This
text is identical to the 8th edition of the book we are using, but only includes the last 15 chapters.
Required Online Package: Sapling online homework
Required Audience Response System: TopHat (TopHat.com, Join code: 045233)

Course Website and Correspondence:
The course website will be administered through Blackboard Learn (http://learn.bu.edu).
Course announcements and material will be posted on this site and/or sent via students’ BU
email addresses.
Course Description and Objectives:
This course provides a one-semester introduction to organic chemistry and biochemistry. By
the end of the course, you should understand and be able to:
i. Apply the concepts associated with the names, structures, reactivities and reactions of
the major classes of organic compounds and describe their chemical basis
ii. Describe and predict the chemical properties associated with carbohydrates, lipids,
proteins and nucleotides
iii. Describe the physical and chemical properties that contribute to the structure and function
of key biomolecules in living organisms.
iv. Describe the principles behind and relationships between the central pathways of
metabolism for carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids.
v. Determine patterns in the structures and reactivities of biomolecules associated with their
function in living organisms.
vi. Approach and answer scientific questions related to organic and biochemistry, and learn
how these concepts relate to the life and medical sciences.
Grading and Exam Dates:
Exam 1 Friday, February 22, in class 11 %
Exam 2 Friday, March 29, in class 11 %
Exam 3 Monday, April 29, in class 11 %
Final Exam Tuesday, May 7, 9 – 11am 22 %
Quizzes, Homework & TopHat (each contributes equally) 20 %
Laboratory 25 %
The final and midterm exams are graded on a 100 percent basis and scaled to a 75 percent
class median by adding a maximum of 15 points to everybody’s raw scores. No points are
added if the class median is higher than 75 points. Only 15 points are added if the class median
is lower than 60 points.
Lecture Format, Preparation and Attendance:
CH172 consists of three hours of lectures per week, one hour of discussion, one hour of prelab lecture, and three hours of laboratory work. Your grade will be based on your performance
and contributions in all three aspects of the course. It is highly recommended that you attend
all lecture, discussion, and laboratory sessions. Announcements, which will be posted both in
lecture and on the course Blackboard Learn site, will include reading assignments, problems
and/or worksheets.

The lecture will start promptly at 10:10 AM. There is a great deal of material to cover and we
cannot afford using the first five minutes of each class to get everyone settled. In addition,
important information about up-coming examinations and other matters are often made at the
start of the lecture. For these reasons it is important that you are in your seat and ready to
begin at 10:10 AM.
Although attendance will not be graded, students are expected to attend all lectures. It is
strongly recommended that you read the relevant portions of the textbook before coming to
class. The majority of the time in lecture will be spent selectively explaining the more
challenging parts of the material and their chemical implications, rather than just regurgitating
the textbook. It’s therefore essential that you have a basic knowledge of the material, from
reading the textbook, before coming to the lecture. This approach will allow us to be efficient in
spending most of our class time discussing the more challenging concepts, and on trying to
achieve a deeper understanding of the material. It will also leave more time for us to have
discussions around student’s questions in lecture. Materials in the assigned readings and
materials presented in lectures may appear on quizzes or exams. Pop quizzes may be given
during lecture.
TopHat:
The TopHat audience response system will be used both in and outside of lecture, and will
sometimes be used for quizzes. Your final TopHat grade will be based both upon participation
and the number of correct answers. For in-class questions, you will generally receive 4/5th of
a point for submitting any answer and an additional 1/5th of a point for submitting the correct
answer. Questions used only for information or discussion purposes will earn you 1 point,
regardless of your answer. You will receive a point for quiz questions only if your answer is
correct. You must be in class to answer in-class TopHat questions. Answering in-class
questions from another location will result in you loosing the points for that day, and potentially
obtaining an overall TopHat grade of zero.
For homework questions, you will receive a 1/2 point for submitting any answer and an
additional 1/2 point for submitting the correct answer. Homework questions can be answered
from off-campus.
To receive full credit, you only need to get 90% of the TopHat points, so you can still earn full
credit with a number of incorrect answers and with excused absences. The grade will be
calculated using: [5% x points earned/(possible points * 0.9)].
Online homework:
One or more homework sets will be assigned for each Chapter covered through the Sapling
homework system. Students are expected to check the site after each lecture, to complete the
assignment before the due date, and to leave enough time to manage any computer or network
errors that might arise. Any score greater than 85% will receive full credit for the homework.
Practice Problems:
Students are expected to work assigned end of chapter problems. While these problems will
not be collected or graded, they provide good preparation for quizzes and exams.



4
Discussion Sections:
Attendance at your discussion section is expected. Students should come to their Discussion
section with questions about the practice problems, assigned reading, and lecture material.
During discussion, Learning Assistants (LAs) will assist the discussion leaders in facilitating
practice problem-solving and addressing student questions.
Students should attend the discussion section for which they are registered. If discussion is
cancelled due to a school holiday, accommodations will be made. Graded exams will be
returned during discussion in the week following the exam.
Quizzes:
Quizzes will be given throughout the semester, at the beginning of many discussion sections.
Students who arrive late will not be given extra time to take the quiz, and will not be
allowed to take it at a later time than the other students. Quizzes will cover materials from
the previous discussion.
If you have a planned, excused absence (e.g. religious observance, BU athletic team trip), you
must submit a written request as soon as possible (minimum: 1 week in advance) to both your
discussion leader and so that appropriate arrangements can be made. No
make-up quizzes will be given for unexcused absences, which will result in a quiz grade of
zero. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
Exams:
In-class exams will be administered during the regular lecture period on the following days:
February 22, March 29 and April 29. Examinations 2 and 3 will focus on materials covered
since the prior exam. If you have a planned, excused absence (e.g. religious observance, BU
athletic team trip), must be provided with a written request as soon as possible
(1 week in advance, minimum), and appropriate arrangements will be made. Unexcused
absences will result in a grade of zero for the exam. If an unplanned emergency (that
qualifies as an excused absence) arises, please contact as soon as possible
so that any necessary arrangements can be made.
If you believe your test/exam has not been graded correctly, a written re-evaluation request
may be submitted. All re-grade requests must be submitted to your discussion leader before
the end of the discussion period during which the exams are returned. Requests must be
submitted in writing, on a separate sheet, with a clear explanation of your concerns. Exams
that have been written on outside of the exam period will not be re-graded. If an exam is
submitted for re-grading, the entire exam (not just the problem in question) may be re-graded.
Final Exam:
The final exam is scheduled for Tuesday, May 7, 9 am – 11 am. The final exam is cumulative
and cannot be made-up or excused.
Other Important Dates:
Last day to add classes February 4
Last day to drop classes without a “W” grade February 26
Last day to drop classes with a “W” grade April 5



5
Withdrawals and Incompletes:
If it is in your best interest to drop CH 172, you will have no record of the course on your
transcript if you drop before on or before Tuesday, February 26. You may still drop the course
before Friday, April 5, but you will receive a grade of “W” (“withdrawn”) on your transcript. A
grade of “Incomplete” (I) is given in cases where a student with a good academic standing has
not completed specific work, and cannot be used to avoid receiving a poor grade. A grade of
“Incomplete” is only given in approved exceptional circumstances, as defined in the College of
Arts and Sciences (CAS) Undergraduate Programs Bulletin. Grades of “I” automatically convert
to “F” after one calendar year, if the basis of the Incomplete is not adequately addressed.
Incompletes based on your failing to satisfactorily complete the laboratory portion of the course
are left to the discretion of If you believe that you may receive a “W” or “I” grade,
please see a to discuss your status as soon as possible.
Disability Services:
Any student, whose disabilities fall within the Americans with Disabilities Act, should informas soon as possible of any special needs. Students with learning disabilities should
provide the instructor with a letter from the BU Disability Services office that outlines any
recommended accommodations, at least one week before the first exam. The extra time exam
will begin at 9:55 am on exam days, unless other instructions are provided. It is best if students
requiring extra time on exams are not be enrolled in the Friday morning laboratory section (C3).
Academic Conduct:
As a BU student, a high standard of academic honesty and integrity is expected. Every student
in the College of Arts and Sciences is responsible for understanding the content of Academic
Conduct Code and abiding by its provisions. By attending this class, it is assumed that you
have read and will abide by the Code, which can be found at:

Please note that we treat cheating - that is any infraction whatsoever of the Academic Conduct
Code - with ZERO TOLERANCE. Cheating is self-destructive, and is disrespectful to your
classmates who earn their grades honestly. At minimum, the consequences of cheating are
that the score for work on which cheating occurs counts as zero and that a letter detailing the
cheating is sent to the student’s advisor, the Dean of your college or program, and placed in
the student’s academic file. Possible further consequences are referral to the Academic
Conduct Committee and additional penalties, including possible expulsion from the University.
None of these consequences are at the discretion of the instructors, but rather are governed
by Boston University’s policies.
Work Together or Work Alone? In light of our strict observance of the Academic Conduct Code,
you may be wondering when it is or is not okay to receive help from a classmate or another
student on an assignment. The simple answer is: if the assignment is for credit (i.e. online
homework, lab report, quiz or exam), then the final written work product MUST reflect YOUR
OWN understanding of the material. In work that is not graded for credit, for example when
doing problems from the textbook, we encourage you to discuss them with your classmates
and within study groups as much as possible, as this is an important mechanism by which you
can come to understand the material better. Thus:



6
- It is okay, and strongly encouraged, to help each other with textbook problems.
- It is okay, and encouraged, to discuss with another student how to approach a certain type
of problem that you encounter in lecture or in lab.
- It is okay, and encouraged, help each other to review for quizzes and exams.
- It is NOT okay to communicate or collaborate with another student in any way during an
actual quiz or exam (see below for additional rules for taking exams)
- It is NOT okay to submit a lab report containing any section that you did not write entirely
by yourself.
- It is NOT okay to share any part of your lab report with another student before submission,
e.g. “just to see if we came to the same conclusions”.
Rules for Taking Examinations: We make every effort to conduct the examinations in a way
that discourages cheating. These precautionary measures include the following:
a) You are permitted to bring to examinations:
• A Scientific Calculator (unless told otherwise). Graphing calculators and PDAs (i.e. palm
pilots, iPhones or similar electronic devices) with a calculator “app” are not permitted
during examinations.
• A beverage in a colorless, transparent bottle with no label.
b) You may not bring to the examination:
• Any notes or other written or printed matter.
• Laptops, cell phones, mp3 players or any other electronic device.
• No wrapped food, including candy.
c) During the exam, you must sit as directed by the supervising faculty and TFs.
d) All personal belongings must be placed out of reach. Once the exam has started, you
may not access your possessions until the exam is over and you are ready to leave.
Make sure you have any permitted articles that you need for the exam prior to beginning.
e) Hats with visors are to be left with your personal belongings or turned backwards.
f) Once you enter the examination room and sit down, there is no talking to other students
or sharing of any materials, such as molecular models and calculators.
g) If you arrive late, you will not be given extra time to complete the exam. You will not be
allowed to take the exam if any student has handed in his or her work and left the room.
h) If you need to talk to me or to one of the other proctors, raise your hand.
i) If you need to go to the restroom, you must notify and may be accompanied by a
proctor.
j) Please do not fidget loudly, tap on the desk, or make other noises that might disrupt the
concentration of your classmates.
k) All other customary rules for taking exams are enforced.
l) Any serious infractions or suspected cheating will be immediately reported to the Dean’s
Office, who will then take the appropriate actions.

FAQ: How Does One Pass Principles of Organic and Biochemistry?
a) Attend every one of your lecture, discussion, pre-lab and laboratory sections!
b) Schedule enough time to learn the materials!!! For each 50 minutes of class time, you
should spend at least 3 hours reviewing/rewriting the materials. Material covered in later
classes is dependent upon the material learned in earlier classes.
• Read the corresponding sections or chapter before class and come to class with
questions and the answers to the TopHat questions.
• Take detailed notes during the lecture
• Rewrite class notes in your own words after class!!!
• Work though many problems every day. The more homework problems you do, the
better you will retain the material and perform on exams.
c) If a concept confuses you, please seek help as soon as possible by asking questions
during lecture, discussion sections or office hours. Later materials often build on earlier
materials, and not keeping up will lead to increased misunderstandings and difficulties.
d) Arrange study groups. Working on problems with your classmates and explaining what
you have learned to them will help solidify the materials in mind.
e) NEVER FALL BEHIND. Since later lectures build on previous lectures, falling even a
few days behind can put you at a disadvantage. Make time each day to work on
mastering course materials. ‘Cramming’ for exams will not be successful.
f) Use tutoring services, such as those offered by the Educational Resource Center (ERC)
or Chemia: The ERC focuses on helping students to become stronger learners through
several free programs and services designed to complement your experience in
class. Professional staff are available to help you craft a customized plan for academic
success and to help you get connected to the wide variety of resources available at
BU. In addition, free Peer Tutoring is available as another support for this course
(subject to availability). For more information on these and other services see

COURSE DESCRIPTION
As social scientists that study the human past, archaeologists rely on field and laboratory methods for
locating, dating, and understanding the material remains of past human activities. We ask questions such
as: Where did we come from? How did cultures adapt to and elaborate on their surroundings? Why do
complex societies rise and fall? What lessons does the past have for us in the present? This course
provides an introduction to archaeological methods, theories, and topics of debate that allow
archaeologists to evaluate these questions and integrate the answers into contemporary society. The
semester builds from the “nuts and bolts” methods that archaeologists rely on in field and laboratory
settings, to the important research topics and theories archaeologists engage in as they endeavor to
explain social change.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
At the conclusion of this course, you will have developed a foundational understanding of archaeological
practice and reasoning. You will be able to evaluate the logic behind and merits of different
interpretations of what occurred in the human past. Through classroom lectures and discussions during
sections, you will gain an appreciation of the deep histories and cultural diversity of different parts of the
globe, and better your understanding of how people create and inhabit an ever-changing material world.
This is an introductory level course that fulfills the social-science distribution for the College of Arts and
Sciences and does not require prerequisites. It fulfills the Department of Archaeology area requirement, and
it satisfies two BU Hub Capacities: Historical Consciousness and Social Inquiry I. Course credit: 4.0.

For the BU Hub capacities, three Historical outcomes will be fulfilled in this course: 1) Students will
develop a foundational understanding of how to evaluate the deep history of humankind. Course content
covers millions of years of human history, including topics such as human evolution, the origins of
agriculture, early urbanism, the invention of writing, and the rise and development of early civilizations
and empires. 2) Students will discuss and demonstrate their understanding of the information presented
in the lectures, sections, and readings, especially in terms of how the human past is relevant in the
present, including the issues of protecting and preserving the cultural heritage worldwide, as well as how
societies in the past have coped with changing environments. 3) Course content includes an
understanding of forms of socio-political organization, from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to the early
states and empires in both the Old and New Worlds. Changing modes of subsistence, especially with the
invention of agriculture, to state-level economies, are also covered. Content includes material
manifestations of social inequality, religious traditions and cosmology and how these were similar or
different during different periods of human history.
One Social outcome will be fulfilled by this course: Students learn and apply archaeological methods of
cross-cultural and diachronic comparison (change over time) to understand subsistence and technology as
well as political and religious systems.
Required Textbooks and Readings – We have two textbooks in this course. First, we’ll be using
Archaeology Essentials: Theories, Methods, and Practice by Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn (2018), 4th edition
(although I will also list assigned readings for the 3rd edition in case that version is more accessible to
you). The second is Death by Theory: A Tale of Mystery and Archaeological Theory by Adrian
Praetzellis (2011). You can buy a copy of both through Boston University’s Barnes & Noble store or
online. Please email me if purchasing either textbook is an obstacle to your success in this class so that we
can make the appropriate arrangements. This includes those of you attending class remotely. There will
also be non-textbook readings, podcasts, and videos, all of which will be posted on the course website on
BU Learn (Blackboard): https://learn.bu.edu/
POLICIES
Make-up Exams – Traditionally, none are given except in the case of a documented illness, emergency, or
previously discussed circumstances (see the section on Equity below). However, current circumstances
allow for greater flexibility, so please do be in touch with the Professor.
CAS Academic Misconduct Code – This will be followed in the event that academic misconduct occurs.
Students should refer to the CAS policy on misconduct
(https://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/ ).
Absences & LfA – As you are able to take this course in multiple modes, absences will not be counted for
this course. However, participation will be assessed based on either your lecture/section attendance OR
the completion of discussion questions that are posted on blackboard and reflect material covered in the
lecture/section recordings. Any prolonged absences or extenuating circumstances should be discussed
with Prof. Clarke.
In the Classroom – As a courtesy to the instructor and your fellow students, be on time to class and
refrain from engaging in distracting behavior. As many of you will be joining remotely, please do consider
keeping your video on (not a requirement, but it is nice to teach to people rather than black/blank
screens), muting yourself when not participating in conversation, and being in a place where you can
focus on the course. When you’re attending class in person, you’ll have the option to login to the Zoom
classroom to view the slides up close, utilize the chat/poll functions, and stay connected to your peers.
To prevent audio feedback, I’ll instruct those of us attending in person to turn off our computer audio

systems. We’ll go over more of this in class, but I’ll also direct you to blackboard where I’ve made a
content folder on Zoom etiquette.
Names and Pronouns – Everyone has the right to go by the name and pronouns (e.g. she/her/hers,
he/him/his, they/them/their) that they prefer. You may introduce yourself using whatever name you
wish to use. It would also be good for you all to edit or adjust your Zoom profiles so that they reflect
these identifiers (see links to instructions within the etiquette folder on blackboard).
Accommodations – If you are a student with a disability or believe you might have a disability that requires
accommodations, please contact the Office for Disability Services (ODS) at (617) 353-3658
(http://www.bu.edu/disability/) to coordinate any accommodation requests. I am typically notified by
ODS but would be happy to meet with you directly as well to ensure that the structure of your assessment
will lead to your success in this course. Those of you that are non-native speakers, first generation college
students, or non-traditional students (e.g., caregivers, full-time workers, etc.), please do set aside time to meet
with me so that we may discuss a flexible timeline that enables you to succeed in all your responsibilities.
Communication – Please check your email regularly for course announcements.
EXPECTATIONS
What you can expect from your instructors:
1) Transparency in the way we intend to assess your performance in this course
2) Empathy, respect, and fairness in our treatment of all students
3) An open ear to your ideas, thoughts, complaints, and solutions regarding instruction, course
content, and your assessment.
4) Confidentiality in personnel matters and individual conversations; transparency and consistency
in decision making, and prompt sharing of information as soon as practicable
5) A commitment to justice, equality/equity, and inclusivity in our curriculum, at our university, and

formats. We ask that you respect these codes of conduct for the safety of our community while
also maintaining a level of professionalism in your decorum.
3) Honesty and critique: if we make a decision with which you disagree, please share your concerns
with us. We will be integrating an equity assessment into this course so that we may grow and
confront any biases within our teaching and course content.
4) Academic integrity: we are interested in your thoughts and unique perspectives on the world.
Please lead with your view when approaching your work in this course.
EVALUATION SCHEME
15% Participation – Marks will be assigned in accordance with the level of participation and engagement
with reading materials and class discussions. For those of you that plan to attend asynchronously, you will
need to complete the four discussion questions posted on blackboard for each lecture and section
meeting. These questions will directly relate to the recordings and can be complete while watching this
material.

https://www.coursehero.com/file/102299047/AR-101-Spring-2021-Syllabuspdf/
20% Sections – Sections are an important component of this course because they provide a more
intimate setting for questions, discussion, and lab activities aimed at introducing you to thinking like an
archaeologist. They are also structured so that they prepare you for your exams, which includes short, in
class quizzes. Sections offer you an opportunity to apply methods as well as discuss and debate topics
from lectures in a manner that is consistent with your exams.
20% Midterm Exam #1 – Covering material from the first unit: Archaeological Methods, this exam will
include multiple choice, matching, short answer questions, and short response questions. It will be given
as a take home and open note exam; however, the structure of assessment will emphasize evaluation,
discussion, and critique over recollection and pure memorization. You will have five days to complete
and submit your exam.
20% Midterm Exam #2 – Covering material from the second unit: Archaeology at Work, this exam will
include multiple choice, matching, short answer questions, short response question, and one essay
question. It will be given as a take home and open note exam; however, the structure of questions will
emphasize evaluation, discussion, and critique over recollection and pure memorization. You will have
five days to complete and submit your exam.
25% Cumulative Final Exam – Covering material from all units in this class (a 30% / 30% / 40%
distribution), this exam will include multiple choice, matching, short answer questions, and two essay
questions. It will be given as a take home and open note exam; however, the structure of questions will
emphasize evaluation, discussion, and critique over recollection and pure memorization. You will have
approximately one week to complete and submit your exam.
2–6% Extra Credit – In addition to extra credit questions on your exams, you also have the opportunity
to complete a total of three extra assignments, each worth 2% of your total grade. These options ask that
you engage with archaeology and related topics outside of the classroom, and then produce an engaging
short essay, podcast, or video outcome (See blackboard for examples). Notably, these may be completed
and submitted at any point in the semester.

COURSE INFORMATION
COURSE DESCRIPTION
As social scientists that study the human past, archaeologists rely on field and laboratory methods for
locating, dating, and understanding the material remains of past human activities. We ask questions such
as: Where did we come from? How did cultures adapt to and elaborate on their surroundings? Why do
complex societies rise and fall? What lessons does the past have for us in the present? This course
provides an introduction to archaeological methods, theories, and topics of debate that allow
archaeologists to evaluate these questions and integrate the answers into contemporary society. The
semester builds from the “nuts and bolts” methods that archaeologists rely on in field and laboratory
settings, to the important research topics and theories archaeologists engage in as they endeavor to
explain social change.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
At the conclusion of this course, you will have developed a foundational understanding of archaeological
practice and reasoning. You will be able to evaluate the logic behind and merits of different
interpretations of what occurred in the human past. Through classroom lectures and discussions during
sections, you will gain an appreciation of the deep histories and cultural diversity of different parts of the
globe, and better your understanding of how people create and inhabit an ever-changing material world.
This is an introductory level course that fulfills the social-science distribution for the College of Arts and
Sciences and does not require prerequisites. It fulfills the Department of Archaeology area requirement, and
it satisfies two BU Hub Capacities: Historical Consciousness and Social Inquiry I. Course credit: 4.0.

For the BU Hub capacities, three Historical outcomes will be fulfilled in this course: 1) Students will
develop a foundational understanding of how to evaluate the deep history of humankind. Course content
covers millions of years of human history, including topics such as human evolution, the origins of
agriculture, early urbanism, the invention of writing, and the rise and development of early civilizations
and empires. 2) Students will discuss and demonstrate their understanding of the information presented
in the lectures, sections, and readings, especially in terms of how the human past is relevant in the
present, including the issues of protecting and preserving the cultural heritage worldwide, as well as how
societies in the past have coped with changing environments. 3) Course content includes an
understanding of forms of socio-political organization, from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to the early
states and empires in both the Old and New Worlds. Changing modes of subsistence, especially with the
invention of agriculture, to state-level economies, are also covered. Content includes material
manifestations of social inequality, religious traditions and cosmology and how these were similar or
different during different periods of human history.
One Social outcome will be fulfilled by this course: Students learn and apply archaeological methods of
cross-cultural and diachronic comparison (change over time) to understand subsistence and technology as
well as political and religious systems.
Required Textbooks and Readings – We have two textbooks in this course. First, we’ll be using
Archaeology Essentials: Theories, Methods, and Practice by Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn (2018), 4th edition
(although I will also list assigned readings for the 3rd edition in case that version is more accessible to
you). The second is Death by Theory: A Tale of Mystery and Archaeological Theory by Adrian
Praetzellis (2011). You can buy a copy of both through Boston University’s Barnes & Noble store or
online. Please email me if purchasing either textbook is an obstacle to your success in this class so that we
can make the appropriate arrangements. This includes those of you attending class remotely. There will
also be non-textbook readings, podcasts, and videos, all of which will be posted on the course website on
BU Learn (Blackboard): https://learn.bu.edu/
POLICIES
Make-up Exams – Traditionally, none are given except in the case of a documented illness, emergency, or
previously discussed circumstances (see the section on Equity below). However, current circumstances
allow for greater flexibility, so please do be in touch with the Professor.
CAS Academic Misconduct Code – This will be followed in the event that academic misconduct occurs.
Students should refer to the CAS policy on misconduct
(https://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/ ).
Absences & LfA – As you are able to take this course in multiple modes, absences will not be counted for
this course. However, participation will be assessed based on either your lecture/section attendance OR
the completion of discussion questions that are posted on blackboard and reflect material covered in the
lecture/section recordings. Any prolonged absences or extenuating circumstances should be discussed
with Prof. Clarke.
In the Classroom – As a courtesy to the instructor and your fellow students, be on time to class and
refrain from engaging in distracting behavior. As many of you will be joining remotely, please do consider
keeping your video on (not a requirement, but it is nice to teach to people rather than black/blank
screens), muting yourself when not participating in conversation, and being in a place where you can
focus on the course. When you’re attending class in person, you’ll have the option to login to the Zoom
classroom to view the slides up close, utilize the chat/poll functions, and stay connected to your peers.
To prevent audio feedback, I’ll instruct those of us attending in person to turn off our computer audio

systems. We’ll go over more of this in class, but I’ll also direct you to blackboard where I’ve made a
content folder on Zoom etiquette.
Names and Pronouns – Everyone has the right to go by the name and pronouns (e.g. she/her/hers,
he/him/his, they/them/their) that they prefer. You may introduce yourself using whatever name you
wish to use. It would also be good for you all to edit or adjust your Zoom profiles so that they reflect
these identifiers (see links to instructions within the etiquette folder on blackboard).
Accommodations – If you are a student with a disability or believe you might have a disability that requires
accommodations, please contact the Office for Disability Services (ODS) at (617) 353-3658
(http://www.bu.edu/disability/) to coordinate any accommodation requests. I am typically notified by
ODS but would be happy to meet with you directly as well to ensure that the structure of your assessment
will lead to your success in this course. Those of you that are non-native speakers, first generation college
students, or non-traditional students (e.g., caregivers, full-time workers, etc.), please do set aside time to meet
with me so that we may discuss a flexible timeline that enables you to succeed in all your responsibilities.
Communication – Please check your email regularly for course announcements.

from lectures in a manner that is consistent with your exams.
20% Midterm Exam #1 – Covering material from the first unit: Archaeological Methods, this exam will
include multiple choice, matching, short answer questions, and short response questions. It will be given
as a take home and open note exam; however, the structure of assessment will emphasize evaluation,
discussion, and critique over recollection and pure memorization. You will have five days to complete
and submit your exam.
20% Midterm Exam #2 – Covering material from the second unit: Archaeology at Work, this exam will
include multiple choice, matching, short answer questions, short response question, and one essay
question. It will be given as a take home and open note exam; however, the structure of questions will
emphasize evaluation, discussion, and critique over recollection and pure memorization. You will have
five days to complete and submit your exam.
25% Cumulative Final Exam – Covering material from all units in this class (a 30% / 30% / 40%
distribution), this exam will include multiple choice, matching, short answer questions, and two essay
questions. It will be given as a take home and open note exam; however, the structure of questions will
emphasize evaluation, discussion, and critique over recollection and pure memorization. You will have
approximately one week to complete and submit your exam.
2–6% Extra Credit – In addition to extra credit questions on your exams, you also have the opportunity
to complete a total of three extra assignments, each worth 2% of your total grade. These options ask that
you engage with archaeology and related topics outside of the classroom, and then produce an engaging
short essay, podcast, or video outcome (See blackboard for examples). Notably, these may be completed
and submitted at any point in the semester.

Course Description: This course is an introduction to biological anthropology, the subfield of
anthropology that focuses on human evolutionary history, behavior, and variation. We will cover
the theory of evolution, primate and human evolution, primate behavior, and modern human
variation. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of what it means to be
human.
ANTH 250 Learning Objectives:
1. Understand biological evolution and the processes by which it occurs.
2. Be able to identify what human ancestors looked like, how they acted, and the
evolutionary relationships between them.
3. Understand modern human variation and investigate the causal forces behind this
variation.
4. Gain familiarity with the biology, ecology, and behavior of the various kinds of
nonhuman primates.
Anthropology Program Learning Objectives Met:
1. Understand and appreciate the cultural and physical attributes of major world regions,
key regional issues and linkages between regions, the processes that shape cultural
change and interaction, and international development issues.
2. Demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of human ecology with specific emphasis on the
ecological, demographic, genetic, developmental, and epidemiological dimensions of
modern human adaptations and their evolutionary foundations over time and space.
3. Apply scientific research methodology and design, including the ability to collect,
synthesize, and interpret qualitative and quantitative cultural and ecological data using a
variety of methods including the utilization of geospatial technologies (GIS, remote
sensing, and GPS).
4. Critically analyze issues from multiple perspectives and communicate results effectively.
Diversity Learning Objectives Met:
1. Understand the history of issues related to diversity, social and economic inequities, and
political power in the United States and across the world
2. Analyze the current social, political, artistic, and/or economic lives of historically
marginalized people in the United States and across the world.
3. Analyze the various institutions and structures that create and maintain social, economic,
and political inequality in the United States and across the world; and, identify those that
offer redress for these issues.
4. Define and describe the various issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion in their
respective disciplines.
5. Critically examine their own personal beliefs, attitudes, and biases about historically
marginalized people and cultures in the United States and across the world.

Required Text: Essentials of Physical Anthropology 4th edition by Clark Spencer Larsen.
Additional readings will be distributed electronically.
Classroom Policies: First and foremost, students will respect their instructor and each other. We
are here to learn from each other and in order for us to be most successful in this endeavor we
must feel comfortable in our environment to share and ask questions. Any words or actions that
threaten a comfortable environment will result in removal from the classroom, potentially from
the course if the behavior continues.
Email Policy: As your professor, it is reasonable to expect an email response from me within
24-48 hours of your email and I will try my very best to adhere to this. In terms of assignments,
my rule is as follows. Because this is a virtual course, all assignments will also be turned in
digitally. Technology is notoriously unreliable and therefore, I recommend that you do not wait
until right before the assignment is due to turn it in. Should you have problems turning anything
in, please email me right away so we can sort it out.
Academic Integrity: Students are required to maintain academic integrity throughout this
course. All work must be your own. Consequences for cheating, plagiarism, or facilitation in
another student’s academic misconduct will be a failing grade on that assignment or test. Further
consequences are at the discretion of the instructor and will be based on the severity of the
incident. NO AMOUNT of academic misconduct is acceptable. Be aware of how to cite the work
of others to avoid accidentally committing plagiarism. See the instructor if you have questions on
how to cite or if you need to. Rule of thumb- if you are unsure if you should or not, cite! For
further information https://osrr.calpoly.edu/academic-integrity.
Missed Exam Policy: Make-up exams will only be allowed with a valid excused absence and
must be completed within 1 week of the scheduled date unless prior arrangements are made with
the instructor. It is up to the student to contact the instructor THE DAY OF THE EXAM if an
exam is missed and to arrange a make-up within 1 week of the test date.
Late Assignment Policy: Missed assignments/exams are not accepted late without penalty,
unless the student contacts the instructor about the absence and requests a make-up, given a
sufficient reason for missing class.

Classroom Policies: First and foremost, students will respect their instructor and each other. We
are here to learn from each other and in order for us to be most successful in this endeavor we
must feel comfortable in our environment to share and ask questions. Any words or actions that
threaten a comfortable environment will result in removal from the classroom, potentially from
the course if the behavior continues.
Email Policy: As your professor, it is reasonable to expect an email response from me within
24-48 hours of your email and I will try my very best to adhere to this. In terms of assignments,
my rule is as follows. Because this is a virtual course, all assignments will also be turned in
digitally. Technology is notoriously unreliable and therefore, I recommend that you do not wait
until right before the assignment is due to turn it in. Should you have problems turning anything
in, please email me right away so we can sort it out.
Academic Integrity: Students are required to maintain academic integrity throughout this
course. All work must be your own. Consequences for cheating, plagiarism, or facilitation in
another student’s academic misconduct will be a failing grade on that assignment or test. Further
consequences are at the discretion of the instructor and will be based on the severity of the
incident. NO AMOUNT of academic misconduct is acceptable. Be aware of how to cite the work
of others to avoid accidentally committing plagiarism. See the instructor if you have questions on
how to cite or if you need to. Rule of thumb- if you are unsure if you should or not, cite! For
further information https://osrr.calpoly.edu/academic-integrity.
Missed Exam Policy: Make-up exams will only be allowed with a valid excused absence and
must be completed within 1 week of the scheduled date unless prior arrangements are made with
the instructor. It is up to the student to contact the instructor THE DAY OF THE EXAM if an
exam is missed and to arrange a make-up within 1 week of the test date.
Late Assignment Policy: Missed assignments/exams are not accepted late without penalty,
unless the student contacts the instructor about the absence and requests a make-up, given a
sufficient reason for missing class.

CLASS REQUIREMENTS:
You must complete each assignment and test on time. If you hand in an assignment late, the instructor
reserves the right to not accept the work unless you provide a documented medical excuse (or equivalent).
If late work is accepted, it will be penalized (5% each business day late).
Class Participation: During the quarter, you will be asked to complete unannounced assignments designed to
assess your understanding of course content. At the end of the quarter, you must earn 20 points of credit on
these assignments to receive full credit for class participation. You may be able to earn more than 20 points
and, therefore, will receive extra credit towards your final grade. This is the only extra credit available in the
course.
Exams: There will be a Midterm and a Final Exam based on the concepts from the course. These concepts
can come from the readings, lectures, discussions, assignments, and class activities. The tests will include
multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions. Students are responsible for bringing pencils and 100Q
Zipgrade forms to both exams. If there is cumulative material between the midterm and the final, the
instructor will make it clear what material is going to be cumulative.
Seven Sins of Memory Group Presentation: Students will be randomly assigned to a group of 6 or 7 and
assigned a chapter in the Seven Sins of Memory book. Each group will do an hour-long
presentation/discussion facilitation on their chapter. This should include a reading quiz the group should
give to the class. The group will score these quizzes and return the results to the course instructor by the
following class meeting. Finally, each group member will turn in a self-evaluation regarding what they
contributed to the presentation as well as an evaluation of each group member. Finally, each group needs
to read chapter 8 and include in their presentation how their group’s “sin” might be a virtue.
Seven Sins Quiz Scores: The five best quiz scores (each worth 10 pts) from the Seven Sins of Memory
reading quizzes will be counted toward your grade.
 GRADE CALCULATION:
Learning Assessments:
Assessment Points
Midterm 50 pts
Final Exam 50 pts
Seven Sins of Memory Group Presentation 50 pts
Seven Sins Quiz Scores 50 pts
Class participation 20 pts

You take your total points earned and divide the number by the class total possible. Note: All points will be
rounded to the closest whole point value when determining your final grade ( .5 rounded up; < .4 rounded
down). In percentages your letter grade would be assigned approximately as follows:
A = 93.34-100.0% B = 83.34-86.66% C = 73.34-76.66% D = 63.34-66.66%
A- = 90.00-93.33% B- = 80.00-83.33% C- = 70.00-73.33% D- = 60.00-63.33%
B+ = 86.67-89.99% C+ = 76.67-79.99% D+ = 66.67-69.99% F = 59.99% or below

Class POLICIES:
1) Electronics in the Classroom… Turn off your electronic devices! It is very disruptive if phones or hand-held
devices go off in class, so please show respect to your classmates and instructor and turn them off before
coming in to class. Additionally, laptop computers may ONLY be used in class as a note-taking strategy. Do not
use them for any other reason during class. If you use electronic devices for non-class related purposes, you
may be excused from class and have your grade reduced.
2) Drop Policy… It’s YOUR responsibility! Please be aware that the only time I will drop you is if you fail to
show up for the first week’s class sessions without notification (in which case you are probably not reading
this). I may drop you for excessive absences, but ultimately it is YOUR responsibility to drop the class. Do not
assume that I will drop you… ever. It is your responsibility.
IMPORTANT DATES
September 21 Classes Begin
September 27 Last day to drop classes without receiving a ""W""
October 11 Last day to drop without petition
October 12 First day to withdraw by petition for serious and compelling reason
October 20 Last day to apply online for Fall 2017 graduation
November 10 Holiday - Campus Closed
November 23 - November 24 Holiday - Campus Closed
December 4 - December 8 Final Examinations
3) Class Conduct… Participate in class! Ask questions! (And always respect others). I never mind answering your
questions, and helping you to understand psychology is my JOB (and my pleasure!) –Please feel free to
contribute to the conversations! However, students are responsible for regulating their own conduct and for
respecting the rights and privileges of others.
4) Academic HONESTY…Cheating and other forms of dishonest behavior are destructive to the educational
process for all students, and will not be tolerated in this class. As a result, the following guidelines shall be
followed:
A. Students may not submit work that is not totally their own, and if you are not sure how to
recognize or define plagiarism, please go to the following helpful link to avoid plagiarism
www.plagiarism.org
B. Exams must be taken individually with no assistance of any kind.
If you do not comply with these testing conditions, please drop this class immediately.
Academic dishonesty may result in an “F” on all or part of an assignment and referral to the Dean.
5) Reasonable accommodations are available for those with a documented disability. Please notify me by the end
of the second week of class if you require accommodations. Late notification may delay any accommodations.
All accommodations must be approved by Disabled Student Services (869-3333).
6) Class attendance is strongly recommended because exams will cover material from class meetings and from the
text. Furthermore, you are responsible for all material presented in class, including any changes in the class
schedule (including exam dates). Absenteeism is detrimental to exam performance. I won’t provide handouts
missed because of unexcused absences; your best source of information is a fellow student's notes. Being
absent and borrowing notes is not the equivalent of attending class yourself. Please ask permission to bring
guests to class. Arriving late to class or leaving early is fine as long as it is done quietly and without disturbing
others.
7) Difficulty with the English language. You should have a good working knowledge of English to take this class.
However, if English is not your native language and you want to use a translation dictionary during the exam, or
if English is your native language and you need a dictionary, notify me by the end of the second week of class.

8) Academic Difficulty. If you study the text, take notes in class, work through the assignments, and still feel that
you do not understand the material, or if your exam performance is not up to your expectations, please let me
know. I will try to help you, and I may be able to suggest ways to improve your retention of the material in this
course. Some suggestions will also be offered in class, but I may be able to offer some advice unique to your
situation.
9) COME SEE ME IF YOU ARE HAVING ANY PROBLEMS!
 Don’t wait too long to come speak with me, email me, or discuss any difficulty. I am here to help!
Executive Order 1083:
Please note that there are two executive orders from the CSU’s Office of the Chancellor that limit what information
faculty members are able to keep confidential. These are Executive Order 1096 (which relates to reporting of
campus sexual assaults) and Executive Order 1083 (which relates to mandatory reporting of child abuse). What this
means is that CSU faculty members are what is called “mandatory reporters,” which means that once we are
apprised of such incidents, we are required to report the incident to our Title IX officer on campus, regardless if the
student wants this information reported or not.
Campus RESOURCES:
There are a wide variety of services that you are entitled to as tuition-paying students at Cal Poly Pomona. Some of
them may be important to you as they relate to this course.
Academic and Psychological Counseling:
https://www.cpp.edu/~healthcounseling/counseling/index.shtml
Counseling services at CPP exist to help students with their academic, career, and personal concerns. The counseling
faculty helps students clarify their needs, make decisions, set goals, and deal effectively with personal obstacles. The
relationship between student and counselor is confidential. They offer academic planning, career exploration, and
personal counseling.
Health and Wellness Center:
https://www.cpp.edu/~healthcounseling/health/index.shtml Health and Wellness Center offers free medical services
to any student who has paid their health fee and is currently attending classes. These include psychological services,
which are provided by counseling interns under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Services provided

https://www.coursehero.com/file/27719994/PSY335-Syllabus-Fall-20171docx/
CLASS REQUIREMENTS:
You must complete each assignment and test on time. If you hand in an assignment late, the instructor
reserves the right to not accept the work unless you provide a documented medical excuse (or equivalent).
If late work is accepted, it will be penalized (5% each business day late).
Class Participation: During the quarter, you will be asked to complete unannounced assignments designed to
assess your understanding of course content. At the end of the quarter, you must earn 20 points of credit on
these assignments to receive full credit for class participation. You may be able to earn more than 20 points
and, therefore, will receive extra credit towards your final grade. This is the only extra credit available in the
course.
Exams: There will be a Midterm and a Final Exam based on the concepts from the course. These concepts
can come from the readings, lectures, discussions, assignments, and class activities. The tests will include
multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions. Students are responsible for bringing pencils and 100Q
Zipgrade forms to both exams. If there is cumulative material between the midterm and the final, the
instructor will make it clear what material is going to be cumulative.
Seven Sins of Memory Group Presentation: Students will be randomly assigned to a group of 6 or 7 and
assigned a chapter in the Seven Sins of Memory book. Each group will do an hour-long
presentation/discussion facilitation on their chapter. This should include a reading quiz the group should
give to the class. The group will score these quizzes and return the results to the course instructor by the
following class meeting. Finally, each group member will turn in a self-evaluation regarding what they
contributed to the presentation as well as an evaluation of each group member. Finally, each group needs
to read chapter 8 and include in their presentation how their group’s “sin” might be a virtue.
Seven Sins Quiz Scores: The five best quiz scores (each worth 10 pts) from the Seven Sins of Memory
reading quizzes will be counted toward your grade.
 GRADE CALCULATION:
Learning Assessments:
Assessment Points
Midterm 50 pts
Final Exam 50 pts
Seven Sins of Memory Group Presentation 50 pts
Seven Sins Quiz Scores 50 pts
Class participation 20 pts

You take your total points earned and divide the number by the class total possible. Note: All points will be
rounded to the closest whole point value when determining your final grade ( .5 rounded up; < .4 rounded
down). In percentages your letter grade would be assigned approximately as follows:
A = 93.34-100.0% B = 83.34-86.66% C = 73.34-76.66% D = 63.34-66.66%
A- = 90.00-93.33% B- = 80.00-83.33% C- = 70.00-73.33% D- = 60.00-63.33%
B+ = 86.67-89.99% C+ = 76.67-79.99% D+ = 66.67-69.99% F = 59.99% or below

Class POLICIES:
1) Electronics in the Classroom… Turn off your electronic devices! It is very disruptive if phones or hand-held
devices go off in class, so please show respect to your classmates and instructor and turn them off before
coming in to class. Additionally, laptop computers may ONLY be used in class as a note-taking strategy. Do not
use them for any other reason during class. If you use electronic devices for non-class related purposes, you
may be excused from class and have your grade reduced.
2) Drop Policy… It’s YOUR responsibility! Please be aware that the only time I will drop you is if you fail to
show up for the first week’s class sessions without notification (in which case you are probably not reading
this). I may drop you for excessive absences, but ultimately it is YOUR responsibility to drop the class. Do not
assume that I will drop you… ever. It is your responsibility.
IMPORTANT DATES
September 21 Classes Begin
September 27 Last day to drop classes without receiving a ""W""
October 11 Last day to drop without petition
October 12 First day to withdraw by petition for serious and compelling reason
October 20 Last day to apply online for Fall 2017 graduation
November 10 Holiday - Campus Closed
November 23 - November 24 Holiday - Campus Closed
December 4 - December 8 Final Examinations
3) Class Conduct… Participate in class! Ask questions! (And always respect others). I never mind answering your
questions, and helping you to understand psychology is my JOB (and my pleasure!) –Please feel free to
contribute to the conversations! However, students are responsible for regulating their own conduct and for
respecting the rights and privileges of others.
4) Academic HONESTY…Cheating and other forms of dishonest behavior are destructive to the educational
process for all students, and will not be tolerated in this class. As a result, the following guidelines shall be
followed:
A. Students may not submit work that is not totally their own, and if you are not sure how to
recognize or define plagiarism, please go to the following helpful link to avoid plagiarism
www.plagiarism.org
B. Exams must be taken individually with no assistance of any kind.
If you do not comply with these testing conditions, please drop this class immediately.
Academic dishonesty may result in an “F” on all or part of an assignment and referral to the Dean.
5) Reasonable accommodations are available for those with a documented disability. Please notify me by the end
of the second week of class if you require accommodations. Late notification may delay any accommodations.
All accommodations must be approved by Disabled Student Services (869-3333).
6) Class attendance is strongly recommended because exams will cover material from class meetings and from the
text. Furthermore, you are responsible for all material presented in class, including any changes in the class
schedule (including exam dates). Absenteeism is detrimental to exam performance. I won’t provide handouts
missed because of unexcused absences; your best source of information is a fellow student's notes. Being
absent and borrowing notes is not the equivalent of attending class yourself. Please ask permission to bring
guests to class. Arriving late to class or leaving early is fine as long as it is done quietly and without disturbing
others.
7) Difficulty with the English language. You should have a good working knowledge of English to take this class.
However, if English is not your native language and you want to use a translation dictionary during the exam, or
if English is your native language and you need a dictionary, notify me by the end of the second week of class.

8) Academic Difficulty. If you study the text, take notes in class, work through the assignments, and still feel that
you do not understand the material, or if your exam performance is not up to your expectations, please let me
know. I will try to help you, and I may be able to suggest ways to improve your retention of the material in this
course. Some suggestions will also be offered in class, but I may be able to offer some advice unique to your
situation.
9) COME SEE ME IF YOU ARE HAVING ANY PROBLEMS!
 Don’t wait too long to come speak with me, email me, or discuss any difficulty. I am here to help!
Executive Order 1083:
Please note that there are two executive orders from the CSU’s Office of the Chancellor that limit what information
faculty members are able to keep confidential. These are Executive Order 1096 (which relates to reporting of
campus sexual assaults) and Executive Order 1083 (which relates to mandatory reporting of child abuse). What this
means is that CSU faculty members are what is called “mandatory reporters,” which means that once we are
apprised of such incidents, we are required to report the incident to our Title IX officer on campus, regardless if the
student wants this information reported or not.

Please note that there are two executive orders from the CSU’s Office of the Chancellor that limit what information
faculty members are able to keep confidential. These are Executive Order 1096 (which relates to reporting of
campus sexual assaults) and Executive Order 1083 (which relates to mandatory reporting of child abuse). What this
means is that CSU faculty members are what is called “mandatory reporters,” which means that once we are
apprised of such incidents, we are required to report the incident to our Title IX officer on campus, regardless if the
student wants this information reported or not.

Course description
""And they lived happily ever after."" ""They"" more likely than not got married. As a device of narrative
closure, marriage is ubiquitous, and to sustain interest until the happy event occurs, literary texts often
describe obstacles to nuptial bliss. In this course, we will examine love and the marriage plot under
stress. We will read (and view) texts that question and probe the nature of love, and that complicate,
evade or even thwart the marriage plot.
In doing so, we will have three goals:
1.) to understand the socio-historical conditioning of (what might seem) timeless, natural dynamics of
love, sex, heterosexuality, and marriage;
2.) to examine how different literary forms shape ideas of love and the marriage;
3.) to use the marriage plot as a window through which to view cultural changes in British society and
formal changes in British literature, 1800-present.
More generally, the course offers a survey of some important texts in British literature of the last 200
years, whose often bizarre plots will hopefully prove enjoyable. Some lecture on historical context, a
few in-class screenings of film adaptations, more discussion.
Course requirements
1.Take-home Midterm (100 points): directed topics on Austen or Goethe. 4-5 pp. essay. Due week 5.
2. Take-home Final (100 points): directed topics on texts from weeks 5-10. 4-5 pp. essay. Due during
finals week.
3. Quizzes (100 points). Nine quizzes. Factual in nature, true/false, multiple choice, short answer and
short essay. Will cover the readings for the current week and lectures and discussions of the previous
week. No make-up quizzes given, except on cases of medical and family emergencies.
4. Participation (30 points). Attendance, contributions to class discussions and activities, various
informal writings (study questions, freewrites, etc.). 3 excused absences. One point deducted for each

additional absence. Positive class participation includes doing the reading, contributing regularly and
thoughtfully to class discussions, participating actively in small group work, and asking informed
questions. Negative participation includes lack of preparation, inattention, sleeping, reading the paper,
working on other course assignments, leaving early, text messaging, and disrespecting other members
of the class.

Course description
""And they lived happily ever after."" ""They"" more likely than not got married. As a device of narrative
closure, marriage is ubiquitous, and to sustain interest until the happy event occurs, literary texts often
describe obstacles to nuptial bliss. In this course, we will examine love and the marriage plot under
stress. We will read (and view) texts that question and probe the nature of love, and that complicate,
evade or even thwart the marriage plot.
In doing so, we will have three goals:
1.) to understand the socio-historical conditioning of (what might seem) timeless, natural dynamics of
love, sex, heterosexuality, and marriage;
2.) to examine how different literary forms shape ideas of love and the marriage;
3.) to use the marriage plot as a window through which to view cultural changes in British society and
formal changes in British literature, 1800-present.
More generally, the course offers a survey of some important texts in British literature of the last 200
years, whose often bizarre plots will hopefully prove enjoyable. Some lecture on historical context, a
few in-class screenings of film adaptations, more discussion.
Course requirements
1.Take-home Midterm (100 points): directed topics on Austen or Goethe. 4-5 pp. essay. Due week 5.
2. Take-home Final (100 points): directed topics on texts from weeks 5-10. 4-5 pp. essay. Due during

short essay. Will cover the readings for the current week and lectures and discussions of the previous
week. No make-up quizzes given, except on cases of medical and family emergencies.
4. Participation (30 points). Attendance, contributions to class discussions and activities, various
informal writings (study questions, freewrites, etc.). 3 excused absences. One point deducted for each


additional absence. Positive class participation includes doing the reading, contributing regularly and
thoughtfully to class discussions, participating actively in small group work, and asking informed
questions. Negative participation includes lack of preparation, inattention, sleeping, reading the paper,
working on other course assignments, leaving early, text messaging, and disrespecting other members
of the class.

POLITICAL SCIENCE 112
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
Winter 2014
SYLLABUS
COURSE INFORMATION
Introduction & Description:
We will explore the United States political system, which will be broadly defined as
including the formal institutions of government as well as the ancillary and informal
avenues of power and influence used to shape political outcomes. By the end of the course
you should have available to you the tools necessary to practically evaluate the political
information you receive from media sources, political leaders, friends, and family alike.
Hopefully you will improve your writing and your ability to apply Political Science to
practical problems more generally. As most of my career has been spent working in
government, it is my hope that we can approach this academic subject with the objective of
making it practical and helpful in your future careers.

Evaluation of Learning:
Two In-Class Multiple Choice Mid-Term Exams, 15% each
One Final Exam, 20 %
Bi-Weekly Team Projects, 30%
In-Class quizzes, 20%
Behavioral Expectations:
You should have read all material assigned prior to the week and day when it will be
discussed. You should come prepared to take notes, participate in discussion, and will be
required to treat your colleagues and instructors with respect. One should expect that as
sensitive issues may be raised, emotions might carry one away. At no time will abusive,
threatening or demeaning language be tolerated.
I will come to class prepared to lecture on the topics as scheduled, unless a change has
been made in advance. I will also prepare assignments on schedule, and make every effort
to ensure your work-product is evaluated in an unbiased and timely manner. I will hold
scheduled office hours and be available to meet by appointment; all discussions in office
hours will be confidential except where required by the university. I will respond to all email enquires within twenty-four hours of my receiving them.
Plagiarism:
Plagiarism is using other people’s work without giving them credit. This can include the
following: using a quote without citation, paraphrasing a quote without citation, presenting
the findings, conclusions, or theoretical elements of someone else without citation, using a
friend’s paper, in whole or in part, in your assignments, buying a paper, essay, et cetera,
from any source, and presenting it as your own, “cutting and pasting” from a Wikipedia
article or any other on-line source, copying another student’s work without their
knowledge, or providing your work to someone else with the intent of having that person
fraudulently presenting your work as his or her own. The University has extremely strict
penalties for plagiarism or “cheating,” to include suspension and permanent expulsion
without credit. To protect the legitimate efforts of its students, the Department of Political
Science takes every effort to detect plagiarism and punish those who plagiarize.
Student Resources & Students With Disabilities
Please advise me early on of any special accommodations you require and coordinate these
requests through the Disability Resource Center.

The pace of a ten-week quarter can be stressful. All students have access to professional
counseling free of charge through Health and Counseling Services. You can find
information about their services at:
http://www.hcs.calpoly.edu/content/counseling/counseling-home
Or by calling 805-756-2511, or simply drop in at their offices in Building 27, Room 135,
near the Rec Center.
SCHEDULE OF TOPICS & ASSIGNMENTS:
Below is a schedule of topics with associated reading assignments. You should expect
additional reading to be assigned as the quarter progresses and current events present
opportunities to apply what we have been studying.
“AG” refers to the American Government: Power and Purpose text.
“ED” refers to the Enduring Debate: Classic and Contemporary Readings in American
Politics text.
You’ll find that mostly the chapters of AG and ED are parallel, but don’t make this
assumption. Each chapter in ED is divided into two big sections that contain more than
one article; you can assume that you should concentrate on the first section. The pace of a
ten-week quarter is relentless; it will be easy to fall behind on your reading assignments.
The chapter numbers listed below correspond to the most current edition of these texts.
Older texts are acceptable, please note that there will be a slight difference in the chapter
numbers (usually only off by one) in very recent previous editions.

Pre-Test & Survey

POLITICAL SCIENCE 112
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
Winter 2014
SYLLABUS
COURSE INFORMATION
Introduction & Description:
We will explore the United States political system, which will be broadly defined as
including the formal institutions of government as well as the ancillary and informal
avenues of power and influence used to shape political outcomes. By the end of the course
you should have available to you the tools necessary to practically evaluate the political
information you receive from media sources, political leaders, friends, and family alike.
Hopefully you will improve your writing and your ability to apply Political Science to
practical problems more generally. As most of my career has been spent working in
government, it is my hope that we can approach this academic subject with the objective of
making it practical and helpful in your future careers.

Evaluation of Learning:
Two In-Class Multiple Choice Mid-Term Exams, 15% each
One Final Exam, 20 %
Bi-Weekly Team Projects, 30%
In-Class quizzes, 20%
Behavioral Expectations:
You should have read all material assigned prior to the week and day when it will be
discussed. You should come prepared to take notes, participate in discussion, and will be
required to treat your colleagues and instructors with respect. One should expect that as
sensitive issues may be raised, emotions might carry one away. At no time will abusive,
threatening or demeaning language be tolerated.
I will come to class prepared to lecture on the topics as scheduled, unless a change has
been made in advance. I will also prepare assignments on schedule, and make every effort
to ensure your work-product is evaluated in an unbiased and timely manner. I will hold
scheduled office hours and be available to meet by appointment; all discussions in office
hours will be confidential except where required by the university. I will respond to all email enquires within twenty-four hours of my receiving them.
Plagiarism:
Plagiarism is using other people’s work without giving them credit. This can include the
following: using a quote without citation, paraphrasing a quote without citation, presenting
the findings, conclusions, or theoretical elements of someone else without citation, using a
friend’s paper, in whole or in part, in your assignments, buying a paper, essay, et cetera,
from any source, and presenting it as your own, “cutting and pasting” from a Wikipedia
article or any other on-line source, copying another student’s work without their
knowledge, or providing your work to someone else with the intent of having that person
fraudulently presenting your work as his or her own. The University has extremely strict
penalties for plagiarism or “cheating,” to include suspension and permanent expulsion
without credit. To protect the legitimate efforts of its students, the Department of Political
Science takes every effort to detect plagiarism and punish those who plagiarize.
Student Resources & Students With Disabilities

The pace of a ten-week quarter can be stressful. All students have access to professional
counseling free of charge through Health and Counseling Services. You can find
information about their services at:
http://www.hcs.calpoly.edu/content/counseling/counseling-home
Or by calling 805-756-2511, or simply drop in at their offices in Building 27, Room 135,
near the Rec Center.
SCHEDULE OF TOPICS & ASSIGNMENTS:
Below is a schedule of topics with associated reading assignments. You should expect
additional reading to be assigned as the quarter progresses and current events present
opportunities to apply what we have been studying.
“AG” refers to the American Government: Power and Purpose text.
“ED” refers to the Enduring Debate: Classic and Contemporary Readings in American
Politics text.
You’ll find that mostly the chapters of AG and ED are parallel, but don’t make this
assumption. Each chapter in ED is divided into two big sections that contain more than
one article; you can assume that you should concentrate on the first section. The pace of a
ten-week quarter is relentless; it will be easy to fall behind on your reading assignments.
The chapter numbers listed below correspond to the most current edition of these texts.
Older texts are acceptable, please note that there will be a slight difference in the chapter
numbers (usually only off by one) in very recent previous editions.

plans for business and nonprofit organizations operating in domestic as well as global markets.
Specific objectives include the following:
1. To identify and diagnose marketing problems in a variety of situations and industries, both
domestic, and international, and to apply marketing and strategic market planning concepts,
theories, and techniques to their analysis.
2. To sharpen analytical skills in solving marketing problems by working with quantitative as well
as qualitative data, and by utilizing quantitative tools and computer software for analyzing
decision options.
3. To identify strategic options, evaluate tradeoffs, examine the ethical consequences of
management decisions, and propose defensible recommendations, backed by realistic and
creative implementation plans.

https://www.coursehero.com/file/106172296/Mktstgy-Fall21-Syllabus-1docx/
TOPICS COVERED:
A wide array of managerial decision-making topics is covered by the cases selected for analysis.
Lectures focus on decision-making skills that relate to specific cases. Specific topics include:
market segmentation, market selection, positioning, interpreting marketing research data, sales
forecasting, financial analysis, and formulating strategic and tactical marketing plans for domestic
and international firms in many business sectors.
COMMON BODY OF KNOWLEDGE:
Areas covered include: written communications, oral communications, computer usage,
quantitative analysis, financial reporting, human behavior, global, ethical, political & social, legal
& regulatory, environmental & technological, and demographic diversity.
SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE AREAS:
Students will develop skills in: identifying and analyzing marketing issues, problems, and
challenges that a firm faces; applying behavioral and economic tolls for analysis; developing
feasible marketing strategies, incorporating decisions in selecting markets, managing products and
services, pricing, marketing communications, and distribution; and understanding the integrative
nature of decision making.
METHOD OF INSTRUCTION:
The case method of instruction, which is used throughout the course, depends upon extensive
prior preparation. Analyses of marketing cases are conducted with bb discussions and written
case presentations. A substantial portion of the final grade is assigned for classroom performance.
Consistent classroom participation is required. Quality of participation, rather than quantity, is
more important. Students and groups of students are encouraged to use a management style that
they feel will be most effective for them in the situation in which they find themselves. Students,
in the role of participants, should be completely prepared as if they were on a management team
with other class members.
DO NOT LET ONE ANOTHER DOWN; WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!
The instructor will serve as a resource person to help you, but not to tell you what to do. You
have the opportunity to develop your own style as you must do if you are to learn and succeed.
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:
Students are expected to demonstrate knowledge and proficiency in the use of marketing
management concepts and decision-making tools. Class discussion of cases is a vital part of this
course. Hence, you are expected to be well prepared for the discussion of all cases and to
present your independent analyses and solutions for the marketing problems described. The
classroom performance grade will include the instructor’s evaluation of the student’s contribution
to the goals of the class. It is recognized that this type of evaluation may not commonly be used
in the educational environment. However, it is the one generally used in the business world. Your
supervisor’s opinion of your attitude, cooperation, motivation, and initiative, all of which
contribute to the success of the enterprise in which you are mutually engaged, is generally the
basis of your promotions and salary increases, or both. This subjective judgment will be based on
the aforementioned factors that are under your control.

https://www.coursehero.com/file/106172296/Mktstgy-Fall21-Syllabus-1docx/
ASSIGNMENTS:
Assignment is detailed in the course schedule. Cases and readings are required preparation for
each class. Each student/group is to write an analysis for cases as requested, be prepared to
contribute to the discussion of cases, and be ready to answer questions, take a quiz on your
analysis, or hand in your analysis at unannounced times.
Students will be assigned into groups to prepare cases for write-up.
GRADING:
Final grades (with + or -) will be computed according to the following weights:
Group Case presentations and write-ups (4) 40%
Marketing Simulation 30%
Final exam 30 % __
Total 100%
RETENTION OF STUDENT WORK FOR PORTFOLIOS:
The professor reserves the right to retain for pedagogical reasons the original, or a copy, of a
student’s test, written assignment, paper, video, or similar work (including individual and group
projects) submitted by the student for this class. Students’ names will be deleted from any
retained items.

https://www.coursehero.com/file/106172296/Mktstgy-Fall21-Syllabus-1docx/
TOPICS COVERED:
A wide array of managerial decision-making topics is covered by the cases selected for analysis.
Lectures focus on decision-making skills that relate to specific cases. Specific topics include:
market segmentation, market selection, positioning, interpreting marketing research data, sales
forecasting, financial analysis, and formulating strategic and tactical marketing plans for domestic
and international firms in many business sectors.
COMMON BODY OF KNOWLEDGE:
Areas covered include: written communications, oral communications, computer usage,
quantitative analysis, financial reporting, human behavior, global, ethical, political & social, legal
& regulatory, environmental & technological, and demographic diversity.
SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE AREAS:
Students will develop skills in: identifying and analyzing marketing issues, problems, and
challenges that a firm faces; applying behavioral and economic tolls for analysis; developing
feasible marketing strategies, incorporating decisions in selecting markets, managing products and
services, pricing, marketing communications, and distribution; and understanding the integrative
nature of decision making.
METHOD OF INSTRUCTION:
The case method of instruction, which is used throughout the course, depends upon extensive
prior preparation. Analyses of marketing cases are conducted with bb discussions and written
case presentations. A substantial portion of the final grade is assigned for classroom performance.
Consistent classroom participation is required. Quality of participation, rather than quantity, is
more important. Students and groups of students are encouraged to use a management style that
they feel will be most effective for them in the situation in which they find themselves. Students,
in the role of participants, should be completely prepared as if they were on a management team
with other class members.
DO NOT LET ONE ANOTHER DOWN; WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!
The instructor will serve as a resource person to help you, but not to tell you what to do. You
have the opportunity to develop your own style as you must do if you are to learn and succeed.
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:
Students are expected to demonstrate knowledge and proficiency in the use of marketing
management concepts and decision-making tools. Class discussion of cases is a vital part of this
course. Hence, you are expected to be well prepared for the discussion of all cases and to
present your independent analyses and solutions for the marketing problems described. The
classroom performance grade will include the instructor’s evaluation of the student’s contribution
to the goals of the class. It is recognized that this type of evaluation may not commonly be used
in the educational environment. However, it is the one generally used in the business world. Your
supervisor’s opinion of your attitude, cooperation, motivation, and initiative, all of which
contribute to the success of the enterprise in which you are mutually engaged, is generally the
basis of your promotions and salary increases, or both. This subjective judgment will be based on
the aforementioned factors that are under your control.

each class. Each student/group is to write an analysis for cases as requested, be prepared to
contribute to the discussion of cases, and be ready to answer questions, take a quiz on your
analysis, or hand in your analysis at unannounced times.
Students will be assigned into groups to prepare cases for write-up.
GRADING:
Final grades (with + or -) will be computed according to the following weights:
Group Case presentations and write-ups (4) 40%
Marketing Simulation 30%
Final exam 30 % __
Total 100%

student’s test, written assignment, paper, video, or similar work (including individual and group
projects) submitted by the student for this class. Students’ names will be deleted from any

 Class Meetings
This is a web-based course and there is no face-to-face class meeting scheduled. The
course uses Blackboard Learn as a course management system. Prior to beginning work
in the course, please carefully review the information in this syllabus.
 Course Description
This is an upper-level undergraduate course (successful completion of English 102 and
junior standing) that will focus on the content and structure of program planning and
development, sources of funding, proposal writing and program evaluation. The rationale for
this course is the organizational concern for planning, funding and accountability. Urban
planners, public and nonprofit administrators are expected to identify and solve problems
and to think and act strategically in an increasingly competitive environment. In addition,
planners and nonprofit managers must possess the skills necessary to obtain funding and to
determine the impact of a particular program and/or policy. Students will gain experience and
skills in program design, research, and through the independent development and writing of
a grant proposal.
 Course Objectives
By the conclusion of the course, the student will:
 Understand the program planning process
 Develop a project/program plan
 Understand and apply research principles and methods to needs assessment
and identifying funding sources
 Design an evaluation plan
 Fall 2019

 Relate major trends and issues in public and nonprofit funding to the
allocation decisions of government, corporate, foundation and individual
donors
 Identify and understand key components and practical steps for proposal
preparation
 Demonstrate the skills to plan, research and write a proposal
 Demonstrate familiarity with social, political and institutional change in the
urban environment

General Education Statement:
This course is approved as a General Education 08 course meeting the requirements for Writing
Across the Curriculum (WAC). Skill areas for this class include Writing to Learn and Writing to
Communicate.
Writing Across the Curriculum Criteria
This course also fulfills the Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) requirement. The criteria for
meeting the WAC requirement are:
1. The course requires students to write between 3,000 and 5,000 words (10-14 pages, doublespaced, in 12-point font, with 1” margins) in writing assignments (which may include drafts).
2. Final versions of at least one assignment should total at least 2,000 words (eight pages).
3. The course teaches students writing-to-learn strategies that foster students’ experiences in
learning, and writing-to-communicate strategies that foster students’ respect of readers’
experiences. Whenever possible, planning assignments (e.g. reading logs, pre-writing
strategies) and peer reviews will be included in class assignments.
4. Students will be assigned writing complex enough to require substantive revision for most
students. Students will be given feedback to assist them in preparing subsequent papers or
drafts of papers. This feedback will consist of more than mechanical correction of punctuation
and grammar.
5. The course provides instruction in discipline-appropriate forms of texts, arguments, evidence,
style, audience, and citation. Students will be required to use the American Psychological
Association (APA) style. The CSU Library website lists citation guides including links to the
APA style guide:
http://www.ulib.csuohio.edu/research/vrd/citations.html;
or go to the APA website, http://www.apastyle.org/
6. There will be writing assignments throughout the semester.
7. The course will address the needs of students regarding library competency.
8. In order to receive a C or better in the course, students must write at a satisfactory skill level (C
or better). If the student’s writing is weak, but shows understanding of the course material, the
student may be assigned a D, in which case WAC credit will not be received for the course.

Assignments – Comprehensive instructions for each paper assignment can be
found on Blackboard Learn – Course Content. A brief description follows:
Assignment - Paper 1 (1,000 to 1,250 words or four-five pages)
As a grantseeker how do you frame your story?
What evidence exists that is supportive of your proposal idea or not? Why did you choose the
supporting evidence that you did?
Can you approach the issue/problem in a different way?
The above questions are posed in this assignment. Students will craft a compelling story that
demonstrates knowledge of the nonprofit organization and need for funding using the
concepts in the book, Storytelling for Grantseekers - A Guide to Creative Nonprofit
Fundraising and show why this is relevant to planning, researching and writing a successful
grant proposal.
Assignment - Paper 2 (1,250-1,500 words or five-six pages)
Identifying the Funding Source - Part 1 and Letter of Inquiry- Part 2
Based on lectures, assigned readings, The Foundation Center training, students
will identify potential funders for their proposal idea and answer a series of
questions that will inform the research process and help determine a ""strong
match"" with potential funders or donors. A Letter of Inquiry (LOI) is an initial step in
approaching a foundation or corporation for a grant. Developing the LOI is
excellent preparation for writing the proposal. A LOI should be brief, clear and
interesting.
Final Assignment - (2,000-2,250 words or eight-nine pages)
Proposal
You have chosen a nonprofit organization or a public entity to be the applicant in
submitting a grant request to a government agency, foundation or a corporation.
You have conducted research and identified possible funding sources in
Assignment 2 and prepared a Letter of Inquiry (LOI). The Learning Modules and
Short Answer assignments are the building blocks for writing the proposal. All
elements of a comprehensive proposal are covered in assigned texts and
supplemental readings. Each student will make a brief presentation (using
Discussion Post feature) about his/her completed proposal.

Basis for Grading of Assignments
Written communication is critical to planning and nonprofit practice. Grades for written work
will be made on the basis of logical argument, the quality and quantity of research, depth
and scope of analysis, demonstrated understanding and incorporation of course concepts,
organization, form, correct use of English language and grammar, timeliness and fulfillment
of assignment requirements. Late assignments will not be accepted without prior approval
of the instructor.
Grading Rubric for Criteria
A grading rubric will be utilized to evaluate written assignments. Evaluation of student
papers is based on the following criteria:
Higher Order Concerns
Focus – The hypothesis or main point of your paper needs to be stated clearly at the
beginning of the paper.
 Fall 2019
 Page 6
Development – The research i.e., literature, date, etc. utilized to support your hypothesis.
Specifically, students’ incorporation of quotes, paraphrases, examples, inferences,
reasoning, opinions, and forecasts relative to supporting their hypothesis.
Organization – The organization/structure of the paper. Specifically, is the paper organized
so that the paragraphs proceed from one to another in a logical style using appropriate
transitions? Is the paper well organized? Did the student adhere to the APA style format
suggested for this course?
Lower Order Concerns
Style – Style can be considered in terms of sentence patterns and diction. Are the
sentence patterns varied (preferred) or all the same? Variety in style makes for a far more
interesting read. Is the diction appropriate (wording, choice of words) for an upper level
college assignment? Is the diction appropriate for the discipline?
Mechanics – Refers to the punctuation, spelling, and grammar. Students should make
sure they proofread their paper prior to submission. Points will be deducted for
inappropriate punctuation, improper use of grammar, and misspelled words.
Grades of “I”
The ""I"" grade is given when the work in a course has been generally passing, but when
some specifically required task has not been completed through no fault of the student.
An ""I"" grade can be assigned by the instructor when all three of the following conditions are
met:
1. Student is regularly attending/participating in the class and has the potential to pass
the course;
2. Student has not completed all assignments and has stopped attending/participating
for reasons deemed justified by the instructor; and
3. Student has notified the instructor prior to the end of the grading period.

Academic Misconduct
Plagiarism (copying others work in any form without proper reference and citation),
cheating or any other form of academic misconduct is strictly prohibited and will not be
tolerated. Consequences for academic misconduct are based on university regulations
and are grounds for the grade of ""F"" for the course. Please refer to the Student Handbook
under Academic Regulations (Policy on Academic Misconduct) at the following link:
 https:// www.csuohio.edu/studentlife/student-conduct
If you require additional information regarding plagiarism you may also refer to the Writing

 Page 8
Assignments:
 Short Answer Assignments (SAA) – Short answer format, covering content and
weekly readings. A detailed description of the SAA can be found at the Learning
Module. Submit under “assignments” in Blackboard.
 Paper assignments – Designed to step you through the grantseeking process: the
planning and research processes of gathering information and building a case for
your proposal. A detailed description of each paper assignment can be found at
Course Content and the Learning Module. Submit under “assignments” in
Blackboard.
 Weekly discussions – The weekly Discussion will focus more on grantseeking
issues, including the public problems/policies and will be posted on Blackboard

 Class Meetings
This is a web-based course and there is no face-to-face class meeting scheduled. The
course uses Blackboard Learn as a course management system. Prior to beginning work
in the course, please carefully review the information in this syllabus.
 Course Description
This is an upper-level undergraduate course (successful completion of English 102 and
junior standing) that will focus on the content and structure of program planning and
development, sources of funding, proposal writing and program evaluation. The rationale for
this course is the organizational concern for planning, funding and accountability. Urban
planners, public and nonprofit administrators are expected to identify and solve problems
and to think and act strategically in an increasingly competitive environment. In addition,
planners and nonprofit managers must possess the skills necessary to obtain funding and to
determine the impact of a particular program and/or policy. Students will gain experience and
skills in program design, research, and through the independent development and writing of
a grant proposal.
 Course Objectives
By the conclusion of the course, the student will:
 Understand the program planning process
 Develop a project/program plan
 Understand and apply research principles and methods to needs assessment
and identifying funding sources
 Design an evaluation plan
 Fall 2019
 Page 2
 Relate major trends and issues in public and nonprofit funding to the
allocation decisions of government, corporate, foundation and individual
donors
 Identify and understand key components and practical steps for proposal
preparation
 Demonstrate the skills to plan, research and write a proposal
 Demonstrate familiarity with social, political and institutional change in the
urban environment
 Course Materials
The following assigned texts can be purchased (used books are available) at the CSU
Bookstore. Supplemental readings will be provided online.

General Education Statement:
This course is approved as a General Education 08 course meeting the requirements for Writing
Across the Curriculum (WAC). Skill areas for this class include Writing to Learn and Writing to
Communicate.
Writing Across the Curriculum Criteria
This course also fulfills the Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) requirement. The criteria for
meeting the WAC requirement are:
1. The course requires students to write between 3,000 and 5,000 words (10-14 pages, doublespaced, in 12-point font, with 1” margins) in writing assignments (which may include drafts).
2. Final versions of at least one assignment should total at least 2,000 words (eight pages).
3. The course teaches students writing-to-learn strategies that foster students’ experiences in
learning, and writing-to-communicate strategies that foster students’ respect of readers’
experiences. Whenever possible, planning assignments (e.g. reading logs, pre-writing
strategies) and peer reviews will be included in class assignments.
4. Students will be assigned writing complex enough to require substantive revision for most
students. Students will be given feedback to assist them in preparing subsequent papers or
drafts of papers. This feedback will consist of more than mechanical correction of punctuation
and grammar.
5. The course provides instruction in discipline-appropriate forms of texts, arguments, evidence,
style, audience, and citation. Students will be required to use the American Psychological
Association (APA) style. The CSU Library website lists citation guides including links to the
APA style guide:

or go to the APA website, http://www.apastyle.org/
6. There will be writing assignments throughout the semester.
7. The course will address the needs of students regarding library competency.
8. In order to receive a C or better in the course, students must write at a satisfactory skill level (C
or better). If the student’s writing is weak, but shows understanding of the course material, the
student may be assigned a D, in which case WAC credit will not be received for the course.

Assignments – Comprehensive instructions for each paper assignment can be
found on Blackboard Learn – Course Content. A brief description follows:
Assignment - Paper 1 (1,000 to 1,250 words or four-five pages)
As a grantseeker how do you frame your story?
What evidence exists that is supportive of your proposal idea or not? Why did you choose the
supporting evidence that you did?
Can you approach the issue/problem in a different way?
The above questions are posed in this assignment. Students will craft a compelling story that
demonstrates knowledge of the nonprofit organization and need for funding using the
concepts in the book, Storytelling for Grantseekers - A Guide to Creative Nonprofit
Fundraising and show why this is relevant to planning, researching and writing a successful
grant proposal.
Assignment - Paper 2 (1,250-1,500 words or five-six pages)
Identifying the Funding Source - Part 1 and Letter of Inquiry- Part 2
Based on lectures, assigned readings, The Foundation Center training, students
will identify potential funders for their proposal idea and answer a series of
questions that will inform the research process and help determine a ""strong
match"" with potential funders or donors. A Letter of Inquiry (LOI) is an initial step in
approaching a foundation or corporation for a grant. Developing the LOI is
excellent preparation for writing the proposal. A LOI should be brief, clear and
interesting.
Final Assignment - (2,000-2,250 words or eight-nine pages)
Proposal
You have chosen a nonprofit organization or a public entity to be the applicant in
submitting a grant request to a government agency, foundation or a corporation.
You have conducted research and identified possible funding sources in
Assignment 2 and prepared a Letter of Inquiry (LOI). The Learning Modules and
Short Answer assignments are the building blocks for writing the proposal. All
elements of a comprehensive proposal are covered in assigned texts and
supplemental readings. Each student will make a brief presentation (using
Discussion Post feature) about his/her completed proposal.

Basis for Grading of Assignments
Written communication is critical to planning and nonprofit practice. Grades for written work
will be made on the basis of logical argument, the quality and quantity of research, depth
and scope of analysis, demonstrated understanding and incorporation of course concepts,
organization, form, correct use of English language and grammar, timeliness and fulfillment
of assignment requirements. Late assignments will not be accepted without prior approval
of the instructor.
Grading Rubric for Criteria
A grading rubric will be utilized to evaluate written assignments. Evaluation of student
papers is based on the following criteria:
Higher Order Concerns
Focus – The hypothesis or main point of your paper needs to be stated clearly at the
beginning of the paper.
 Fall 2019
 Page 6
Development – The research i.e., literature, date, etc. utilized to support your hypothesis.
Specifically, students’ incorporation of quotes, paraphrases, examples, inferences,
reasoning, opinions, and forecasts relative to supporting their hypothesis.
Organization – The organization/structure of the paper. Specifically, is the paper organized
so that the paragraphs proceed from one to another in a logical style using appropriate
transitions? Is the paper well organized? Did the student adhere to the APA style format
suggested for this course?
Lower Order Concerns
Style – Style can be considered in terms of sentence patterns and diction. Are the
sentence patterns varied (preferred) or all the same? Variety in style makes for a far more
interesting read. Is the diction appropriate (wording, choice of words) for an upper level
college assignment? Is the diction appropriate for the discipline?
Mechanics – Refers to the punctuation, spelling, and grammar. Students should make
sure they proofread their paper prior to submission. Points will be deducted for
inappropriate punctuation, improper use of grammar, and misspelled words.
Grades of “I”
The ""I"" grade is given when the work in a course has been generally passing, but when
some specifically required task has not been completed through no fault of the student.
An ""I"" grade can be assigned by the instructor when all three of the following conditions are
met:
1. Student is regularly attending/participating in the class and has the potential to pass
the course;
2. Student has not completed all assignments and has stopped attending/participating
for reasons deemed justified by the instructor; and
3. Student has notified the instructor prior to the end of the grading period.

Academic Misconduct
Plagiarism (copying others work in any form without proper reference and citation),
cheating or any other form of academic misconduct is strictly prohibited and will not be
tolerated. Consequences for academic misconduct are based on university regulations
and are grounds for the grade of ""F"" for the course. Please refer to the Student Handbook
under Academic Regulations (Policy on Academic Misconduct) at the following link:

If you require additional information regarding plagiarism you may also refer to the Writing
Centers page on plagiarism, which can be accessed at the following link:

Schell-Barber – GAD 250 – 2
Course Catalog Description: To develop an understanding of the principles of effective communication and to apply them to the solution of
management problems in the form of written reports, memoranda and letters, and oral presentations.
Course Objectives: This course will introduce students to various genres that they will encounter in both their academic and professional
careers. Compositional practices and rhetorical decisions will be discussed in detail so that students are able to produce concise, persuasive
documents such as application cover letters, interoffice memoranda, and project proposals. The course’s emphasis on professional development
encourages students to create material specific to their own interests and pursuits.
Text and Technology (all materials are included in the tuition cost of this course):
• McGuffey, M. E. & Loewy, D. (2023). Essentials of business communication (12th ed.). Cengage.
• Carey, P., Pinard, K. T., Shaffer, A., Shellman, M., & Vodnik, S. (2022) The new perspectives collection for Office 365 and Office 2019
Mindtap. Cengage.
• MindTap (provided with textbook)
• Handouts available on Blackboard.
• Office suite software (e.g., Microsoft Office, OpenOffice, or Google Docs).
Assignments: Three major assignments, periodic reading comprehension, exercises/quizzes midterm exam, and final exam.
Major Assignments
• Unit One: Adapting a Message: Students write a formal letter, an email, and a memo to a variety of audiences that conveys different
aspects of a supply chain issue that directly affects manufacturing at a fictional company.
• Unit Two: Video PowerPoint Presentation: Students will apply the skills they’ve gained from MOS PowerPoint modules 1-4 into a
PowerPoint presentation focused on building professional identity. Students will choose a concept from Chapter 11, Chapter 12,
Chapter 13, or Chapter 14 of the McGuffey & Loewy text for this assignment. The presentation should be specific to student majors or
academic interests, last between 10 and 15 minutes, and incorporate specific PowerPoint skills. More information will be provided with
the Unit Two assignment sheet.
• Unit Three: Collaborative Proposal Project: In small groups, students will write to campus stakeholders a proposal focused on campus
improvement. The proposal should include an introductory background, purpose, and scope; discussion of current conditions of the
problem addressed, definition of the problem, and a discussion of strategies and/or improvements to be implemented; and conclusions
and recommendations for the proposed project. The proposal should have at least 7 academically acceptable sources. Before submitting
the proposal, the group will provide a brief presentation (approximately 10 minutes) of its project to the class. 
Schell-Barber – GAD 250 – 3
As part of the Collaborative Project Proposal, students also will be required to assign participation points to group members. An average
of participation points assigned to each student will be used to come up with individual participation scores. This is the only part of the
project where a different grade will be assigned to all class individuals. Everyone in each group will receive the same grade on the
written proposal and presentation elements of this project. If an evaluation form is not submitted, the student’s participation grade will
be lowered by 10 points.
Grade Breakdown:
Unit One: Adapting a Message: 20%
Unit Two: Video PowerPoint Presentation: 20%
Unit Three: Collaborative Proposal Project: 25%
Quizzes, Homework, & In-class Assignments: 10%

Schell-Barber – GAD 250 – 5
Method of Instruction: This course includes multiple approaches to learning: readings, lectures, discussions, individual and group work, inclass exercises, informal assignments, quizzes, exams, and written and oral projects. Students must be fully prepared for each lesson in order to
succeed in the course; therefore, students should regularly refer to the syllabus and Blackboard to avoid falling behind with the course material.
Readings: The assigned readings are not optional; students are expected to have read the assigned readings before each class and be able to
contribute to each discussion. A student’s lack of preparation will negatively affect the quality of work submitted by the student.
Student Responsibility: Students are responsible for the material they missed during an absence. The instructor will not provide an overview
of the lesson or notes outside of what is available on Blackboard. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students exchange contact
information with a select number of their classmates to remain on top of the material should they be unable to attend class.
Late Policy: For major assignments, a 10% reduction in the grade will be applied for each day an assignment is late. Discussion boards,
reading quizzes, and in-class assignments will never be accepted late. Make-up exams will be awarded on a case-by-case basis.
Collaborative Work: Students will frequently work in pairs or groups. For these activities, students will be graded by the quality of the
finished result rather than their individual contributions; thus, it is the students’ responsibilities to monitor the levels of contribution made by
each team member. If a team member fails to contribute to the project after repeated requests from their partners, their lack of effort should be
noted on the Collaboration Evaluation Sheet assigned with the major collaborative project.
Submission Procedure: With the exception of in-class assignments, all written work must be typed and in an APA-approved font and have
one-inch margins. Unless noted, all assignments must be completed via MindTap or uploaded to their respective folders in Blackboard. The
file must be a Microsoft Word file, PDF, or link to Google Doc (make sure anyone with the link can edit). Note that .pages files cannot
be accessed by the instructor.
Attendance & Participation: Attendance is mandatory and will be tracked via Starfish. Students are permitted four absences for the entire
semester. Please contact me if you have ongoing extenuating circumstances (e.g. CSU athletics, chronic illness, etc.) that may prevent you from
attending class. For every absence after four absences, the student’s final grade will be lowered by 3%.
Tardiness: Students are expected to be in class and on time. Students who arrive ten or more minutes late to class will be counted as tardy.
Three tardies will equal an absence.
Classroom Behavior: Students are expected to contribute regularly during discussions. As such, students are expected to have the material
with them for every class. Additionally, students are expected to demonstrate respect to both the instructor and their fellow classmates. 
Schell-Barber – GAD 250 – 6
Email Etiquette: Students are encouraged to communicate regularly with their instructor. Additionally, this is a business communications
course. Email should be professional, specific, and demonstrate your writing abilities. Also, please be sure to include your name, the course
name, and day and time of course meeting. This will help provide context for your message.
Writing Center: Students are encouraged to visit the Writing Center early and often throughout the semester. For further information or to
schedule an appointment, please refer to the Writing Center’s official page: https://www.csuohio.edu/writing-center/writing-center
Career Development & Exploration: Students are strongly encouraged to engage with the Career Development and Exploration office,
especially for assistance and feedback on their resumes, applications letters, and LinkedIn profiles. For further information or to schedule an
appointment, visit https://www.vikingresources.org.
Student Code of Conduct: Students are expected to behave professionally and with integrity and courtesy at all times. Students are expected
to do their own work unless group work is assigned by the instructor. Academic misconduct, student misconduct, cheating, and plagiarism will
not be tolerated. Violations will be subject to disciplinary action as specified in the CSU Student Conduct Code. A copy of this publication can
be obtained on the web at: https://www.csuohio.edu/sites/default/files/StudentCodeOfConduct.pdf or by contacting the Judicial Affairs Officer
in the Department of Student Life.
Disabilities: Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of
Disability Services at (216) 687-2015. The office is located in MC 147. Accommodations need to be requested in advance.

improvement. The proposal should include an introductory background, purpose, and scope; discussion of current conditions of the
problem addressed, definition of the problem, and a discussion of strategies and/or improvements to be implemented; and conclusions
and recommendations for the proposed project. The proposal should have at least 7 academically acceptable sources. Before submitting
the proposal, the group will provide a brief presentation (approximately 10 minutes) of its project to the class.

of participation points assigned to each student will be used to come up with individual participation scores. This is the only part of the
project where a different grade will be assigned to all class individuals. Everyone in each group will receive the same grade on the

Schell-Barber – GAD 250 – 5
Method of Instruction: This course includes multiple approaches to learning: readings, lectures, discussions, individual and group work, inclass exercises, informal assignments, quizzes, exams, and written and oral projects. Students must be fully prepared for each lesson in order to
succeed in the course; therefore, students should regularly refer to the syllabus and Blackboard to avoid falling behind with the course material.
Readings: The assigned readings are not optional; students are expected to have read the assigned readings before each class and be able to
contribute to each discussion. A student’s lack of preparation will negatively affect the quality of work submitted by the student.
Student Responsibility: Students are responsible for the material they missed during an absence. The instructor will not provide an overview
of the lesson or notes outside of what is available on Blackboard. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students exchange contact
information with a select number of their classmates to remain on top of the material should they be unable to attend class.
Late Policy: For major assignments, a 10% reduction in the grade will be applied for each day an assignment is late. Discussion boards,
reading quizzes, and in-class assignments will never be accepted late. Make-up exams will be awarded on a case-by-case basis.
Collaborative Work: Students will frequently work in pairs or groups. For these activities, students will be graded by the quality of the
finished result rather than their individual contributions; thus, it is the students’ responsibilities to monitor the levels of contribution made by
each team member. If a team member fails to contribute to the project after repeated requests from their partners, their lack of effort should be
noted on the Collaboration Evaluation Sheet assigned with the major collaborative project.
Submission Procedure: With the exception of in-class assignments, all written work must be typed and in an APA-approved font and have
one-inch margins. Unless noted, all assignments must be completed via MindTap or uploaded to their respective folders in Blackboard. The
file must be a Microsoft Word file, PDF, or link to Google Doc (make sure anyone with the link can edit). Note that .pages files cannot
be accessed by the instructor.
Attendance & Participation: Attendance is mandatory and will be tracked via Starfish. Students are permitted four absences for the entire
semester. Please contact me if you have ongoing extenuating circumstances (e.g. CSU athletics, chronic illness, etc.) that may prevent you from
attending class. For every absence after four absences, the student’s final grade will be lowered by 3%.
Tardiness: Students are expected to be in class and on time. Students who arrive ten or more minutes late to class will be counted as tardy.
Three tardies will equal an absence.
Classroom Behavior: Students are expected to contribute regularly during discussions. As such, students are expected to have the material
with them for every class. Additionally, students are expected to demonstrate respect to both the instructor and their fellow classmates. 
Schell-Barber – GAD 250 – 6
Email Etiquette: Students are encouraged to communicate regularly with their instructor. Additionally, this is a business communications
course. Email should be professional, specific, and demonstrate your writing abilities. Also, please be sure to include your name, the course
name, and day and time of course meeting. This will help provide context for your message.
Writing Center: Students are encouraged to visit the Writing Center early and often throughout the semester. For further information or to
schedule an appointment, please refer to the Writing Center’s official page: https://www.csuohio.edu/writing-center/writing-center
Career Development & Exploration: Students are strongly encouraged to engage with the Career Development and Exploration office,
especially for assistance and feedback on their resumes, applications letters, and LinkedIn profiles. For further information or to schedule an
appointment, visit https://www.vikingresources.org.
Student Code of Conduct: Students are expected to behave professionally and with integrity and courtesy at all times. Students are expected
to do their own work unless group work is assigned by the instructor. Academic misconduct, student misconduct, cheating, and plagiarism will
not be tolerated. Violations will be subject to disciplinary action as specified in the CSU Student Conduct Code. A copy of this publication can
be obtained on the web at: https://www.csuohio.edu/sites/default/files/StudentCodeOfConduct.pdf or by contacting the Judicial Affairs Officer
in the Department of Student Life.
Disabilities: Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of
Disability Services at (216) 687-2015. The office is located in MC 147. Accommodations need to be requested in advance.

 – GAD 250 – 5
Method of Instruction: This course includes multiple approaches to learning: readings, lectures, discussions, individual and group work, inclass exercises, informal assignments, quizzes, exams, and written and oral projects. Students must be fully prepared for each lesson in order to
succeed in the course; therefore, students should regularly refer to the syllabus and Blackboard to avoid falling behind with the course material.
Readings: The assigned readings are not optional; students are expected to have read the assigned readings before each class and be able to
contribute to each discussion. A student’s lack of preparation will negatively affect the quality of work submitted by the student.
Student Responsibility: Students are responsible for the material they missed during an absence. The instructor will not provide an overview
of the lesson or notes outside of what is available on Blackboard. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students exchange contact
information with a select number of their classmates to remain on top of the material should they be unable to attend class.
Late Policy: For major assignments, a 10% reduction in the grade will be applied for each day an assignment is late. Discussion boards,
reading quizzes, and in-class assignments will never be accepted late. Make-up exams will be awarded on a case-by-case basis.
Collaborative Work: Students will frequently work in pairs or groups. For these activities, students will be graded by the quality of the
finished result rather than their individual contributions; thus, it is the students’ responsibilities to monitor the levels of contribution made by
each team member. If a team member fails to contribute to the project after repeated requests from their partners, their lack of effort should be
noted on the Collaboration Evaluation Sheet assigned with the major collaborative project.
Submission Procedure: With the exception of in-class assignments, all written work must be typed and in an APA-approved font and have
one-inch margins. Unless noted, all assignments must be completed via MindTap or uploaded to their respective folders in Blackboard. The
file must be a Microsoft Word file, PDF, or link to Google Doc (make sure anyone with the link can edit). Note that .pages files cannot
be accessed by the instructor.
Attendance & Participation: Attendance is mandatory and will be tracked via Starfish. Students are permitted four absences for the entire
semester. Please contact me if you have ongoing extenuating circumstances (e.g. CSU athletics, chronic illness, etc.) that may prevent you from
attending class. For every absence after four absences, the student’s final grade will be lowered by 3%.
Tardiness: Students are expected to be in class and on time. Students who arrive ten or more minutes late to class will be counted as tardy.
Three tardies will equal an absence.
Classroom Behavior: Students are expected to contribute regularly during discussions. As such, students are expected to have the material
with them for every class. Additionally, students are expected to demonstrate respect to both the instructor and their fellow classmates. 
 – GAD 250 – 6
Email Etiquette: Students are encouraged to communicate regularly with their instructor. Additionally, this is a business communications
course. Email should be professional, specific, and demonstrate your writing abilities. Also, please be sure to include your name, the course
name, and day and time of course meeting. This will help provide context for your message.
Writing Center: Students are encouraged to visit the Writing Center early and often throughout the semester. For further information or to
schedule an appointment, please refer to the Writing Center’s official page: 
Career Development & Exploration: Students are strongly encouraged to engage with the Career Development and Exploration office,
especially for assistance and feedback on their resumes, applications letters, and LinkedIn profiles. For further information or to schedule an
appointment, 
Student Code of Conduct: Students are expected to behave professionally and with integrity and courtesy at all times. Students are expected
to do their own work unless group work is assigned by the instructor. Academic misconduct, student misconduct, cheating, and plagiarism will
not be tolerated. Violations will be subject to disciplinary action as specified in the CSU Student Conduct Code. A copy of this publication can
be obtained on the web at: or by contacting the Judicial Affairs Officer
in the Department of Student Life.
Disabilities: Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of
Disability Services at (216) 687-2015. The office is located in MC 147. Accommodations need to be requested in advance.

OBJECTIVES AND PHILOSOPHY
Under deadline conditions in the crucible of New York City, you will learn by doing. You will develop and hone reporting and writing skills over a range of news and feature stories. As you improve your craft, you will delve into substance, such as race, crime, politics. You will sharpen critical thinking, news judgment, street smarts, ethical sensitivity. You will learn teamwork. Your teachers are committed to helping you succeed. However, ultimately, your education is your responsibility. In fact, a good journalist embraces a lifetime of self-directed learning.

ORGANIZATION
You will practice deadline writing in the lab but spend most of your time on the street -- in neighborhoods, on news runs. Think shoe leather and MetroCard. Each of you will cover an ethnically diverse neighborhood, cultivate a neighborhood beat, do enterprise stories off your beat. Think story idea. Other assignments, sometimes off the AP daybook, will take you elsewhere in New York, such as City Hall or Police Plaza. As the course evolves, longer, more complex stories will be assigned, taking several days of work or longer. Those stories will include a substantial profile and an *enterprise project* (which may be linked to your master's project).

CLASS DETAILS
• Your classroom is your newsroom. Tardiness is not tolerated. Always be on time.

• Here's how your week will unfold:

Monday, four-and-a-half hour class day.

9 - 11:30 a.m. Seminar in Room 709C. On occasion,
we have guest speakers or field trips.
11:30 - Noon Break
Noon - 2 p.m. Deadline writing in Room 511C.

Tuesday, street-reporting preparation.
Wednesday, street reporting.

• On Wednesday, while on the street, you will stay in contact with me as if I were your city editor. I will work from my Pulitzer office at Columbia where I have two phone lines. You must call me before noon.

• Stories usually are due at 6 p.m. Wednesday or 9 a.m. Thursday. Be clear about your deadline and be sure to give yourself enough time to pull your story together.

• All assignments must be completed and every deadline must be met. Late stories will NOT be edited. So always turn in something. If time runs out, go with what you've got. Give us your best shot. Only stories can be published, not excuses.

• Your stories will be critiqued in detail by your instructors. Sometimes, your work will be edited by fellow class members. We call it the *CAT-scan.* You will sharpen your editing skills and develop a keener sense of newsroom life and of writing for an audience.

• From time to time, we spot check stories for accuracy - names, facts, quotes. Accuracy is at the heart of credibility.

• In seminars, we share experiences and explore techniques, tactics, ideas, problems. Sometimes we'll have guest speakers. Your participation is essential and will be evaluated.

• Laptop computers shall not be used during the seminar. They distract. And you should practice note-taking. Likewise, during the lab drills you will take notes on paper, not on the computer.

• This syllabus is our flexible road map. Read it. Use it to plan your work. We'll follow the schedule but everything is subject to change because of news developments, shifted assignments and other factors.

• Check your e-mail several times a day. I send frequent messages. We also use e-mail to send reading assignments, share reporting experiences and swap comments.

POLICE RIDES
Students will have a chance to ride in a NYPD patrol car on its tour of duty. Stories cannot be published, but you will do an assignment for class. Official sign-up forms must be filled out early this month so rides can be scheduled promptly. Our ride is tentatively targeted for Friday, Oct. 13. Let me know immediately if that date is a problem. Sign-up details to come.

FIELD TRIPS
We will tour the Manhattan criminal courts. Details to come.

REQUIRED READING
Newspapers:
Reading newspapers daily is crucial. You must read The New York Times and New York Daily News. Pay special attention to *The City* section in the Sunday Times. You should at least scan the New York Post.

RECOMMENDED READING
Books (at Columbia bookstore):
• Melvin Mencher: News Reporting and Writing (McGraw Hill, 10th edition). While not required, the book is an excellent primer and students new to journalism are strongly advised to read it. A copy of Mencher is also on reserve in the Journalism Library.
• The Green Book, a New York government reference book; 2005-2006 edition on order.

Check on availability with the textbook desk at the Columbia bookstore.

Two other important books are provided by Columbia (you should have your own grammar book):
The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual.
William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White: The Elements of Style.

Newspapers and magazines:
You should be familiar with the Wall Street Journal, New York Observer, Newsday, New York magazine, the Village Voice and community weeklies on your beat.

Maps:
Get a free subway map and borough bus maps. Hagstrom's pocket atlas for the five boroughs also is very helpful in a pinch.

GRADING
It's pass/fail. From day one, your work will be measured against the professional standards of major media, with emphasis on accuracy, clarity, focus and flow. If at first you falter, don't despair. A prime goal is steady improvement toward consistent, skillful performance. How well you do in the final weeks is more important than how well you start. There will be no tests, but we'll have a regular quiz on significant news events and AP style (remember: read the papers).

ABSENCES
Attendance is mandatory for all class sessions. Any absence requires notification and a valid explanation
-- just like a real job.

INTEGRITY
Honesty is crucial. Anyone faking quotes, falsifying a story or plagiarizing will risk summary dismissal from the school.

MIDTERM
Sign up for periodic office appointments. However, I also will schedule a one-on-one evaluation at midterm. At that time, file all your written work chronologically in a folder. Bring it to our midterm meeting.

FILING STORIES
Send your stories to your instructors via e-mail as Word attachments. However, within three hours of the deadline, hard copies should also be submitted to Professor Gissler in the blue tray outside his office.

BEWARE: LATE E-MAIL STORIES
DO NOT e-mail your story only a few minutes before the deadline. It can arrive very late. What counts is when we receive the story not when you send it. So file your story early and avoid the e-mail trap.

FORMAT FOR STORIES:
When filing by e-mail, single-space your stories. When submitting a hard copy, double-space your stories. All stories must follow our format. Remember to include a word count and to list significant sources (including phone numbers). At the end of your story, always list three additional story ideas. Otherwise, your assignment is incomplete.

LENGTH OF STORIES
Length will vary with assignment. Clarity, focus and graceful expression are more important than bulk. Most stories will be 500 to 1,000 words. Major pieces will run from 1,500 to 2,500 words. You must honor the assigned length. When a story is too long, the excess portion - zap! - will not be edited. This is an important part of your training.

AP STYLE
Mastery of AP style is very important (and a sign of professionalism).

REWRITING
Stories should be polished and carefully edited before they are turned in. However, don't be surprised if you are asked to rewrite your story (with a new deadline). Be sure to attach the original story to the rewritten one or the latter will be unacceptable.

READINGS
Assigned reading is linked to the upcoming week's theme. Be prepared to discuss key points in the Monday seminar. All handouts must be read.
* * *
COURSE SCHEDULE
We begin in August with an important preparatory program. It is designed to increase your understanding of New York City and sharpen some basic skills. You also will begin to explore your assigned neighborhood, cultivate sources and zero in on issues. You will get the feel of being a street reporter.

After Labor Day, we quicken the pace and move into our regular RW1 schedule. We usually have a weekly theme. However, we're also flexible, especially in the final third of the course. Much depends on the pace of our progress.

Wednesday, street reporting.

• On Wednesday, while on the street, you will stay in contact with me as if I were your city editor. I will work from my Pulitzer office at Columbia where I have two phone lines. You must call me before noon.

• Stories usually are due at 6 p.m. Wednesday or 9 a.m. Thursday. Be clear about your deadline and be sure to give yourself enough time to pull your story together.

• All assignments must be completed and every deadline must be met. Late stories will NOT be edited. So always turn in something. If time runs out, go with what you've got. Give us your best shot. Only stories can be published, not excuses.

• Your stories will be critiqued in detail by your instructors. Sometimes, your work will be edited by fellow class members. We call it the *CAT-scan.* You will sharpen your editing skills and develop a keener sense of newsroom life and of writing for an audience.

• From time to time, we spot check stories for accuracy - names, facts, quotes. Accuracy is at the heart of credibility.

• In seminars, we share experiences and explore techniques, tactics, ideas, problems. Sometimes we'll have guest speakers. Your participation is essential and will be evaluated.

• Laptop computers shall not be used during the seminar. They distract. And you should practice note-taking. Likewise, during the lab drills you will take notes on paper, not on the computer.

• This syllabus is our flexible road map. Read it. Use it to plan your work. We'll follow the schedule but everything is subject to change because of news developments, shifted assignments and other factors.

• Check your e-mail several times a day. I send frequent messages. We also use e-mail to send reading assignments, share reporting experiences and swap comments.

POLICE RIDES
Students will have a chance to ride in a NYPD patrol car on its tour of duty. Stories cannot be published, but you will do an assignment for class. Official sign-up forms must be filled out early this month so rides can be scheduled promptly. Our ride is tentatively targeted for Friday, Oct. 13. Let me know immediately if that date is a problem. Sign-up details to come.

FIELD TRIPS
We will tour the Manhattan criminal courts. Details to come.

REQUIRED READING
Newspapers:
Reading newspapers daily is crucial. You must read The New York Times and New York Daily News. Pay special attention to *The City* section in the Sunday Times. You should at least scan the New York Post.

RECOMMENDED READING
Books (at Columbia bookstore):
• Melvin Mencher: News Reporting and Writing (McGraw Hill, 10th edition). While not required, the book is an excellent primer and students new to journalism are strongly advised to read it. A copy of Mencher is also on reserve in the Journalism Library.
• The Green Book, a New York government reference book; 2005-2006 edition on order.

Check on availability with the textbook desk at the Columbia bookstore.

Two other important books are provided by Columbia (you should have your own grammar book):
The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual.
William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White: The Elements of Style.

Newspapers and magazines:
You should be familiar with the Wall Street Journal, New York Observer, Newsday, New York magazine, the Village Voice and community weeklies on your beat.

Maps:
Get a free subway map and borough bus maps. Hagstrom's pocket atlas for the five boroughs also is very helpful in a pinch.

GRADING
It's pass/fail. From day one, your work will be measured against the professional standards of major media, with emphasis on accuracy, clarity, focus and flow. If at first you falter, don't despair. A prime goal is steady improvement toward consistent, skillful performance. How well you do in the final weeks is more important than how well you start. There will be no tests, but we'll have a regular quiz on significant news events and AP style (remember: read the papers).

ABSENCES
Attendance is mandatory for all class sessions. Any absence requires notification and a valid explanation
-- just like a real job.

INTEGRITY
Honesty is crucial. Anyone faking quotes, falsifying a story or plagiarizing will risk summary dismissal from the school.

MIDTERM
Sign up for periodic office appointments. However, I also will schedule a one-on-one evaluation at midterm. At that time, file all your written work chronologically in a folder. Bring it to our midterm meeting.

FILING STORIES
Send your stories to your instructors via e-mail as Word attachments. However, within three hours of the deadline, hard copies should also be submitted to Professor Gissler in the blue tray outside his office.

BEWARE: LATE E-MAIL STORIES
DO NOT e-mail your story only a few minutes before the deadline. It can arrive very late. What counts is when we receive the story not when you send it. So file your story early and avoid the e-mail trap.

FORMAT FOR STORIES:
When filing by e-mail, single-space your stories. When submitting a hard copy, double-space your stories. All stories must follow our format. Remember to include a word count and to list significant sources (including phone numbers). At the end of your story, always list three additional story ideas. Otherwise, your assignment is incomplete.

LENGTH OF STORIES
Length will vary with assignment. Clarity, focus and graceful expression are more important than bulk. Most stories will be 500 to 1,000 words. Major pieces will run from 1,500 to 2,500 words. You must honor the assigned length. When a story is too long, the excess portion - zap! - will not be edited. This is an important part of your training.

AP STYLE
Mastery of AP style is very important (and a sign of professionalism).

REWRITING
Stories should be polished and carefully edited before they are turned in. However, don't be surprised if you are asked to rewrite your story (with a new deadline). Be sure to attach the original story to the rewritten one or the latter will be unacceptable.

READINGS
Assigned reading is linked to the upcoming week's theme. Be prepared to discuss key points in the Monday seminar. All handouts must be read.
* * *
COURSE SCHEDULE
We begin in August with an important preparatory program. It is designed to increase your understanding of New York City and sharpen some basic skills. You also will begin to explore your assigned neighborhood, cultivate sources and zero in on issues. You will get the feel of being a street reporter.

After Labor Day, we quicken the pace and move into our regular RW1 schedule. We usually have a weekly theme. However, we're also flexible, especially in the final third of the course. Much depends on the pace of our progress.

","REPORTING & WRITING (RWI) J6001X
Columbia University, August 2006

OBJECTIVES AND PHILOSOPHY
Under deadline conditions in the crucible of New York City, you will learn by doing. You will develop and hone reporting and writing skills over a range of news and feature stories. As you improve your craft, you will delve into substance, such as race, crime, politics. You will sharpen critical thinking, news judgment, street smarts, ethical sensitivity. You will learn teamwork. Your teachers are committed to helping you succeed. However, ultimately, your education is your responsibility. In fact, a good journalist embraces a lifetime of self-directed learning.

ORGANIZATION
You will practice deadline writing in the lab but spend most of your time on the street -- in neighborhoods, on news runs. Think shoe leather and MetroCard. Each of you will cover an ethnically diverse neighborhood, cultivate a neighborhood beat, do enterprise stories off your beat. Think story idea. Other assignments, sometimes off the AP daybook, will take you elsewhere in New York, such as City Hall or Police Plaza. As the course evolves, longer, more complex stories will be assigned, taking several days of work or longer. Those stories will include a substantial profile and an *enterprise project* (which may be linked to your master's project).

CLASS DETAILS
• Your classroom is your newsroom. Tardiness is not tolerated. Always be on time.

• Here's how your week will unfold:

Monday, four-and-a-half hour class day.

9 - 11:30 a.m. Seminar in Room 709C. On occasion,
we have guest speakers or field trips.
11:30 - Noon Break
Noon - 2 p.m. Deadline writing in Room 511C.

Tuesday, street-reporting preparation.

COURSE DESCRIPTION AND GOALS
From        the        Core        website:
Lit         Hum,         as         it         is         commonly         known,         is         designed         to         enhance         students’        
understanding         of        main        lines         of        literary        and         philosophical         development         that        
have        shaped        western         thought         for        nearly         three        millennia.        Much        more         than        a        
survey         of         great         books,         Lit         Hum         encourages         students         to         become         critical        
readers        of        the        literary        past        we        have        inherited.        Although        most        of        our        Lit        Hum        
works        (and        the        cultures        they        represent)        are        remote        from        us,        we        nonetheless        
learn        something        about        ourselves        in        struggling        to        appreciate        and        understand        
them.        Lit        Hum        encourages        us        to        compare        our        own        assumptions        and        values        to        
the         radically         different         ones         expressed         in         our         readings.         It         demands         that         we        
examine        ourselves        in        relation        to        our        past.        
This        course        is        an        introduction         to        exemplary literary        and        philosophical texts        of         the        
Western        tradition,        spanning        2,500 years        of        history.        In        our readings        and        discussions
we         will         examine         how         these         works         portray         and         respond         to varieties         of         human        
experience, critique         socio-political         values         and         structures, and         offer us         a        means         by        
which         to         engage past worlds and         clarify         our         own         values. In         our seminar         we         will        
debate        the        issues         these        books         raise,         trace         recurring         themes,        as        well        as pay        special        
attention        to        literary        forms        and their        historical        evolution.                        
This         course         values         the         process         of         learning         as         much         as the         content         we         study.         In        
addition        to        developing        a         nuanced         understanding of        the         texts,        we        will         practice        and        
hone        the        following        skills:        critical        reading        and        thinking,        intellectual        conversation        and        
debate,        analytical        writing        and        meta-cognitive        learning        strategies.

ACADEMIC HONESTY
University        Policy:
The         intellectual         venture         in         which         we         are         all         engaged         requires         of        
faculty         and         students         alike         the         highest         level         of         personal         and         academic        
integrity.        As        members         of        an        academic        community,        each one         of        us         bears         the        
responsibility        to        participate        in        scholarly        discourse        and        research        in        a        manner        
characterized        by        intellectual        honesty        and        scholarly integrity.
Scholarship,        by        its        very        nature,        is        an        iterative        process,        with        ideas        and        
insights        building        one        upon         the        other.        Collaborative        scholarship        requires         the        
study         of         other         scholars’         work,         the         free         discussion         of         such         work,         and         the        
explicit         acknowledgement         of         those        ideas        in         any        work         that        inform         our         own.        
This        exchange        of        ideas        relies        upon        a        mutual        trust        that        sources,        opinions,        facts,        
and        insights        will        be        properly        noted        and        carefully credited.
In         practical         terms,         this         means         that,         as         students,         you         must         be        
responsible        for        the        full        citations        of        others’        ideas        in        all        of        your        research        papers        
and         projects;         you         must be         scrupulously         honest         when         taking         your        
examinations;         you         must         always         submit         your         own         work         and         not         that         of        
another        student,        scholar,        or        internet agent.
Any        breach        of         this        intellectual        responsibility        is        a        breach        of         faith        with        
the         rest         of         our         academic         community.         It         undermines         our         shared        intellectual        
culture,         and         it         cannot         be         tolerated.         Students         failing         to         meet         these        
responsibilities         should         anticipate         being         asked         to         leave Columbia.

Columbia        College        Honor        Code:
We,         the         undergraduate         students         of         Columbia University,         hereby         pledge         to        
value         the         integrity         of         our         ideas         and         the         ideas         of others         through         honestly        
presenting         our         work,         respecting         authorship,         and         striving not         simply         for        
answers        but        for        understanding        in        the        pursuit        of        our        common scholastic        goals.        
In         this         way,         we         seek         to         foster         an         academic         community         governed by         our        
collective        efforts,        diligence,        and        Code        of        Honor.
From        the        Core’s        Academic        Honesty        Form        (which        you        sign):
Columbia         College         is         dedicated         to         the         highest         ideals         of         integrity         in        
academia.         Therefore,         in         Literature         Humanities         and         Contemporary        
Civilization,         any         instance        of         academic        dishonesty,         attempted        or         actual,        
will        be         reported         to         the         faculty         chair         of         the         course         and         the        dean         of         the        
Core        Curriculum,        who        will        review         the        case        with         the         expectation         that         a        
student        guilty        of        academic        dishonesty        will        receive        the        grade        of        “F”        in        the        
course         and         be         referred         to         dean’s         discipline         for further         institutional

Students         are         expected         to         attend         every         session         of         their         Core         classes.         In         the        
event        that        a        student        must        miss        a        class        due        to        religious        observance,        illness,        or        
family        emergency,        instructors        may        strongly        encourage        (though        not        require)        
that         students         complete        additional        assignments         to        make         up         for        missed         class        
participation.        Unless        the        emergency        or        illness        does        not        permit        them        to        do        so,

instructor         permission.         Instructors         may         require         a         doctor's         note         in         case         of        
illness.        Students        who        miss        class        without        instructor        permission        should        expect

Instructor: Jonathan Ligrani (jcl2219@columbia.edu)
Office Hours: By appointment (schedule through email)
Course Objectives
Based upon a “great works” approach, this course critically explores music within the
canon of Western Art Music from the Middle Ages to the present.
You will cultivate close listening practices, interpretive frameworks, and terminology that
will enable you to connect the technical aspects of musical sound to its expression,
cultural meaning, and historical context. As a discussion-based class, you will
consistently bring your perceptions and ideas together with your peers, engaging in
dynamic conversations that untangle the layers of the philosophical, political, economic,
social, and ideological considerations surrounding how this music operated in its original
context and what it means to us today.
TextbookThere is no required textbook for this course. Readings, listening
assignments, and other required resources will be posted on CourseWorks within the
module corresponding to each class date of the syllabus. You will be responsible for this
content as part of your class participation grade in discussions, the basis of writing
assignments, and testable material in quizzes and examinations.
Assessment
• 15% - 3 Short Written Responses (Check the class schedule for due dates)
• 15% - 3 In-Class Quizzes (Check class schedule) • 20% - Concert Paper (Due May 6 in class): 5-7 pages, based upon your
attendance of the Metropolitan Opera Production of Giuseppe Verdi’s La traviata,
or another concert related to music covered on the syllabus (if chosen, please
discuss this last option with me)
• 15% - Midterm Examination (March 6)
• 20% - Final Examination (date TBA) • 15% - Class Participation
Preparedness:
Students are expected to read and listen critically to the required material before
showing up to class. You are encouraged to take notes that will enable you to contribute
informed opinions during class and engage discursively with your fellow students.
These elements are factored into your participation for the course.
Laptops
Laptops and other electronic devices are not permitted in Music Humanities classrooms.
Exceptions are given only for documented reasons through the Office of Disability
Services (see: Accommodation for Disability).

Attendance
The Core office requires students to attend every class session. Attendance is crucial
for your learning and engagement with colleagues, and your active participation is what
drives the discussion-based dynamic of this course. Attendance will be taken at the
beginning of every class, so do not be late. Excused absences are only permitted for
religious holidays, medical reasons, or family emergencies. For religious holidays,
please let me know in advance; and for medical reasons or family emergencies, please
provide me with a note from your doctor and/or dean. That being said, this section
permits one, no-questions-asked excused absence for the semester, that may be used
for job interviews, travel delays, or other life circumstances. However, no makeup
exams will be given and assignments are due according to their syllabus dates, without
exception, so please factor this into your considerations. Any absences exceeding the
one permitted, or those excused in accordance with Core-office policies (religious
holidays, documented medical reasons, and family emergencies), will result in the
lowering of the student’s final grade by 3 points for each additional absence.
Tardiness
Arriving on time and prepared for each class is essential for your success and the
success of others. Showing up fifteen minutes or later to class will be counted against
you: two late-arrivals of this kind are treated as an unexcused absence and will be
deducted from your final grade accordingly. Arriving late by less than fifteen minutes will
affect your participation score for the day.
Disability Accommodations
Students with disabilities that require special accommodation should please contact the
instructor ASAP so that proper arrangements can be made.
In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, students
must first be registered with Disability Services (DS). More information on the DS
registration process is available online at www.health.columbia.edu/ods. Please allow
for at least three weeks to complete the DS registration process. DS hosts drop-in hours
daily for students with questions about the registration process or to learn more about
services and accommodations.
Academic Integrity
Students are expected to abide by the code for academic standards and integrity as
defined by their school’s Honor Code and Honor Pledge. Students with questions about
what constitutes academic integrity should consult resources provided by the university
or arrange to meet with the instructor. The Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity is
as follows:
The intellectual venture in which we are all engaged requires of faculty and students
alike the highest level of personal and academic integrity. As members of an academic

community, each one of us bears the responsibility to participate in scholarly discourse
and research in a manner characterized by intellectual honesty and scholarly integrity.
Scholarship, by its very nature, is an iterative process, with ideas and insights building
one upon the other. Collaborative scholarship requires the study of other scholars' work,
the free discussion of such work, and the explicit acknowledgement of those ideas in
any work that inform our own. This exchange of ideas relies upon a mutual trust that
sources, opinions, facts, and insights will be properly noted and carefully credited.
In practical terms, this means that, as students, you must be responsible for the full
citations of others' ideas in all of your research papers and projects; you must be
scrupulously honest when taking your examinations; you must always submit your own
work and not that of another student, scholar, or internet agent.
Any breach of this intellectual responsibility is a breach of faith with the rest of our
academic community. It undermines our shared intellectual culture, and it cannot be
tolerated. Students failing to meet these responsibilities should anticipate being asked
to leave Columbia.

Office Hours: After every class, 3:00–4:00 P.M., in White-Gravenor 306-I
These hours provide an opportunity for questions and discussion in a more informal
atmosphere.
Texts: Two books, both available in the University Bookstore (and elsewhere).
 Exploring Psychology in Modules, 9
th ed., by David G. Myers.
NOTE: There are many versions of this text and you must avoid getting the wrong
one! First, get the 9th edition—it’s much more up-to-date. Second, get
EXPLORING Psychology, not plain Psychology—it’s briefer. Third, get Exploring
Psychology IN MODULES—it’s divided into 43 mini-chapters rather than 15 megachapters.
(Worth Publishers, 2014: paperback, ISBN: 978-1-4641-1173-0)
(Note: the loose-leaf version is perfectly fine, ISBN: 978-1-4641-0927-0)
 The Norton Psychology Reader, edited by Gary Marcus. (paperback, Norton, 2006).
Description: This introductory course surveys the field of academic psychology and acquaints
students with its major approaches and topics. This course counts toward the Social
Science component of the College’s General Education requirement, is prerequisite for
all other courses offered by the Psychology Department, and is required for a major in
Psychology.
Learning Goals: The learning goals of the undergraduate psychology program at Georgetown University
may be found at: http://psychology.georgetown.edu/undergraduate/learninggoals/. This
course is intended particularly to address the objectives listed under Goal 1:
Foundational Knowledge. The course also addresses aspects of Goal 3: Application of
Psychology (particularly objectives a and b) and Goal 4: Values in Psychology
(particularly objectives a, b, and c).
Web Site: This class features a web site that uses Blackboard software to allow a variety of course
activities to take place on-line. These include class announcements, assignments,
discussion forums, syllabus and course description. To log on for the first time, go to
the menu at http://campus.georgetown.edu/.

Requirements: Course grades are based on two quizzes, two midterm exams, and a final exam. Exams
will contain both factual questions and conceptual, integrative questions that address
theoretical and philosophical issues. All exams will place approximately equal
emphasis on lectures and readings.
Quizzes: Two classes will begin with a brief quiz that will require only 15 minutes of class time.
The purpose of these quizzes is to motivate students to keep up-to-date with the course
readings and lectures and to provide a sense of what sort of questions will appear on the
examinations. The average of the quizzes will count 10% toward the final course grade.
Midterms: Two midterm examinations will each cover roughly 40% of the course material. Each
exam will be counted 28% toward the final course grade. The purpose of the midterms
is to provide a comprehensive assessment of course mastery. No lecture will be given
on midterm dates, which are listed on the calendar of class topics.
Final Exam: The final examination will take place during the final class period: Thursday, July 3. It
will resemble the midterms in format. It will cover material from the fourth unit as if it
were a midterm but also will ask questions covering the entire course. It will count
34% toward the course grade.
Grading:
Scale: 94+ A 90 - 93 A- 86 - 89 B+ 82 - 85 B 78 - 81 B74 - 77 C+ 70 - 73 C 66 - 69 C- 63 - 65 D+ 60 - 62 D 0 - 59 F
Course Grade: 10% Average of two quizzes 28% First midterm
28% Second midterm 34% Final exam
Course Policies:
Makeup Exams: If a student cannot take one of the quizzes or exams when it is scheduled, no makeup
will be given under any circumstances unless arrangements are made with the student’s
dean.
Grade Appeals: If a student believes that an answer on an exam deserves more credit than was awarded,
the student may appeal to the instructor for reconsideration. All such appeals must be in
writing, and reconsideration will be based on the quality of the appeal as well as the
quality of the answer concerned. Reconsideration can be downward as well as upward
when partial credit has been awarded.
Attendance: It is expected that all students will attend all classes (but attendance is not recorded and
does not factor into grading unless it results in missing a quiz or exam).
Readings: It is recommended that assigned readings be done before the lecture for which they are
assigned.
Honor System: Academic honesty on examinations is of the utmost importance. Examinations are to be
taken without consulting books or notes, and without looking at other students’ exams.
Prior to examinations, of course, students are encouraged to cooperate and to assist each
other as much as they like. Because the grading scale is fixed and not curved, such
helpfulness can never hurt a student's grade and probably will increase his or her own
understanding of the material.
Students with Students with disabilities should contact the Academic Resource Center (Leavey
Disabilities Center, Suite 335; 202-687-8354; arc@georgetown.edu;
Policy: dss.georgetown.edu/index.cfm) before the start of classes to allow their office time to
review the documentation and make recommendations for appropriate accommodations.
If accommodations are recommended, you will be given a letter from ARC to share
with your Instructors . You are personally responsible for completing this process
officially and in a timely manner. Neither accommodations nor exceptions to policies
can be permitted to students who have not completed this process in advance.

Office Hours: TBA
COURSE DATES: May 21-June 15
COURSE MEETING TIME: M-F 10:45 am-12:45 pm
COURSE LOCATION: ICC 102
COURSE DESCRIPTION:  This course is a survey of medieval and early modern history of
the Middle East. The thematic approach of this course will help you to navigate the complexity
entailed by studying a region stretching from Spain to Afghanistan over twelve centuries (CE
600-1800) in a single course. We will explore the rise of Islam and Islamic Empires through
three thematic modules: religious minorities; women and gender; and disease, public health, and
public morality.
LEARNING GOALS: Engaged students who come to class regularly, participate actively in
discussions, and complete all readings and written assignments, will improve their ability to:
1. Think critically about history, not as a collection of self-evident facts, but as
question-driven interpretation, based on evidence, of human experiences, interactions,
and relationships as they change over time.
2. Identify and evaluate primary sources, and use them critically as the basis to formulate
analytical questions and as evidence to build historical interpretations.
3. Articulate ideas verbally and support them with evidence.
4. Engage critically with the work of other historians, their methods, and analytical
concepts.
COURSE READINGS: Students should have access to a copy of the textbook. It is available
for purchase in the bookstore and will be placed on reserve in the library. All other course
readings will be made available via Blackboard.
Ansary, Tamim. Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World through Islamic Eyes. New York:
Public Affairs, 2009.
COURSE POLICIES: I look forward to helping students at every stage of the course and I
encourage you to come speak with me at office hours or schedule an appointment to discuss any
questions or issues you might have. Email is the best way to reach me: kd576@georgetown.edu
DRAFT; SUBJECT TO CHANGE
Assignments: You should plan to submit assignments by the specified due date. Late work will
be penalized by one letter grade per day. To dispute a grade, you must submit a paragraph-length
explanation before we discuss the grade in person.
Absences: Each student has one unexcused absence. There is no need to justify the absence to
me in any manner. I will also excuse absences for health, family emergencies and the like with
proper documentation from the dean’s office. Please let me know in advance about necessary
planned absences before the end of add/drop so that we may discuss suitable arrangements.
Students with documented absences for the celebration of religious holidays and related travel
will not be penalized for missing class and will be given the opportunity to make up missed
work. Tardiness is disruptive to the learning environment so I ask that you do their best to arrive
on time. Students arriving more than 20 minutes late will be counted as absent for the day.
Technology: Laptops are encouraged to facilitate access to readings and other materials being
used in class, but you are asked to use them only for purposes directly related to the course.
Using laptops for non-class related purposes will result in a lower participation grade for the day.
Cell phones must be completely silent and invisible during class.
UNIVERSITY POLICIES & RESOURCES
Honor System: I strongly believe in adherence to the Georgetown honor system and expect that
you do too. I comply with reporting requirements. That said, DO collaborate with your
classmates in study or conversation groups. DO give credit to your fellow students when
appropriate. DO read the honor system booklet:
http://gervaseprograms.georgetown.edu/honor/system/
Special Accommodations: If you believe that you have a disability that will affect your
performance in this class, please contact the Academic Resource Center (arc@georgetown.edu)
for further information. The center is located in the Leavey Center, Suite 335. The Academic
Resource Center is the campus office responsible for reviewing documentation provided by
students with disabilities and for determining reasonable accommodations in accordance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and University policies.
Dedicated Resources for High School Students: High school students enrolled in the course
have access to Josh Fowler, Georgetown’s Director of High School Programs, for academic
advising and support with any challenges they may experience during the summer session. He
holds regular office hours on Thursdays 2-4 pm at 3307 M Street Suite 202, accepts meetings by
appointment through this calendar: http://bit.ly/SPHSOfficeHours and can also be reached by
email at highschool@georgetown.edu and (202) 687-7087.
Title IX Sexual Misconduct Statement: Georgetown University and its faculty are committed to
supporting survivors of sexual misconduct, including relationship violence and sexual assault.
University policy requires faculty members to report any disclosures about sexual misconduct to
the Title IX Coordinator, whose role is to coordinate the University’s response to sexual
misconduct. Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources who can
DRAFT; SUBJECT TO CHANGE
provide support and assistance to survivors of sexual assault and other forms of sexual
misconduct. More information about campus resources and reporting sexual misconduct can be
found at http://sexualassault.georgetown.edu.
ASSIGNMENTS
Attendance and Class Participation (35%): It is important for everyone to attend all class
sessions and demonstrate proficiency in oral discussion. I define class participation as
demonstrating active engagement with the assigned readings by contributing insightful
comments, asking questions that respond to the discussion at hand and demonstrate an
engagement with the readings and themes of discussion, and actively paying attention and
interacting with your classmates and instructor during each class session. If you are having
difficulties participating despite being prepared for class please let me know so we can come up
with strategies to improve your performance in this area. I will drop the lowest participation
grade for those with no absences during the course session. Those who have more than four total
unexcused absences will receive a failing grade for participation and likely for the course.
Mini-Exams (30%): There will be four weekly mini-exams to test your knowledge of the
material covered in the readings, lectures, documentaries, and discussions. The exams will be
composed of key term identifications, a choice of short essay questions, and a map quiz. I will
drop the lowest mini-exam grade when calculating the final grade. Students who are happy with
their first four grades may opt to skip the final exam on the last day of class.
In-Class Writing (20%): The last 15 minutes of Tuesday class sessions will be used for in-class
writing assignments. The purpose of this exercise is to review and reflect on important ideas,
themes, and information. The students will be provided with a prompt for their writing. Notes or
readings may not be used and students will use pen or pencil and paper to complete these tasks.
Reading Presentation (15%): Each student will give one presentation on the readings for a
class session to be assigned at the beginning of the course. Students will give a 20 minute
presentation at the beginning of their assigned course section that introduces the assigned
readings, place them in their historical context, connect them to the themes of the course, and
pose questions for the class to consider during the day’s discussion. Students are encouraged to
use Powerpoint and incorporate images, multi-media elements, maps and other materials as
useful and appropriate.
EVALUATION
Written assignments will be evaluated on five criteria: 1) Thesis; 2) Evidence; 3) Idea
Development; 4) Structure and Organization; and 5) Grammar and Spelling.
An ‘A’ paper is an absolutely excellent and outstanding paper. It is full of original, thoughtful,
and exciting ideas with a sharp thesis and evidence. It consistently, clearly, and effectively
communicates its purpose to its audience in all areas. It has crisp writing, solid development, and
is coherent in terms of organization in style.
DRAFT; SUBJECT TO CHANGE
A ‘B’ paper is a good paper with strong ideas and a thesis to guide it. All the basic requirements
of the assignment are met, and the facts are correct. It has deficiencies in no more than two of the
criteria described above. For example, it might lack coherence in organization or the thesis may
need further development. Overall the ‘B’ paper is a good one, in which the writer basically got
their ideas across.
A ‘C’ paper is a fair paper and the writer has clearly engaged with the topic. There is an attempt
to support a thesis. However, a ‘C’ paper has minor deficiencies in three or more criteria or
major deficiencies in one or more areas that reduce clarity. It may contain inaccuracies or
contradictions, or the organization makes the writer’s ideas difficult to follow. A ‘C’ paper
shows potential but still needs significant work for that potential to be realized.
A ‘D’ paper is a paper in which the writer has barely met the requirements of the assignment.
The paper has major problems with the thesis, evidence and/or style, and fails to communicate its
purpose to the audience. For example, the thesis is absent or very unclear or the writing is
confusing. The writer has made some attempt to engage with the question asked but the paper
reads like a very rough draft.
An ‘F’ paper fails to meet the requirements of the assignment.
Oral assignments including class discussion and presentations will be graded on the basis of
three criteria: 1) Number and quality of contributions; 2) Grasp of reading material; 3) Focus
and engagement.
An ‘A’ range grade means that the student demonstrates close reading of the text through their
ability to analyze argument (s); critique the main supporting evidence; and weigh against
arguments and evidence found in other readings. To achieve an A range discussion grade
students must be focused throughout the class and contribute thoughtful and relevant comments
and questions over the course of the class session in a manner that enriches the overall quality of
the discussion.
A ‘B’ range grade means that the student demonstrates good familiarity with the text through
their ability to explain arguments (s); present the main supporting evidence; and connect to
arguments and evidence found in other readings. To achieve a B range discussion grade students
must be focused throughout the class and contribute thoughtful and relevant comments and
questions that makes a strong contribution to the overall discussion.
A ‘C’ range grade means that the student demonstrates vague familiarity with the text through
their ability to identify the main argument and the basic supporting evidence and make general
connections to other readings. A C range grade indicates that the student has minor problems in
one or more of the criteria. For example, a student might show good familiarity with the text but
is unfocused and does not contribute meaningful comments.
DRAFT; SUBJECT TO CHANGE
A ‘D’ range grade means that the student has major problems in one or more of the criteria. For
example, the student may not demonstrate their familiarity with the text either by not speaking
up at all or by only making contributions that do not reference the readings or paraphrase what
another student has already said.
An ‘F’ range grade means that the student shows no familiarity with the text and is completely
disengaged from the class discussion.

REQUIRED TEXT AND MATERIALS
Faulkner Press Website & Courseware: You will use both the Faulkner WEBSITE and
COURSEWARE for the successful completion of this course. No other books or materials are needed.
Please see “Faulkner Press Information” later in this document for more information on Faulkner
Press.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS, AND ASSIGNMENTS
Communication for this online course is through university email and iCollege. The instructor will
use direct email communication for mostly contacting an individual or group, the Faulkner Media to
post important class announcements. Students can communicate individually with the instructor via
university email as needed. Students are responsible to login and regularly check their GSU email
and iCollege for course updates regularly!
Due Dates are provided in the course schedule for the research requirement and four online exams.
Due dates are not considered test days. Completing a requirement on the due date is highly
discouraged due to the possibility of technical issues. Technical issues typically are NOT considered an
excuse for late work as there is ample time to resolve any issues. Students are at liberty to finish all
course requirements prior to the scheduled due dates. It is possible to complete the course within a
few weeks by making a concerted effort on the course over a short period of time. Due dates for
exams and the research requirements are fixed, final, and there are no make-ups. THERE ARE
NO EXEPTIONS!!! 
Participation is exhibited by time management and meeting course due dates. Students who fail to
meet deadlines and keep pace with the course are not fully participating in the course. Students read
reference material, listen to lectures, view slides, and work with practice questions in preparation
for the four online exams. The final course grade is derived from the accumulated scores on the
four exams and the research requirement. Students’ constructive feedback of this course is valued,
so please complete the online course evaluation at the end of the semester.
Attendance is reflected by purchasing materials, registering courseware with Faulkner Media, taking
online exams, and completing the research requirements. Practice tests are for students’ use only
and are not a factor in determining final grades. However, the instructor may monitor the amount of
time students spend interacting with the course materials and using the practice questions.
Please note that in order to verify your attendance in this class (which is subsequently used
for financial aid purposes), you must participate in this course. Participation is regarded as having
downloaded the courseware, completing assignments, participating in practice tests, and
communicating with your instructor. If you do not download the courseware and actively engage
with the courseware, we have no record of you attending class, and therefore cannot verify your
attendance.
Failure to download the software and communicate (e.g., via email, phone, or in person) with
your instructor in a timely manner will not allow us to verify your attendance in the class. If your
instructor cannot verify your attendance for any reason within the first 1-3 weeks of the semester,
your financial aid may be jeopardized, and the Registrar’s office will withdraw you from the
course. If this happens, there is no recourse. In addition, purchasing the courseware and
participating in the course after your attendance has been verified is not grounds for the CPS
department to reinstate you back in the class if you have been withdrawn.
Assignments
1. Course Contract (worth 10 points). The very first thing you need to do in this course is to complete
the course contract. You can locate this contact here:
https://gsu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_6GoY5CHqAdZvZtz
2. Faulkner Courseware exams (worth a total of 400 points). Please see the “Faulkner Press
Information” section later in this document for more information on exam structure and content.
• The four online exams AND the research component determine final grades for the
course. Each exam is comprised of 50 items worth two points each. Thus, each exam is
worth 100 points. The research component is worth 50 points. The total number of
possible points for the course is 460.
• You CAN complete all the modules, and their exams, EARLY! You MUST complete the
exams by the due date listed in the course timeline close to the end of this syllabus. If you
fail to complete the exams by that time you will receive a score of zero for any and all
exams missed regardless of the exam score that you see on the Faulkner Press Courseware.
• After completing exams, students are advised to log into the Faulkner Media website to
check that exam scores are posted there. IF YOU CANNOT SEE YOUR EXAM
SCORES THERE, THE INSTRUCTOR WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR
SCORE! If you do not see the exam score there please contact
questions@faulknerpress.com.
3. CPS Department Research Requirement (worth a total of 50 points). The primary goals of a
university are to provide an educational experience for its students while advancing knowledge
through research. The Department of Counseling and Psychological Services is committed to
each of these goals and believes that one important aspect of your educational experience is to
learn, preferably through direct experience, how psychological research is conducted. Thus, the
Department requires that students in our undergraduate courses gain research experience.
Research experience can be gained in one of the two ways (SONA or the Alternative Research 
Assignment, both later in this syllabus). Either of the two alternatives provided is acceptable;
however, by serving as a participant in research (SONA), you will learn about research projects
and contribute to the advancement of knowledge. It is often only through research with human
subjects that important questions about human behavior can be answered. A total of 50 points
(i.e., 4 research credit hours) toward your final grade is earned by successfully completing either
SONA or the Alternative Research Assignment. This accounts for approximately 11% of your
course grade. Additional information about participation in CPS department research is contained
in Appendix A.
4. There are NO extra credit opportunities offered for this course!
RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT INFORMATION
Students must decide if they will complete the SONA/Research Participation OR the Alternative
Research Assignment! Both are outlined below. You cannot submit the same paper OR use the same
SONA credits for multiple courses! You will need to complete separate SONA credits or use different
articles/write separate papers for each online class you are taking!
SONA/Research Participation: You may participate in four (4) hours of research approved by the
Counseling and Psychological Services Department. This involves completing a general survey (1
credit) and participating in three (3) hours as a participant in research. At least one hour (out of the
three) should include one advanced study (i.e., a study that does not involve a cross-sectional online
survey study). Instead, one (or more) hour(s) must include choice of lab, experimental, interview, or
daily diary studies. Please note that all three credits could come from lab, experimental, interview, or
daily diary studies; however, not all three credits could come from online survey studies. When
choosing this option, please keep in mind that many of the advanced study options will take place inperson and on-campus. If this is not feasible for you, you may want to consider the Alterative 2 option.
Please see the “SONA Registration and FAQ” section later in this document for details on SONA
registration.
General screening survey. To cut down on completing redundant surveys, everyone can earn
0.5 credit by taking the general screening survey. The general screening survey is a prerequisite for all
other research studies. The first part takes around 15-20 minutes and involves demographics and
measures of personality traits. If you provide poor quality data on the first part, you will not receive an
invitation to complete the second part. The second part takes another 30-40 minutes and includes a few
commonly studied constructs such as happiness or meaning in life.
Research participation: Studies vary in length; you will receive 1/2 credits for every 30
minutes of participation. For example, a study lasting 30 minutes would earn you .5 credits. A study
lasting an hour and half would earn you 1.5 credits. Each semester, investigations on a wide range of
psychological phenomena are conducted at a variety of times. You should be able to select several
studies to fit your schedule. Signing up to participate in approved research projects is done online at the
GSU CPS Department Research Participation Pool website (http://gsucps.sona-systems.com.) Credit for
your participation in experiments will be posted to this website. Please be sure to register using the
correct CRN (83296) for this class. Otherwise, you will not receive credit.
Advanced study: One of the four credits earned must be an “Advanced Study.” These are
clearly labeled in the SONA system, and require something above and beyond the standard survey
participation. For instance, some advanced studies might require students to come participate in an inperson session for interview, observation, or other form of data collection. Other advanced studies
might ask that you respond to follow-up questionnaires.
Alternative Research Assignment: Writing Assignment on Peer Reviewed Article.
Guidelines for paper. This assignment is submitted in two parts. Both parts are submitted
directly to your instructor. Each part is equivalent to two hours of research credit (25 points for each
part, in order to achieve a total of 50 points towards your final grade).
Part 1/Appendix C: You will upload two peer-reviewed empirical journal articles from an
APA or ACA journal (see list) that has been published within the past five years. These two peerreviewed empirical articles must be topically related to one another. In addition, you will write a
review of each article, as if you were reviewing for the journal editor. To do this, please complete the
worksheet, Appendix C. You just present a brief summary of the purpose of the study, the research
question(s) posed or hypotheses, the sample collected, the measures, and the major findings from the
study. Afterwards, you will then provide a numbered list of limitations of the article. You should be
able to find all of this information in the text of the article.
Part 2: You will write a critical review that synthesizes your reactions to the two articles. Your
paper must be APA style (e.g., title page, no abstract, double-spaced, reference page). The paper
should be 800-1000 words. Please use the following organization. The first section should include a
general summary of the studies conducted (between 200-400 words).
The second section should involve your critical analysis of the articles (less than 600-800
words). Identify and defend the article that makes the strongest argument and will have the more
significant impact on the topic/population it is written about. Integrate information from your course
into the critique of the article. You might discuss the practical significance of the research.
The third section will involve your suggestions for future research in this area, based on what
you have learned in your course. This should not be a summary of what the authors suggested as
recommendations for future research, but rather, your own personal suggestions for future research
based on the reported findings.
Please use headings in alignment with APA style (i.e., Summary, Analysis, Suggestions for
Future Research). The paper will be graded based on the quality of content and alignment with APA
style. Each article may earn up to four credits toward your research requirement. You must turn in
both your summary/analysis of the article and a PDF of the article (or link to the article if a PDF
is not available) when you submit your work for this alternative. Be sure to write your paper in your
own words! Using actual phrases from the article without quotes is plagiarism. Paraphrasing sentences
(e.g., substituting words here and there) is also plagiarism. Using the authors’ ideas without providing
credit is also plagiarism. You also may not plagiarize your own work from another course. Any
plagiarism will result in zero credit for the assignment. 
FINAL GRADE INFORMATION
Final grades are based on the scale below according to GSU policies. The +/- system is not used for this
course. There are no opportunities for extra credit.
Assignment Possible Points Points Grade
Exam 1 100 414-460 A
Exam 2 100 366-413 B
Exam 3 100 315-365 C
Exam 4 100 270-314 D
Research Option 50 0-269 F
Course Contract 10
COURSE SCHEDULE AND TIMED ONLINE EXAMS
All course requirements must be completed by their respective due dates!!! As mentioned, due
dates for the research requirement and exams are fixed and final, and there are no make-ups. Again,
students are at liberty to complete the research requirements and take exams prior to scheduled
deadlines. However, exams must be submitted BEFORE midnight (i.e., 11:59 EST) of the final day
of the exam period to be counted. NOTE: the last day to withdraw without academic penalty is listed
in the course schedule close to the end of this syllabus. The following reflects the Course Schedule for
this semester. THE EXAM DEADLINES ARE FIRM!
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
**Very Important** Please do NOT contact the instructor, GSU, or the CPS Department
regarding technical issues as these are most likely due to specific issues with students’ PC/laptop
and the courseware and the instructor cannot answer these questions. The instructor and GSU will not
be responsible for any issues or problems students have with downloading or using the Faulkner
Media courseware. All technical assistance is channeled through Faulkner Press
(questions@faulknerpress.com). Allow Faulkner enough time to respond. Do not try and access
the courseware at the last minute to take an exam and expect the help desk to be immediately able to
fix any technical problems. Faulkner manages multiple online classes with hundreds of students and
resolving technical issues can take some time.
Faulkner Press Help Desk: Technical questions, such as issues with downloading, navigating the
courseware, and accessing and/or verifying exam scores, need to be directed to the Faulkner Media
Help Desk:
• Online: Go to faulknerpress.com/gsu and select Help Desk; the Faulkner Media Helpdesk staff
can provide technical assistance.
• Email: send questions to questions@faulknerpress.com
• Phone: Call the toll-free number 1-855-393-3393. This is the least preferred method as
students may have to leave a message.
DEPARTMENTAL POLICIES
Cultural and Ethnic Diversity:
The department of Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) values diversity and is committed to
fostering and maintaining an educational environment which appreciates individual differences in
all areas of departmental operation including selection and admissions, hiring, classroom
instruction, texts and materials, clinical practice and supervision, research and departmental
administration, and policy formation. To this end, CPS will not tolerate or condone any actions,
practices, or processes by any CPS faculty member, staff person, or student which discriminate
against or is prejudicial toward any person or group based on race, sex, age, religion, ethnicity,
nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status.
Accommodations for Students with Special Needs:
Students with disabilities requiring accommodations must be registered with the Office of Disability
Services at Georgia State before an instructor can modify instruction or expectations. The Office of
Disability Services may be contacted at (404) 413-1560. Any student with a disability who may
require special accommodations is requested to make an appointment with the instructor at the
beginning of the class session. Bring a copy of the Student Accommodation Form to the meeting.
Students must self-identify so that arrangements can be made according to the University's policy
and guidelines provided by the Office of Disability Services (Suite 230 New Student Center).
Policy on Academic Honesty
Students are expected to recognize and uphold the highest standards of intellectual and academic
integrity. For explicit conversate of this policy students are adviced to refer to the General Catalog for
the University and Student Handbook (http://codeofconduct.gsu.edu/). This policy discusses
plagiarism, cheating on examinations, unauthorized collaboration, falsification, and multiple
submissions of material for credit without permission. 
Email Communication Etiquette
• Emails sent to an instructor should be treated like a business letter: You will not err if you
are too formal, but there is the possibility of committing many gaffes if you are too informal.
Address your instructor respectfully.
• The subject header should be informative: Write a few words indicating the purpose of your
message: ""Request for a space in your class,"" for example.
• Do not expect an instant response. Although we have all become accustomed to the
instantaneous quality of electronic communication, your instructors want you to know that they
simply cannot always answer a message quickly. Allow them a day or two, or even more, to
respond. You can re-send the message if you haven't heard back in five days or so.
• Email Style
o Do not treat email as if it is an instant-message exchange.
o Do not use smiley faces or other emoticons when emailing instructors, and don't
use all those internet acronyms, abbreviations, and shortened spellings (e.g., LOL,
or ""U"" for ""you""). Similarly, don't confuse email style with txt style. That form of
electronic shorthand signals a level of intimacy that is inappropriate for exchanges with
your instructors.
o Write grammatically, spell correctly, and avoid silly mistakes. Proofread. Use the
spelling checker. Especially double-check for embarrassing errors in your subject
header. Show that you care about how you present yourself in writing to your instructor.
o Use paragraph breaks to help organize your message. It's hard to read a long
unbroken stream of words on a screen.
• Email content:
o Do not use email to rant or whine: Sometimes the very appearance of a message can
signal ""rant"": very long paragraphs, no capital letters, no sentence breaks. These are not
fun to read and may well elicit the exact opposite response that you intend.
o Keep most messages to under a screen in length: Be sure to include enough
information so that your reader can understand what you are requesting. Provide a bit of
background or context if necessary. State your request clearly.
o Take extra steps to minimize the email exchange: For example, if you are requesting
an appointment, state your purpose and name the times that you are available in your
initial message. Your respondent may then be able to answer you with only one
additional message.
o Quote selectively and briefly from any prior messages to provide context and
background. Although sometimes it's good to quote an entire exchange so as to keep a
record of what's been said and decided, often that's unnecessary and simply ends up
making a message too long and cluttering the screen.
o Finally, be respectful, and think about what kinds of things might sound odd or
offensive to your instructor.

required and are not submitted but are highly recommended as a study aid.
 Online Exams: Select this option from the Assessment menu to complete the four
online exams and submit your scores to the online grade book. An exam covers
one section (3-4 topics) of reading and lecture material. Approximately 50-70% of
the items on an exam are randomly drawn from the pools of practice questions
for the topics it covers. The other 30-50% are randomly drawn from a different
pool of questions that students do not see. Each exam is unique because 50 items
are randomly drawn from the hidden and practice question pools. Each online exam
is worth 100 points (400 points total) toward your final grade for the class.
Exams must be completed by the deadlines! There are no extensions, retakes,
or makeups offered without documentation of an acceptable emergency!
o Flash Drive: Your instructor recommends that you download the software onto your
personal computer AND onto a flash drive. As computers crash, viruses are transmitted,

SONA Registration and FAQ
We use this system to maintain the number of research credits received. You will also receive
reminders or other announcements related to the research requirement through this system, so if you
are not registered then you will not get these emails. Register for an account immediately.
Regardless of which option you choose, it is very important that you register for an account through
SONA systems. To do so, please follow these instructions:
1. Visit this webpage: http://gsucps.sona-systems.com
2. In bottom left, click “request an account here.”
3. Create your own ID and password. Please use your GSU email. Don’t forget to include
@student.gsu.edu (not just @gsu.edu.)
4. If you are taking multiple CPS courses this semester, you only need one account in SONA to
manage your research participation.
Please DO NOT confuse the SONA webpage used by the Psych department courses for webpage
used by the CPS department. It is a separate webpage and you will not find CPS courses listed.
Again, the CPS SONA website is https://gsucps.sona-systems.com
Please note:
If you complete research opportunities for the psychology department
you WILL NOT receive any credit for your research participation.
A total of 50 points toward your final grade is earned by successfully completing some combination of
the research-related alternatives described above. Please note that you have to complete 4 credits of
research for EACH COURSE you are taking. Therefore, if you are taking 2 CPS online courses,
you have to complete 8 credits. If you are taking 3 CPS online courses, you have to complete 12
credits of research. If you are taking multiple CPS online courses or have taken CPS online courses in
prior semesters, surveys may be limited to you. Therefore, Research Alternative #2 may be the best
option for you to complete.
The remainder of this appendix contains a set of frequently asked questions related to SONA. If your
question is not covered in the FAQ document, then please contact the CPS SONA administrator at
cpssona@gmail.com.
SONA Frequently asked question
1. Do I need a separate account for each CPS class?
a. No. The system allows you to include multiple CPS courses and track the credit earned
for each class requirement. You can add multiple courses by selecting ""My Profile""
from the Main Menu. Select the ""Change Courses"" option under the list of existing
courses you are in. Select from the available list of courses while holding the ""Ctrl""
control key and update the changes.
2. Can I reassign credit from a previous semester course to a current semester course?
a. No. The credits do not transfer between semesters. At the end of each semester, the
credits are archived. You cannot reassign credit earned from a previous semester to a
currently enrolled course.
3. Can I reassign credits from one CPS course to another during the same semester?
a. Yes! You can reassign credit between courses that you are actively enrolled in the
present semester. See question 6 to learn how.
4. How do I apply credit from the General Survey to all my CPS classes?
a. Each part of the General Survey is worth 0.5 credit for 30 minutes of participation. You
can only apply earned credit toward one single course. If you are enrolled in multiple 
CPS courses, you may only apply the credit earned from the general survey to one of
the courses but not to all.
5. How do I assign credit from one course to another?
a. If you belong to multiple courses in the same semester, you may reassign a credit from
one course to another. To do this, simply use the ""Reassign"" link that appears when you
view your progress under ""My Schedule & Credits"" tab. The link appears under the
course entry for each item in your progress listing. You may not split a credit between
two courses, for example by assigning 2 credits of a 3-credit study to one course, and 1
credit from that study to another course.
6. How do I select multiple courses?
a. In the initial set up of the account, the ""Courses"" drop-box allows you to select multiple
courses by holding the ""Ctrl"" key while you select the courses. After the initial set up:
If you are trying to add another course, go to ""My Profile"" from the Main Menu. Select
the ""Change Courses"" option under the list of existing courses you are in. Select from
the available list of courses and update the changes.
7. I accidently selected the wrong instructor for my course. Is it possible to change the account to
the right instructor?
a. Go to ""Change Courses"" underneath your current course listing and remove the existing
course. Then add yourself to the correct course and instructor. Credits that were
assigned to the previous course will not be automatically reassigned to the new correct
course. You should receive a warning about this and taken to the page where you may
reassign your earned credits.
8. I completed a survey but have not received credit. Why?
a. Most surveys offered through SONA are set up to grant credit automatically once the
survey is complete. Some studies are set up so that the researcher manually enters the
credit within 48 hours once he or she verifies completion. Best thing to do is (a) make
sure you signed up for the study, (b) then complete the study through the end and
submit before exiting the survey, and (c) contact the SONA administrator for assistance
if you still haven't received credit.
9. I don't see Psych courses listed.
a. The Psych courses are not going to be listed in the Counseling & Psychological
Services (CPS) SONA site. To sign up for the GSU Psychology Research and Testing
Site go to http://gsu.SONA-systems.com and contact cpssona@gmail.com for
assistance with their department SONA site.
10. Is it necessary to take the General Survey for each CPS course this semester?
a. The General Survey is a prerequisite that must be completed before you can participate
in other research studies during the semester. Once the survey is completed one time
during the semester, you are allowed to sign up for other studies in SONA.
11. What does the general survey mean by providing three ""informants""?
a. Informants mean three people you know that would feel comfortable participating in a
separate survey, upon asking them. Once you provide the contact information for the 3
individuals, the researcher will contact them separately at a later time. The participant
does not receive credit for providing three informants. As noted in the syllabus, here's
how a student earns their 1 credit for the general survey: ""The first screen, titled
General Survey, involves a 30-minute survey at the beginning of the semester (.5
credits). You can earn an additional .5 credits if you complete a 10-minute follow-up
survey, titled General Survey Part II, towards the end of the semester. Thus, the general
survey is worth 1 credit total if you do both parts.""
12. I emailed the CPS SONA email address and received an un-deliverable message. What should
I do?
a. On rare occasions, students may experience this problem due to coping and pasting the
cpssona@gmail.com address into the address bar. If this is the case, type the email 
address directly into the address bar and see if it transmits. If you still experience
issues, forward the email to your instructor and request that they contact the SONA
Administrator and the CPS Online Course Coordinator directly. This will ensure a
timestamp of your correspondence. 
Appendix A: Additional Information on the Research Requirement
What if the student or researcher is unable to keep the appointment?
If a student is unable to make a participation time that he/she has signed up for, it is his/her
responsibility to notify the researcher via email or by telephone at least 24 hours in advance of the
scheduled time. Both the contact number and email address for each researcher are given on the page
for his/her study on the GSU Research Participation Pool website.
If the researcher cancels the appointment more than 24 hours in advance, the student will not
receive the research credit. If the appointment is cancelled within less than 24 hours, the student will
receive credit. In the event that a researcher is not present at the scheduled location and time and has
not cancelled the appointment, the student should notify his/her instructor within 24 hours.
Rights of the Students, Relative to the Requirements
1. Autonomy - Students are free to elect any of the alternatives listed in order to complete their
research requirement.
2. Informed Consent - Students who elect Alternative 1 are entitled to receive, before they
consent to participate, as much information as is needed for them to make an intelligent
decision as to whether or not to participate. Students should receive a print copy of the
informed consent agreement for each study in which they volunteer to participate.
3. Right to Withdraw - Students may drop out of any study at any time after showing up and
learning about the research and what their participation will entail. You will not earn credit
towards your research requirement for a study from which you withdraw.
4. Right to Respect and Dignity - Researchers will treat all students who volunteer to participate
in their projects with respect and dignity.
5. Debriefing - Students who elect Alternative 1 will receive an explanation from the researcher
regarding the purpose of the study and the role that the student played in it. In some cases, this
explanation may be postponed until after the student's participation in the research is complete,
so as not to affect the student's behavior during the study.
6. Recourse - If a student feels that his/her rights have been violated, or that he/she has been
treated unfairly or in any other way harmed by means of participation in research, he/she
should register a complaint with one of the following individuals:
a. his/her course instructor
b. the CPS undergraduate course coordinator, Jo Saint, Ed.S. (msaint1@gsu.edu)
c. the Counseling and Psychological Services Department Chair, Brian Dew, Ph.D.
(bdew@gsu.edu).

REQUIRED TEXT AND MATERIALS
Faulkner Press Website & Courseware: You will use both the Faulkner WEBSITE and
COURSEWARE for the successful completion of this course. No other books or materials are needed.
Please see “Faulkner Press Information” later in this document for more information on Faulkner
Press.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS, AND ASSIGNMENTS
Communication for this online course is through university email and iCollege. The instructor will
use direct email communication for mostly contacting an individual or group, the Faulkner Media to
post important class announcements. Students can communicate individually with the instructor via
university email as needed. Students are responsible to login and regularly check their GSU email
and iCollege for course updates regularly!
Due Dates are provided in the course schedule for the research requirement and four online exams.
Due dates are not considered test days. Completing a requirement on the due date is highly
discouraged due to the possibility of technical issues. Technical issues typically are NOT considered an
excuse for late work as there is ample time to resolve any issues. Students are at liberty to finish all
course requirements prior to the scheduled due dates. It is possible to complete the course within a
few weeks by making a concerted effort on the course over a short period of time. Due dates for
exams and the research requirements are fixed, final, and there are no make-ups. THERE ARE
NO EXEPTIONS!!! 
Participation is exhibited by time management and meeting course due dates. Students who fail to
meet deadlines and keep pace with the course are not fully participating in the course. Students read
reference material, listen to lectures, view slides, and work with practice questions in preparation
for the four online exams. The final course grade is derived from the accumulated scores on the
four exams and the research requirement. Students’ constructive feedback of this course is valued,
so please complete the online course evaluation at the end of the semester.
Attendance is reflected by purchasing materials, registering courseware with Faulkner Media, taking
online exams, and completing the research requirements. Practice tests are for students’ use only
and are not a factor in determining final grades. However, the instructor may monitor the amount of
time students spend interacting with the course materials and using the practice questions.
Please note that in order to verify your attendance in this class (which is subsequently used
for financial aid purposes), you must participate in this course. Participation is regarded as having
downloaded the courseware, completing assignments, participating in practice tests, and
communicating with your instructor. If you do not download the courseware and actively engage
with the courseware, we have no record of you attending class, and therefore cannot verify your
attendance.
Failure to download the software and communicate (e.g., via email, phone, or in person) with
your instructor in a timely manner will not allow us to verify your attendance in the class. If your
instructor cannot verify your attendance for any reason within the first 1-3 weeks of the semester,
your financial aid may be jeopardized, and the Registrar’s office will withdraw you from the
course. If this happens, there is no recourse. In addition, purchasing the courseware and
participating in the course after your attendance has been verified is not grounds for the CPS
department to reinstate you back in the class if you have been withdrawn.
Assignments
1. Course Contract (worth 10 points). The very first thing you need to do in this course is to complete
the course contract. You can locate this contact here:
https://gsu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_6GoY5CHqAdZvZtz
2. Faulkner Courseware exams (worth a total of 400 points). Please see the “Faulkner Press
Information” section later in this document for more information on exam structure and content.
• The four online exams AND the research component determine final grades for the
course. Each exam is comprised of 50 items worth two points each. Thus, each exam is
worth 100 points. The research component is worth 50 points. The total number of
possible points for the course is 460.
• You CAN complete all the modules, and their exams, EARLY! You MUST complete the
exams by the due date listed in the course timeline close to the end of this syllabus. If you
fail to complete the exams by that time you will receive a score of zero for any and all
exams missed regardless of the exam score that you see on the Faulkner Press Courseware.
• After completing exams, students are advised to log into the Faulkner Media website to
check that exam scores are posted there. IF YOU CANNOT SEE YOUR EXAM
SCORES THERE, THE INSTRUCTOR WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR
SCORE! If you do not see the exam score there please contact
questions@faulknerpress.com.
3. CPS Department Research Requirement (worth a total of 50 points). The primary goals of a
university are to provide an educational experience for its students while advancing knowledge
through research. The Department of Counseling and Psychological Services is committed to
each of these goals and believes that one important aspect of your educational experience is to
learn, preferably through direct experience, how psychological research is conducted. Thus, the
Department requires that students in our undergraduate courses gain research experience.
Research experience can be gained in one of the two ways (SONA or the Alternative Research 
Assignment, both later in this syllabus). Either of the two alternatives provided is acceptable;
however, by serving as a participant in research (SONA), you will learn about research projects
and contribute to the advancement of knowledge. It is often only through research with human
subjects that important questions about human behavior can be answered. A total of 50 points
(i.e., 4 research credit hours) toward your final grade is earned by successfully completing either
SONA or the Alternative Research Assignment. This accounts for approximately 11% of your
course grade. Additional information about participation in CPS department research is contained
in Appendix A.
4. There are NO extra credit opportunities offered for this course!
RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT INFORMATION
Students must decide if they will complete the SONA/Research Participation OR the Alternative
Research Assignment! Both are outlined below. You cannot submit the same paper OR use the same
SONA credits for multiple courses! You will need to complete separate SONA credits or use different
articles/write separate papers for each online class you are taking!
SONA/Research Participation: You may participate in four (4) hours of research approved by the
Counseling and Psychological Services Department. This involves completing a general survey (1
credit) and participating in three (3) hours as a participant in research. At least one hour (out of the
three) should include one advanced study (i.e., a study that does not involve a cross-sectional online
survey study). Instead, one (or more) hour(s) must include choice of lab, experimental, interview, or
daily diary studies. Please note that all three credits could come from lab, experimental, interview, or
daily diary studies; however, not all three credits could come from online survey studies. When
choosing this option, please keep in mind that many of the advanced study options will take place inperson and on-campus. If this is not feasible for you, you may want to consider the Alterative 2 option.
Please see the “SONA Registration and FAQ” section later in this document for details on SONA
registration.
General screening survey. To cut down on completing redundant surveys, everyone can earn
0.5 credit by taking the general screening survey. The general screening survey is a prerequisite for all
other research studies. The first part takes around 15-20 minutes and involves demographics and
measures of personality traits. If you provide poor quality data on the first part, you will not receive an
invitation to complete the second part. The second part takes another 30-40 minutes and includes a few
commonly studied constructs such as happiness or meaning in life.
Research participation: Studies vary in length; you will receive 1/2 credits for every 30
minutes of participation. For example, a study lasting 30 minutes would earn you .5 credits. A study
lasting an hour and half would earn you 1.5 credits. Each semester, investigations on a wide range of
psychological phenomena are conducted at a variety of times. You should be able to select several
studies to fit your schedule. Signing up to participate in approved research projects is done online at the
GSU CPS Department Research Participation Pool website (http://gsucps.sona-systems.com.) Credit for
your participation in experiments will be posted to this website. Please be sure to register using the
correct CRN (83296) for this class. Otherwise, you will not receive credit.
Advanced study: One of the four credits earned must be an “Advanced Study.” These are
clearly labeled in the SONA system, and require something above and beyond the standard survey
participation. For instance, some advanced studies might require students to come participate in an inperson session for interview, observation, or other form of data collection. Other advanced studies
might ask that you respond to follow-up questionnaires.
Alternative Research Assignment: Writing Assignment on Peer Reviewed Article.
Guidelines for paper. This assignment is submitted in two parts. Both parts are submitted
directly to your instructor. Each part is equivalent to two hours of research credit (25 points for each
part, in order to achieve a total of 50 points towards your final grade).
Part 1/Appendix C: You will upload two peer-reviewed empirical journal articles from an
APA or ACA journal (see list) that has been published within the past five years. These two peerreviewed empirical articles must be topically related to one another. In addition, you will write a
review of each article, as if you were reviewing for the journal editor. To do this, please complete the
worksheet, Appendix C. You just present a brief summary of the purpose of the study, the research
question(s) posed or hypotheses, the sample collected, the measures, and the major findings from the
study. Afterwards, you will then provide a numbered list of limitations of the article. You should be
able to find all of this information in the text of the article.
Part 2: You will write a critical review that synthesizes your reactions to the two articles. Your
paper must be APA style (e.g., title page, no abstract, double-spaced, reference page). The paper
should be 800-1000 words. Please use the following organization. The first section should include a
general summary of the studies conducted (between 200-400 words).
The second section should involve your critical analysis of the articles (less than 600-800
words). Identify and defend the article that makes the strongest argument and will have the more
significant impact on the topic/population it is written about. Integrate information from your course
into the critique of the article. You might discuss the practical significance of the research.
The third section will involve your suggestions for future research in this area, based on what
you have learned in your course. This should not be a summary of what the authors suggested as
recommendations for future research, but rather, your own personal suggestions for future research
based on the reported findings.
Please use headings in alignment with APA style (i.e., Summary, Analysis, Suggestions for
Future Research). The paper will be graded based on the quality of content and alignment with APA
style. Each article may earn up to four credits toward your research requirement. You must turn in
both your summary/analysis of the article and a PDF of the article (or link to the article if a PDF
is not available) when you submit your work for this alternative. Be sure to write your paper in your
own words! Using actual phrases from the article without quotes is plagiarism. Paraphrasing sentences
(e.g., substituting words here and there) is also plagiarism. Using the authors’ ideas without providing
credit is also plagiarism. You also may not plagiarize your own work from another course. Any
plagiarism will result in zero credit for the assignment. 
FINAL GRADE INFORMATION
Final grades are based on the scale below according to GSU policies. The +/- system is not used for this
course. There are no opportunities for extra credit.

COURSE SCHEDULE AND TIMED ONLINE EXAMS
All course requirements must be completed by their respective due dates!!! As mentioned, due
dates for the research requirement and exams are fixed and final, and there are no make-ups. Again,
students are at liberty to complete the research requirements and take exams prior to scheduled
deadlines. However, exams must be submitted BEFORE midnight (i.e., 11:59 EST) of the final day
of the exam period to be counted. NOTE: the last day to withdraw without academic penalty is listed
in the course schedule close to the end of this syllabus. The following reflects the Course Schedule for
this semester. THE EXAM DEADLINES ARE FIRM!
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
**Very Important** Please do NOT contact the instructor, GSU, or the CPS Department
regarding technical issues as these are most likely due to specific issues with students’ PC/laptop
and the courseware and the instructor cannot answer these questions. The instructor and GSU will not
be responsible for any issues or problems students have with downloading or using the Faulkner
Media courseware. All technical assistance is channeled through Faulkner Press
(questions@faulknerpress.com). Allow Faulkner enough time to respond. Do not try and access
the courseware at the last minute to take an exam and expect the help desk to be immediately able to
fix any technical problems. Faulkner manages multiple online classes with hundreds of students and
resolving technical issues can take some time.
Faulkner Press Help Desk: Technical questions, such as issues with downloading, navigating the
courseware, and accessing and/or verifying exam scores, need to be directed to the Faulkner Media
Help Desk:
• Online: Go to faulknerpress.com/gsu and select Help Desk; the Faulkner Media Helpdesk staff
can provide technical assistance.
• Email: send questions to questions@faulknerpress.com
• Phone: Call the toll-free number 1-855-393-3393. This is the least preferred method as
students may have to leave a message.
DEPARTMENTAL POLICIES
Cultural and Ethnic Diversity:
The department of Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) values diversity and is committed to
fostering and maintaining an educational environment which appreciates individual differences in
all areas of departmental operation including selection and admissions, hiring, classroom
instruction, texts and materials, clinical practice and supervision, research and departmental
administration, and policy formation. To this end, CPS will not tolerate or condone any actions,
practices, or processes by any CPS faculty member, staff person, or student which discriminate
against or is prejudicial toward any person or group based on race, sex, age, religion, ethnicity,
nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status.
Accommodations for Students with Special Needs:
Students with disabilities requiring accommodations must be registered with the Office of Disability
Services at Georgia State before an instructor can modify instruction or expectations. The Office of
Disability Services may be contacted at (404) 413-1560. Any student with a disability who may
require special accommodations is requested to make an appointment with the instructor at the
beginning of the class session. Bring a copy of the Student Accommodation Form to the meeting.
Students must self-identify so that arrangements can be made according to the University's policy
and guidelines provided by the Office of Disability Services (Suite 230 New Student Center).
Policy on Academic Honesty
Students are expected to recognize and uphold the highest standards of intellectual and academic
integrity. For explicit conversate of this policy students are adviced to refer to the General Catalog for
the University and Student Handbook (http://codeofconduct.gsu.edu/). This policy discusses
plagiarism, cheating on examinations, unauthorized collaboration, falsification, and multiple
submissions of material for credit without permission. 
Email Communication Etiquette
• Emails sent to an instructor should be treated like a business letter: You will not err if you
are too formal, but there is the possibility of committing many gaffes if you are too informal.
Address your instructor respectfully.
• The subject header should be informative: Write a few words indicating the purpose of your
message: ""Request for a space in your class,"" for example.
• Do not expect an instant response. Although we have all become accustomed to the
instantaneous quality of electronic communication, your instructors want you to know that they
simply cannot always answer a message quickly. Allow them a day or two, or even more, to
respond. You can re-send the message if you haven't heard back in five days or so.
• Email Style
o Do not treat email as if it is an instant-message exchange.
o Do not use smiley faces or other emoticons when emailing instructors, and don't
use all those internet acronyms, abbreviations, and shortened spellings (e.g., LOL,
or ""U"" for ""you""). Similarly, don't confuse email style with txt style. That form of
electronic shorthand signals a level of intimacy that is inappropriate for exchanges with
your instructors.
o Write grammatically, spell correctly, and avoid silly mistakes. Proofread. Use the
spelling checker. Especially double-check for embarrassing errors in your subject
header. Show that you care about how you present yourself in writing to your instructor.
o Use paragraph breaks to help organize your message. It's hard to read a long
unbroken stream of words on a screen.
• Email content:
o Do not use email to rant or whine: Sometimes the very appearance of a message can
signal ""rant"": very long paragraphs, no capital letters, no sentence breaks. These are not
fun to read and may well elicit the exact opposite response that you intend.
o Keep most messages to under a screen in length: Be sure to include enough
information so that your reader can understand what you are requesting. Provide a bit of
background or context if necessary. State your request clearly.
o Take extra steps to minimize the email exchange: For example, if you are requesting
an appointment, state your purpose and name the times that you are available in your
initial message. Your respondent may then be able to answer you with only one
additional message.
o Quote selectively and briefly from any prior messages to provide context and
background. Although sometimes it's good to quote an entire exchange so as to keep a
record of what's been said and decided, often that's unnecessary and simply ends up
making a message too long and cluttering the screen.
o Finally, be respectful, and think about what kinds of things might sound odd or
offensive to your instructor.
Faulkner Press information
• WEBSITE: Use this link http://www.faulknerpress.com/universityGSU.shtml to register,
purchase, and download your courseware. ***Select Lauren Flynn as your instructor.
o MyAccount is your personal webpage in the Faulkner Media navigation system. You need
to create one the first time you access the website. This is where you will view and verify
your exam scores. If your score is posted here, it is also posted to the instructor’s online
grade book. If you do not see your score in your MyAccount, then contact Faulkner
Media for assistance.
o Helpful videos and tutorials on navigating this course are provided by Faulkner Media
and are highly recommended.
o Please note: this course does not primarily use iCollege or GSU technical services.
Everything is done through Faulkner Media, including all technical assistance. Grades will
be posted on iCollege.
• COURSEWARE. Software for this course (i.e., courseware) is downloaded from the website. A
description of the courseware can be found below in the section titled “Student Expectations
for Succeeding in this Online Course.”
o News & Events Tab: General class announcements, online exercise codes, and links to
web pages, are stored here. The messages are visible only through your Faulkner account
when you are online. (Located: Bottom left of courseware.)
o Presentation Tab: The course mini-lectures and accompanying slides and images are
located here. The presentation for each topic offers additional insights and examples to
enhance your understanding. (Located: Top left of courseware.)
o Reading Tab: The course text and readings are located in the Table of Contents. The
Table of Contents menu leads to the 12 topical areas (3 per section). (Located: Center of
courseware.)
o Assessment Tab: This component includes (a) Practice Choice Questions and interactive
games that you can use as part of your study and preparation and (b) the four online
exams. (Located: Top right of courseware.)
 Practice Choice Questions: Select this option from the Assessment menu to
access practice tests for each topic. A practice test consists of 10 items randomly
drawn from a pool of items based on the readings and lectures for a particular topic.
Each time you take a practice test, the items you answered correctly are removed
from the available practice test pool for that topic. The practice tests are not
required and are not submitted but are highly recommended as a study aid.
 Online Exams: Select this option from the Assessment menu to complete the four
online exams and submit your scores to the online grade book. An exam covers
one section (3-4 topics) of reading and lecture material. Approximately 50-70% of
the items on an exam are randomly drawn from the pools of practice questions
for the topics it covers. The other 30-50% are randomly drawn from a different
pool of questions that students do not see. Each exam is unique because 50 items
are randomly drawn from the hidden and practice question pools. Each online exam
is worth 100 points (400 points total) toward your final grade for the class.
Exams must be completed by the deadlines! There are no extensions, retakes,
or makeups offered without documentation of an acceptable emergency!
o Flash Drive: Your instructor recommends that you download the software onto your
personal computer AND onto a flash drive. As computers crash, viruses are transmitted,
personal technological devices are stolen, and internet become inaccessible, you should
download the software onto your personal computer and a flash drive, providing you
two options to access the course.
o Financial Aid Disbursements: If you are waiting on financial aid disbursements before
purchasing your courseware, please be advised, you may access a deferment demo on the
Faulkner Media site (www.faulknermedia.com) that will allow you to begin studying
without purchasing the courseware.
 Click on deferment demo in the menu at the top of the page and follow the
instructions.
 Make sure you select the deferment demo for Career and Lifespan Development.
 Please be advised that the deferment demo option allows you to access the first 3
topics of the courseware for study purposes only. You must purchase and register
the courseware to continue with the other topics and complete the exams.
o Faulkner Media Courseware Refunds: (for students who drop/withdraw from the
course): Faulkner Media has agreed to issue refunds for purchased courseware to any
student who drops the course within the first week of classes AND emails the Faulkner
Help desk during the first week of classes, requesting the refund for their courseware. All
withdrawn students are encouraged to seek a refund from Faulkner Media, but they should
know that they might not qualify.

SONA Registration and FAQ
We use this system to maintain the number of research credits received. You will also receive
reminders or other announcements related to the research requirement through this system, so if you
are not registered then you will not get these emails. Register for an account immediately.
Regardless of which option you choose, it is very important that you register for an account through
SONA systems. To do so, please follow these instructions:
1. Visit this webpage: http://gsucps.sona-systems.com
2. In bottom left, click “request an account here.”
3. Create your own ID and password. Please use your GSU email. Don’t forget to include
@student.gsu.edu (not just @gsu.edu.)
4. If you are taking multiple CPS courses this semester, you only need one account in SONA to
manage your research participation.
Please DO NOT confuse the SONA webpage used by the Psych department courses for webpage
used by the CPS department. It is a separate webpage and you will not find CPS courses listed.
Again, the CPS SONA website is https://gsucps.sona-systems.com
Please note:
If you complete research opportunities for the psychology department
you WILL NOT receive any credit for your research participation.
A total of 50 points toward your final grade is earned by successfully completing some combination of
the research-related alternatives described above. Please note that you have to complete 4 credits of
research for EACH COURSE you are taking. Therefore, if you are taking 2 CPS online courses,
you have to complete 8 credits. If you are taking 3 CPS online courses, you have to complete 12
credits of research. If you are taking multiple CPS online courses or have taken CPS online courses in
prior semesters, surveys may be limited to you. Therefore, Research Alternative #2 may be the best
option for you to complete.
The remainder of this appendix contains a set of frequently asked questions related to SONA. If your
question is not covered in the FAQ document, then please contact the CPS SONA administrator at
cpssona@gmail.com.
SONA Frequently asked question
1. Do I need a separate account for each CPS class?
a. No. The system allows you to include multiple CPS courses and track the credit earned
for each class requirement. You can add multiple courses by selecting ""My Profile""
from the Main Menu. Select the ""Change Courses"" option under the list of existing
courses you are in. Select from the available list of courses while holding the ""Ctrl""
control key and update the changes.
2. Can I reassign credit from a previous semester course to a current semester course?
a. No. The credits do not transfer between semesters. At the end of each semester, the
credits are archived. You cannot reassign credit earned from a previous semester to a
currently enrolled course.
3. Can I reassign credits from one CPS course to another during the same semester?
a. Yes! You can reassign credit between courses that you are actively enrolled in the
present semester. See question 6 to learn how.
4. How do I apply credit from the General Survey to all my CPS classes?
a. Each part of the General Survey is worth 0.5 credit for 30 minutes of participation. You
can only apply earned credit toward one single course. If you are enrolled in multiple 
CPS courses, you may only apply the credit earned from the general survey to one of
the courses but not to all.
5. How do I assign credit from one course to another?
a. If you belong to multiple courses in the same semester, you may reassign a credit from
one course to another. To do this, simply use the ""Reassign"" link that appears when you
view your progress under ""My Schedule & Credits"" tab. The link appears under the
course entry for each item in your progress listing. You may not split a credit between
two courses, for example by assigning 2 credits of a 3-credit study to one course, and 1
credit from that study to another course.
6. How do I select multiple courses?
a. In the initial set up of the account, the ""Courses"" drop-box allows you to select multiple
courses by holding the ""Ctrl"" key while you select the courses. After the initial set up:
If you are trying to add another course, go to ""My Profile"" from the Main Menu. Select
the ""Change Courses"" option under the list of existing courses you are in. Select from
the available list of courses and update the changes.
7. I accidently selected the wrong instructor for my course. Is it possible to change the account to
the right instructor?
a. Go to ""Change Courses"" underneath your current course listing and remove the existing
course. Then add yourself to the correct course and instructor. Credits that were
assigned to the previous course will not be automatically reassigned to the new correct
course. You should receive a warning about this and taken to the page where you may
reassign your earned credits.
8. I completed a survey but have not received credit. Why?
a. Most surveys offered through SONA are set up to grant credit automatically once the
survey is complete. Some studies are set up so that the researcher manually enters the
credit within 48 hours once he or she verifies completion. Best thing to do is (a) make
sure you signed up for the study, (b) then complete the study through the end and
submit before exiting the survey, and (c) contact the SONA administrator for assistance
if you still haven't received credit.
9. I don't see Psych courses listed.
a. The Psych courses are not going to be listed in the Counseling & Psychological
Services (CPS) SONA site. To sign up for the GSU Psychology Research and Testing
Site go to http://gsu.SONA-systems.com and contact cpssona@gmail.com for
assistance with their department SONA site.
10. Is it necessary to take the General Survey for each CPS course this semester?
a. The General Survey is a prerequisite that must be completed before you can participate
in other research studies during the semester. Once the survey is completed one time
during the semester, you are allowed to sign up for other studies in SONA.
11. What does the general survey mean by providing three ""informants""?
a. Informants mean three people you know that would feel comfortable participating in a
separate survey, upon asking them. Once you provide the contact information for the 3
individuals, the researcher will contact them separately at a later time. The participant
does not receive credit for providing three informants. As noted in the syllabus, here's
how a student earns their 1 credit for the general survey: ""The first screen, titled
General Survey, involves a 30-minute survey at the beginning of the semester (.5
credits). You can earn an additional .5 credits if you complete a 10-minute follow-up
survey, titled General Survey Part II, towards the end of the semester. Thus, the general
survey is worth 1 credit total if you do both parts.""
12. I emailed the CPS SONA email address and received an un-deliverable message. What should
I do?
a. On rare occasions, students may experience this problem due to coping and pasting the
cpssona@gmail.com address into the address bar. If this is the case, type the email 
address directly into the address bar and see if it transmits. If you still experience
issues, forward the email to your instructor and request that they contact the SONA
Administrator and the CPS Online Course Coordinator directly. This will ensure a
timestamp of your correspondence. 
Appendix A: Additional Information on the Research Requirement
What if the student or researcher is unable to keep the appointment?
If a student is unable to make a participation time that he/she has signed up for, it is his/her
responsibility to notify the researcher via email or by telephone at least 24 hours in advance of the
scheduled time. Both the contact number and email address for each researcher are given on the page
for his/her study on the GSU Research Participation Pool website.
If the researcher cancels the appointment more than 24 hours in advance, the student will not
receive the research credit. If the appointment is cancelled within less than 24 hours, the student will
receive credit. In the event that a researcher is not present at the scheduled location and time and has
not cancelled the appointment, the student should notify his/her instructor within 24 hours.
Rights of the Students, Relative to the Requirements
1. Autonomy - Students are free to elect any of the alternatives listed in order to complete their
research requirement.
2. Informed Consent - Students who elect Alternative 1 are entitled to receive, before they
consent to participate, as much information as is needed for them to make an intelligent
decision as to whether or not to participate. Students should receive a print copy of the
informed consent agreement for each study in which they volunteer to participate.
3. Right to Withdraw - Students may drop out of any study at any time after showing up and
learning about the research and what their participation will entail. You will not earn credit
towards your research requirement for a study from which you withdraw.
4. Right to Respect and Dignity - Researchers will treat all students who volunteer to participate
in their projects with respect and dignity.
5. Debriefing - Students who elect Alternative 1 will receive an explanation from the researcher
regarding the purpose of the study and the role that the student played in it. In some cases, this
explanation may be postponed until after the student's participation in the research is complete,
so as not to affect the student's behavior during the study.
6. Recourse - If a student feels that his/her rights have been violated, or that he/she has been
treated unfairly or in any other way harmed by means of participation in research, he/she
should register a complaint with one of the following individuals:
a. his/her course instructor
b. the CPS undergraduate course coordinator, Jo Saint, Ed.S. (msaint1@gsu.edu)
c. the Counseling and Psychological Services Department Chair, Brian Dew, Ph.D.
(bdew@gsu.edu).

APPROACHES TO GLOBAL HISTORY: SEMINAR
PROFESSORS SVEN BECKERT AND SUGATA BOSE
Alternate Mondays, 4–6 pm, fall and spring semesters 2017-18
Lower Level Library, Robinson Hall, 35 Quincy Street
Global History — the search to understand how human societies have developed as an
interactive community across the world—has come into its own as a scholarly enterprise
at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Spurred by ongoing processes of
globalization, drawing on students and researchers better trained in languages and social
science methods than ever before, it flourishes as one of the most important
developments in the discipline of history today. Examining processes, networks,
identities and events that cross the boundaries of modern nation states, this venture to
push the study of the past, remote and recent, beyond the compartmentalized approach
most older historians grew up with has mobilized scholars in faculties and research
centers across the world.
This seminar will introduce students to the literature on and practice of global history
today. Toward that end, the graduate-faculty research seminar is structured to bring
together interested faculty and students on a continuing basis. The course will include
both reading sessions designed for graduate students and research sessions during which
students and faculty participants will present current research. Faculty participants will be
drawn from a number of schools, and, most especially, from the group of fellows in
global history who are spending the academic year 2017/18 at the Weatherhead Initiative
on Global History. Students will be expected to write a research paper on a topic in
global history.
REQUIREMENTS
The course will consist of two parts. First, students will be expected to attend our biweekly meetings, where scholars interested in global history will present their works-inprogress. Active participation in these discussions is required, as is reading the main 
paper to be discussed and any background readings for these sessions. Students are
expected to deliver a formal comment on one of the papers to be presented by the guest
speakers. Second, students are expected to complete an article-length piece of writing,
based on original research and related to the theme of the course. To help guide such
research, the instructors will periodically schedule additional meetings with students who
are taking the course for credit.
Students who take the seminar for credit are expected to develop a topic for their research
on the following timeline. They should be ready to hand in a one-page proposal outlining
their topic, its significance, and their proposed methodology on October 9, 2017. These
will be discussed in small group meetings in the second half of October. By January 15,
2018 participants will submit an extended research proposal (5 pages) that explains their
research problem in some detail, discusses the relevant secondary literature, and lists the
(locally accessible) primary sources they will consult. The final draft of an article-length
paper is due on May 2, 2018. The final seminar session will offer an opportunity for
students to present their research to the wider group.
Readings will be available from the course website.
COLLABORATION POLICY STATEMENT
Discussion and the exchange of ideas are essential to academic work. For assignments in
this course, you are encouraged to consult with your classmates on the choice of paper
topics and to share sources. You may find it useful to discuss your chosen topic with your
peers, particularly if you are working on the same topic as a classmate. However, you
should ensure that any written work you submit for evaluation is the result of your own
research and writing and that it reflects your own approach to the topic. You must also
adhere to standard citation practices in this discipline and properly cite any books,
articles, websites, lectures, etc. that have helped you with your work. If you received any
help with your writing (feedback on drafts, etc.), you must also acknowledge this
assistance.

MACROECONOMIC POLICY FROM THE GREAT DEPRESSION TO TODAY
COURSE INFORMATION AND PROCEDURES
Course Description
The course will analyze current macroeconomic challenges and policy responses in the United States
through the lens of modern macroeconomics and economic history. It will include an in-depth look at
key macroeconomic policy issues, such as the impact of monetary and fiscal policy, and the causes and
effects of financial crises. The course is designed to build on the material in intermediate
macroeconomics, and will include both theoretical and empirical analysis. Three hours of lecture and
one hour of section per week. Prerequisites: Economics 100b or 101b.
Readings
The readings consist of scholarly journal articles, policy analyses, a few short textbook excerpts, and
cases. There is a large amount of reading and writing in this class, and the reading is required. The
readings are available from the following sources.
1. Links on Syllabus
Most readings are available online using the links below on the syllabus.
2. Textbook Readings on Course Webpage
There are a few short textbook excerpts from:
Mishkin, Frederic S. The economics of money, banking, and financial markets. Pearson education, 12th
Edition
These are available for download on the course webpage.
3. Purchasing Cases
Two cases must be purchased by clicking here:
https://www.thecasecentre.org/students/course/registerForCourse?ucc=C%2D2746%2D384231%2DSTU
Or alternatively by visiting:
https://www.thecasecentre.org/students/course/registerForCourse
and entering the CoursePack code C-2746-384231-STU. Note: you will be asked to register for
http://www.thecasecentre.org pay a fee of $10.50. Troubleshooting: Make sure to confirm your email
address. Also, you may see an hourglass for a couple of minutes before you can download the cases.
Refresh the page after 5 minutes.
Clickers: You are required to bring your clicker to each class, and I will ask several clicker questions in
each class session (you can only participate via clickers, and not smartphones etc.). Your participation in
these surveys will contribute to your participation grade (see below). For info on clickers, please see
Students Getting Started with Clickers.
1. Lectures: Lectures are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 to 11am in 50 Birge Hall. The
class will not be “webcast” via CourseCapture. If you can’t make the lectures, you should drop
the class.
2
Electronics Policy: It is course policy that phones and laptops are not to be used during lecture. You may
use tablets, only for the purpose of taking notes. Let me highlight two reasons for this policy. First, these
devices can be distracting to other students. Second, in my experience users of such devices in class
often suffer from a “self-control” problem. They intend to use them productively, but end up spending
more time than they anticipate checking email, social media, etc. and lose track of the flow of the
lecture.
Sections: There is one section per week that will be used to review the material and the written
assignments. The GSIs will put particular emphasis on reviewing material needed to do future written
assignments.
Enrollment: All enrollment question should be sent to the Department of Economics Head GSI, Preston
Mui, at headgsi@econ.berkeley.edu
Assignments and Grading
Written Assignments- 62%
• 7 written assignments. Assignment #1 worth 4% and all others worth 8% = 52%
• Additionally, 10% “flex points”. These will based on the average of your 3 best written
assignments.
Final- 30%
Clicker questions- 5%
• To get clicker question points for a particular lecture you must answer > 75% of clicker questions
in that lecture.
Section participation- 3%
This part of the grade will reflect the extent to which you contribute positively to your section.
Given the relatively small number of points at stake here, this will mainly matter for students on
the margin between one grade and another.
Important Notes on Written Assignments:
Written assignments are the primary assignment in this class. The typical question will require between
several sentences and several paragraphs of text, sometimes supplemented by figures. It is crucial to
submit your assignment in electronic form online in bCourses (in the same way you would submit an
essay) so that your submission can be analyzed using Turnitin. If you include hand-drawn graphs or
figures to accompany your written answers you should scan them and attach to the rest of your
submission. If you include graphs, be sure to label the axes and curves. The TA’s will select several of the
responses from each section for me to read for each assignment. I hope to have been able to read work
by many of you by the end of this class!
The due dates for the assignments may be found in the “Lecture and Assignment Schedule” also posted
on the bCourses website. Late assignments will incur a 20% penalty for being passed in beyond the due
date (by any amount) and an additional 10% per day for every additional day they are late. Typically, the
assignments are due at 10pm on either a Wednesday or a Friday. You should start submitting your
assignment significantly before the due date so as to avoid the (large) grading penalty associated with
late assignments. 
3
Writing and exposition are important, in addition to content. Longer answers are not necessarily
better. Points will be subtracted for incorrect statements, inconsistency within an answer, and
irrelevant material. Think carefully about what you write, and make your answers well organized, and
concise.
You may discuss general ideas with your classmates but you must write your own answers. All of your
submissions will be analyzed using Turnitin and plagiarism will not be tolerated.
Sample grading Rubric for written questions (out of 10 points)
4 points given if: The answer includes the basic information that is requested by the question.
3 points more if: The answer is exceptionally comprehensive, insightful or creative.
3 points more if: The answer is easy to read, to the point, and includes no incorrect or irrelevant
material.
Concerns about Grading
Any concerns regarding grading must be put in writing and given to the GSI in section within one week
from the date the graded assignment was returned to the class. Please be specific in describing why you
think there was a grading error, and why you believe you deserve significantly more points. Whenever a
request is made for a regrade, we will re-grade the entire assignment (not just the problem in question).
Frivolous requests for a regrade may, therefore, lead to a lower score on your assignment.
Instructor Contact Information and Office Hours
Professor Emi Nakamura, enakamura@berkeley.edu
685 Evans Hall
Office hours: Thursdays 11-12:30, 685 Evans

Slides, problem set and essay material will be posted on the bCourses website.
Academic Integrity
Berkeley Honor Code: The student community at U.C. Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code:
“As a member of the U.C. Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” I
expect all students and instructors to adhere to this code at all times.
Academic Honesty Policy: Cheating will be harshly punished. Cheating on a problem set will result in a
score of zero (0) on the assignment in question and a grade of “F” for the course if repeated. Cheating
on final exam will result in a grade of “F” for the course. Cheating includes, but is not limited to, violating
exam instructions, using written or electronic materials during an exam, copying off another person's
exam or assignment, allowing someone to copy off of your exam or assignment, having someone take
an exam or assignment for you, changing an exam answer after an exam is graded, and plagiarizing
written or other materials. Incidences of cheating are reported to Center for Student Conduct, which
administers additional punishment. See also http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/students/standards.
Fire Alarm Policy: Pulling of fire alarms is a crime, punishable by a fine and time in jail. In addition,
anyone caught pulling the alarm during a lecture or exam for this course is subject to expulsion from the
University, and will fail this course. If the alarm is pulled during an exam, the class will move outside and
finish the exam in the allotted time; in this event, follow the instructions of the GSIs.
4
Special Accommodations
If you require disability-related accommodations for exams or lecture, if you have emergency medical
information that you wish to share, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be
evacuated, please email or speak with your GSI as soon as possible. At least two (2) weeks before the
exam, you must also obtain a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) from Disabled Students' Program
(http://dsp.berkeley.edu, 260 César Chávez Center) which they send electronically to me and the GSI’s.
DSP’s Proctoring Service requires notice of participants at least two weeks in advance of an exam.
Accommodations are not offered retroactively.
Limits to Confidentiality:
As University of California employees, all course instructors are Responsible Employees and we are
required to report incidents and information provided to us about sexual violence, harassment, or other
conduct prohibited by university policy. We cannot keep such information confidential, but the Title IX
officer will consider requests for confidentiality. There are confidential resources available, including the
CARE Advocate Office (http://sa.berkeley.edu/dean/confidential-care-advocate).

1 Instructor and General Information
• Instructor: Professor Zvezdelina Stankova (Zvezda)
• Office: Evans 7132 • Phone: (510) 642-3768
• Tentative office hours (to be finalized within 2 weeks, changes on bCourses/my webpage):
• MWF 12:00-12:55pm (in “Yali’s Cafe”, Stanley Hall); MW 3:00-4:00pm (in Evans 713).
• There are no individual appointments.
• Questions will be answered on a first-come-first-serve basis.
• Administrative questions will take priority during the last 10 minutes of each office hours.
• If you have an urgent question, you must make time to come in office hours. The common
excuse: “I couldn’t make it to your office hours because of reason X, and hence I am writing to you
an email.” will not be accepted. If your issue is important, you will make time to come to office
hours. Anything that can be resolved in office hours must be resolved in office hours; not on email!
• Email: stankova@math.berkeley.edu; ONLY FOR EMERGENCIES!
• Webpage for ∀ Course Announcements:
• bCourses at https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/
• (just basics) http://www.math.berkeley.edu/∼stankova/
2 Electronics Policy in Class
No laptops, phones, or other electronic equipment can be used during lecture or discussion
sections. Electronic devices are distracting not just to the students using them, but they are also
detrimental to the class in general. Students who need to use a phone or other electronic device
for urgent matters must leave the classroom and use the devices outside of the classroom.
• Anyone using electronic devices during class will be asked to leave the classroom for 20 min.
• The only exceptions are for students with a disability that requires the usage of such equipment in class. Such students must explain the situation to the instructor and to the GSI, and
during lecture/section they may sit only in the first 3 rows or in specially designated seats that allow access to students with disabilities. Aids to students with disabilities may also use appropriate
electronics during class, after consultation with the instructor/GSI.
3 Enrollment, Section Switching, bCourse Access
3.1 For enrollment questions
Jennifer Sixt, Evans 967
• Drop-in office hrs (in person) M-F 9:30-12pm, 1-4pm.
• Brief questions may be also emailed to enrollment@math.berkeley.edu. During peak periods,
answering questions in person gets priority, instead of lengthy email exchanges with students.
2How to remember my office number and why come to office hours? Have you carefully read Harry Potter, Book 1?!
Vault 713 is a high security vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London, England. It is located hundreds of
miles underground and requires a Gringotts goblin to pass its finger along the length of the door, in order for
the door to melt away. It hosted the Philosopher’s Stone. Conclusion: there must be something very valuable in
Evans 713. Fortunately, you won’t need such a high security protocol to enter. Come to office hours!
2
3.2 For advising questions 5 DISCUSSION SECTIONS
• No access to enrollment: Do not ask the instructor or the GSI to switch you to another section
or to enroll you in the class. We have no control over enrollment in the class and in sections. To
switch discussion sections, students must go to https://calcentral.berkeley.edu The switch will
be possible only if there is room in the section.
3.2 For advising questions
Drop-in advising hrs (in person):
• Thomas Brown, Evans 965: M-F 10am-12pm, 1-5pm, 510-643-9292.
3.3 bCourses and Joining the Class Late
Only officially registered students in the class will gain access to bCourse materials.
As for students on the wait list, we will not add anyone to the class bCourse until the student:
• Has attended at least a week worth of sections,
• Has written at least one quiz in sections, and
• After receiving the quiz score, then asked the GSI to be added to bCourse.
Until then you need to:
• Ask a classmate to share with your any other materials on bCourses.
• Reasons that you do not know anyone on UCB campus will not be accepted. Make friends!
Follow these instructions precisely, and keep emails to me and the GSIs only for real emergencies.
Joining the class late and asking on email “How can I catch up with the class?” is not appropriate
and you will not get a response on email. You must come to OH in person with such questions.
However, keep in my that we will not drop more quizzes or HWs for students joining the class late.
4 Prerequisites
4.1 Required
• 3.5 years of high school math, including trigonometry and analytic geometry.
• Calculus AB in high school or MATH 10B.
• Even though MATH 10B precedes MATH 10B and is very useful in understanding MATH 10B
material, due to the split of the curriculum between 10B and 10B, one does not need, strictly
speaking, to have passed MATH 10B in order to enroll MATH 10B. In such a case, however, at
least prior Calculus AB in high school will be needed to do well in MATH 10B, as well as a lot of
motivation and dedication to the class.
5 Discussion Sections
5.1 Enrollment
Each student must sign up for a discussion section, meeting TTh.
5.2 Attendance
Discussion sections and lectures are mandatory.
3
8 READING ASSIGNMENTS
6 Textbooks
6.1 Required
• Stewart/Day–UC Berkeley, BioCalculus – Math 10 A,B - Methods of Mathematics: Calculus,
Statistics and Combinatorics, 9780357113387, 8/3/2018 c 2018 (custom edition).
• Rosen–UC Berkeley: Discrete Mathematics, 9781260836530. This is a custom edition.
6.2 Recommended:
“A Decade of the Berkeley Math Circle,” vol. I-II, edited by Stankova and Rike, MSRI/AMS, for
learning proofs and problem-solving techniques.
7 Homework
7.1 Assigned/Due
• HW will be posted on bCourses every week, usually right before or after each lecture. Thus,
usually there will be 3 HWs per week. These HWs must be completed by students by the following
Monday. HWs will be worth 3% of the final grade. HWs will be collected in sections (usually on
Tuesdays, unless specified otherwise). Give your HW to a classmate to turn it in if you are going
to miss a section (do NOT email it to the GSI). HWs won’t be graded. Each HW will be given a
score of 0-3 depending on completeness. The T/F questions in HWs will be launched on Webwork,
submitted and graded there.
• Absolutely no late HWs will be accepted, regardless of the reasons. After the deadline, the
solutions are posted on the internet, and hence it makes no sense for us to collect late HWs. Finally,
each HW is graded on “completion,” not “correctness”, and is worth about 0.08% (that is, 0.0008)
of the final grade. This is a most generous HW policy. It will not be broken for any reason. Keep
this in mind when you ask to submit a late HW and when your request is turned down.
• No HW adjustments will be made for students joining the class late.
7.2 If You Miss Lecture or Discussion Section
Do NOT e-mail instructor or GSI to ask for missed handouts and announcements. Instead, ask
your classmates.
7.3 Homework Solutions
• Posted: on bCourses ordinarily after the deadline for HW submission. Do not ask for solutions
to be posted earlier: you must attempt to do your homework without help from posted solutions.
• Taken down: from the web in a week or so after being posted; hence make sure that you
download them and read them on time. No HW solution files will be sent to students at any time:
please, do not request them; ask instead your classmates for those missed HW solution files.
8 Reading Assignments
It is the students’ responsibility to read carefully and thoroughly the assigned textbook section(s)
and review their class notes or other assigned materials after each class. If you miss class, do not
ask the instructor or the GSI for their notes. Ask your classmates for their notes.
4
9 QUIZZES
9 Quizzes
9.1 Total Number and Days of Quizzes
There will be about 13 or 14 quizzes in the sections, given on Tuesdays. If special circumstances
arise (e.g., power outage, important campus event, etc.) the instructor may occasionally change
the quiz date to Thursdays. So, watch out the announcements on bCourses for any rare occasional
changes in quiz date and definitely do NOT miss Thursday sections for any reason.
9.2 Number of quiz scores in final grade
Only the top 10 quiz scores will be taken into account when determining a student’s final grade.
9.3 No Make-up Quizzes
If you miss a discussion section when a quiz is taken, you cannot retake the quiz in another section,
and your quiz score will be 0.
Thus, when you miss discussion sections (for whatever reasons, including being sick, having
a family emergency, etc.), keep in mind that exactly the top ten quiz scores will be counted,
regardless of your reasons. No exceptions will be made to this policy: please, do not bring to me or
to your GSI notes to be excused from quizzes. The quizzes will be based on the current or previous
HW and class/section problems.
9.4 Purpose of the “Top 10 quizzes”
Keep the few times when you might miss quizzes only for true emergencies. The quizzes to be
dropped are not intended as a back-up for slacking off, lagging behind the material, or catching up
due to unsatisfactory academic performance on previous quizzes. The quizzes that will be dropped
are meant to help you in case of an emergency. No further quiz scores will be dropped.
9.5 Joining the Course Late and Quizzes
Again, 10 quiz scores will be used towards the final grade, including some possible 0s if fewer than
10 quizzes have been taken.
9.6 Content and Grading of Quizzes
Ordinarily, each quiz will be graded out of 12 points and will consist of one problem for 10 points
and 2 True/False questions, each graded as follows: 1 point for correct answer, 0 for blank, and -1
for incorrect answer. The T/F questions on the quizzes are intended to prepare you for a problem
with many T/F questions on each exam.
One of the T/F questions on each quiz may be on administrative matters reflected in the syllabus
or discussed in lecture or in section. Thus, you must read the syllabus and be updated on any
administrative announcements and discussions from lecture and sections.
9.7 Cheat Sheet on Quizzes
One page (one side of a regular sheet of paper), hand-written by the students. No copying and
pasting of typed text from anywhere, unless the student has a registered disability that allows for
typed or other specially prepared texts.
5
10 EXAMS
10 Exams
10.1 Time and Place of the Three Exams
LEC 002: 1pm - 2pm
Midterm 1: Monday, Feb 24, in class.
Midterm 2: Friday, April 3, in class.
Final exam: Tuesday, May 12, 8:00am-11:00am,
scheduled campus-wide.
LEC 002: 2pm - 3pm
Midterm 1: Monday, Feb 24, in class.
Midterm 2: Friday, April 3, in class.
Final exam: Tuesday, May 12, 11:30am-2:30pm,
scheduled campus-wide.
10.2 No make-up Midterms or Final Exams
Every student must take the midterms and the final exam on these dates and at these times. Do
NOT ask to take exams in the other 10B class: this will not be allowed. If you anyways do it, you
score will be recorded as 0. (Your exam scores must be weighted against the scores of your own
class, and hence such shifts are NOT possible.) Excuses like “I misread the schedule.” or “I had
an emergency.” will not be considered. No exceptions!
10.3 Scheduling or Avoiding Conflicts with Exams?
• Do not buy tickets to leave before or to come after an exam: you must be here at the three
exams dates above.
• Do not ask for earlier dates for the final exam due to flight reservations or other reasons: the
final exams times are assigned campus-wide and there will be no personal exceptions.
• Do not take this class if you have a conflict with any of this exam schedule.
• Exceptions are noted in a later section in this syllabus.
10.4 Exam Content
A substantial part of the exams will be based on versions of problems from:
• Homework: problems, both regular and bonus.
• Class: problems, theory, and ideas discussed in lecture and discussion sections.
• Quizzes: quiz problems from random sections.
10.5 Are the Exams Comprehensive?
• Midterms: The topics for each midterm exam will be based on the portion of the course between
exams. Thus, formally, midterms are not comprehensive. Yet, you cannot forget previous material
since parts of it may come up in the solutions to midterm problems.
• The final exam is comprehensive: Anything covered in the course is a fair game on the final
exam.
6
12 SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS
11 Grading
11.1 Grading scheme
Grades are computed by taking:
• 3% HW completion. Each written HW is given a score of 0-9 based on completion and
timely submission in Tuesday’s sections. The WebWork T/F question section is given a score of 1
if submitted by the deadline of Monday 11:59 pm AND at least half of the questions are correctly
answered. Each WebWork HW will be worth about 0.1 of 0.08% (that is, 0.00008). Thus, don’t
make a big deal of it and don’t ask for exceptions due to late submissions or other reasons.
• 12% quizzes (using only the top 10 quiz scores). Quiz medians of all sections in the class will
be uniformized at the end. Thus, there is no point of being upset that your section is getting harder
quizzes or is being graded harsher: it won’t make a difference in the end. In fact, you will be better
prepared for the final exam by the harder quizzes and your quiz score will not be affected by that.
• 25% each midterm.
• 35% final exam.
• It is up to the instructor to decide if some or all of three exams will be rescaled in the end to
the same median, so as to give them comparable weights in the final grade.
11.2 Resurrection Final
The final exam score will override any lower midterm score, if and after all or some of the three
exams have been rescaled to the same class median. This means that:
• The final exam may count as 60% or 85% instead of 35% of the final grade.
11.3 Class Curve
• The final letter grades will be based on a curve, which is not pre-determined.
• Class statistics on the midterms and the final exam will be posted on bCourses.
11.4 Missing the Final Exam
Missing the Final Exam will result in automatic failure of the course, unless valid reasons (as per
university rules) are provided for requesting an incomplete grade (see below).
12 Special Accommodations
12.1 Skipping a Midterm
You may skip a midterm (but not the final exam!) due to a conflict with religious creed, an
extra-curricular/sports activity, or a family/medical emergency.
• The student must notify the GSI that he/she will be skipping a midterm and explain the reason,
so that the GSI does not worry about what happened. No need for a formal documentation.
• The final exam will resurrect the missed midterm. However, this option must be taken only
when really necessary. Frivolous skipping a midterm usually leads to a poorfinal exam outcome.
• It is the student’s responsibility to learn the missed material due to the absence.
7
12.2 DSP Arrangements 13 INCOMPLETE GRADES
12.2 Special Arrangements for Disabled Student Program (DSP) students
• If you are a student with a disability registered by the DSP on UCB campus and require
special arrangements during exams and quizzes, I must be sent the official DSP accommodation by
the DSP office at least 14 days (2 weeks) in advance. We will likely not be able to accommodate
anyone in less than 14 days and the student will have to take the exam (or quiz) along with everyone
else under the regular conditions provided for the class. The earlier we are informed about your
DSP status, the easier it is to provide appropriate accommodations for you.
• Do NOT ask to be given special accommodations while promising that in the future you will
provide a DSP note. Observe this policy: no exceptions will be made.
12.3 Taking the Final Exam “On the Road” for Athletes
• If you have a scheduled athletic competition as a member of an official UCB sports activity during
the final exam, you must inform the instructor at least 14 days prior to the final exam.
• Final exams “on the road” are not automatically granted: certain conditions must be satisfied
and the instructor needs to speak with your coach who will be with you to proctor the exam. Thus,
if you do not inform the instructor at least 14 days prior to the final exam, you will not be granted
the privilege of taking the final exams under such special conditions. Take this seriously and act
fast and responsibly to ensure that communication has reached the instructor by the deadline.
13 Incomplete Grades
13.1 University Policies
Please, consult the university policies regarding incomplete grades.
13.2 Reasons for Incomplete
An Incomplete “I” grade is rarely given. The only justifications for an I grade are:
• documented serious medical problem, or
• a genuine personal/family emergency.
13.3 Conditions for Giving an Incomplete
When requesting an incomplete, the student must:
• have a passing grade (C- or above) up to that point in the class.
• have completed at least 2/3 of the course work up to that point.
• present a formal document regarding the nature of emergency or the medical problem.
13.4 Invalid Reasons for Requesting an Incomplete
• Falling behind in this course or a heavy work load in other courses are not acceptable reasons
for requesting an incomplete.
• If you miss a midterm (for whatever reasons), you will very likely not qualify for an incomplete,
as your grade before the final exam will include a 0 on that midterm, which will not have been
“resurrected” by the final at the time of requesting the incomplete grade.
8
15 ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
14 Drop Deadline
The results of the first midterm will likely be known after the drop deadline. Do not ask me or
the GSIs if we think you are more likely to get, say, B− instead of C+: we will not know. The
decision to drop the course will be entirely yours and you will have to make it based on your first
several quizzes and the first midterm (if its score is available at that point).
15 Academic Integrity
The Mathematics Department, and in particular, the instructor and the GSIs in this course, expect
that students in mathematics courses will not engage in cheating or plagiarism. The following is
adapted from the Math Dept web page to our course.
15.1 What does Cheating Mean?
Broadly speaking, cheating means violating the policies of a course or of the university in order to
gain an unfair advantage over fellow students. A particular kind of cheating is plagiarism, which
means taking credit for someone else’s work. Cheating and plagiarism hurt your fellow students in
the short term, they hurt the cheater in the long term, and they will not be tolerated. On exams,
the most basic type of cheating is copying off of someone else’s paper. Graders easily spot when two
exam papers look unusually similar, or have similar (wrong or correct) answers, calculations, ideas,
or thought structure, even if written in different words or order of words. Even glancing at someone
else’s paper to check your answer is cheating. If you write the correct answer to a computational
problem without any justification or with a bogus justification leading to that answer, this raises
strong suspicions that you cheated, on top of not receiving any credit anyways due to the lack of
correct justification.
15.2 Electronic Devices on Exams/Quizzes
Electronic devices such as phones, ipads, calculators (electronic, mechanical, or any other type), and
other devices, are also not allowed on exams/quizzes (unless explicitly allowed by the instructor),
not even to tell the time. There are too many ways to cheat using software and the Internet. Exams
are not intended to test your ability to find the answer by any means necessary. The questions
might be too easy for that! Rather, exams/quizzes are supposed to test your understanding of the
course material, which you will need in order to use math correctly in subsequent courses and in
the real world.
15.3 Expectations on Exams, Quizzes, and HW
Exams and quiz papers are expected to be your own work. In this class we encourage collaboration
on homework, as it won’t be graded or collected; but you are carrying your personal responsibility
to learn how to do the HW problems independently so as to be able to solve similar problems on
exams and quizzes by yourself. When allowed, if you use proofs or calculations from textbooks or
class notes, you need to cite these sources, even if you have rewritten the material in your own
words; otherwise it is plagiarism.
9
15.4 How to Avoid Cheating? 16 DISRUPTED EXAMINATIONS
15.4 How to Avoid Cheating?
It is your responsibility to take reasonable precautions to prevent cheating. In exams, you should
sit as far away from other students as the room permits, and hold your exam papers in such a way
that they are not easily visible to other students.
15.5 What to Do in a Case of Cheating?
If you suspect that other students are cheating, you should immediately inform the instructor
and/or your GSIs. Students may be cheating in ways that the instructor/GSI has never even
heard of (unlikely, but possible). Even if you don’t mention any names, the sooner you inform the
instructor/GSI what is going on, the sooner they can take measures to put a stop to it. You can
further report any cheating at:
http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/reporting/academic
15.6 Resolution to Cheating
If you are suspected of cheating, the instructor may pursue a variety of actions depending on the
particular nature of the incident. If you accept responsibility for academic miscondict, the matter
can often be resolved between you and the instructor with possible academic sanctions ranging from
losing points on an exam/quiz to failing the class, and a report will be sent to the Mathematics
Department and/or Center for Student Conduct. It is not necessary for the instructor to determine
whether the student(s) has a passing knowledge of the relevant factual material. It is understood
that any student who knowingly aids in cheating is as guilty as the cheating student.
In serious incidents, or if you maintain that you are not responsible for academic misconduct, the
instructor has the freedom and responsibility to impose any academic sanctions within the course
that she deems appropriate, and the case will very likely be forwarded to the Center for Student
Conduct. In such a case, more stringent actions (e.g., dismissing the student from the university)
can be initiated by the Office of Student Conduct.
15.7 Conclusion
We hope that the above clarifications will help prevent cheating. If you have any questions about
the rules or expectations, you should not hesitate to ask the instructor/GSI, or the vice chair for
undergraduate affairs in the Mathematics Department.
16 Disrupted Examinations
The following has been adapted from the Mathematics Department advising materials to faculty.
16.1 State Law during Fire Alarms
Over the years, several final examinations have been disrupted by false fire alarms. State law
requires that buildings must be evacuated during alarms, and the police department suggests that
classes do so in an orderly, efficient fashion so that students can return to work as quickly as
possible.
10
16.2 Penalties for False Alarms 17 ILLEGAL POSTINGS
16.2 Penalties for False Alarms
A false alarm is a misdemeanor, with a penalty of up to $1,000 in fines and up to one year in county
jail. If the alarm results in bodily injury (e.g., someone has a heart attack), a false alarm can be a
felony with a penalty up to $5,000 in fines and three years in state prison.
16.3 When an Alarm does Sound during an Exam
When an alarm does sound during an exam, we will use the following guidelines:
• If an alarm is pulled after the exam has been going on for more than 2/3 of the overall allotted
time, the exam will be considered complete and the grading scale will be adjusted accordingly at
the discretion of the instructor.
• If an alarm has been pulled after the exam has been going on for less than 15 minutes, we will
evacuate and the students will leave the exams on their desks. After the alarm has been taken care
of, the students will proceed back to the classroom and resume the exam. Anyone found carrying
his/her exam outside the classroom will not be allowed to continue the exam, and the instructor
will be given the freedom to decide how and whether to grade this student’s exam.
• During an evacuation, the instructor and the GSIs will visibly monitor the students to cut down
on casual exchanges of exam information.
• For exams that have been going on between 15 minutes and less than 2/3 of the total allotted
time, the students will leave their papers in the classroom and evacuate. It will be up to the
instructor to decide if there is enough time to resume the exam or to reschedule it.
17 Conduct Sanctions and Grade Deductions for Illegal Postings
This section concerns what will happen when a student pirates course materials and posts them
on-line, including but not limited to coursehero.com, or assists someone else in doing that. Apparently, the problem is pervasive, it encourages plagiarism, and in the long-run it hurts everyone by
undermining and jeopardizing their learning process.
Here are the relevant sections from the University-wide Code of Conduct and this is what
UCB Student Conduct Committee will use to apply sanctions to students who have posted
course materials on-line or elsewhere without explicit permission from the corresponding instructors:
• 102.23 Course Materials - Selling, preparing, or distributing for any commercial
purpose course lecture notes or video or audio recordings of any course unless
authorized by the University in advance and explicitly permitted by the course
instructor in writing. The unauthorized sale or commercial distribution of course
notes or recordings by a student is a violation of this Code whether or not it was
the student or someone else who prepared the notes or recordings.
Copying for any commercial purpose handouts, readers or other course materials
provided by an instructor as part of a University of California course unless
authorized by the University in advance and explicitly permitted by the course
instructor or the copyright holder in writing (if the instructor is not the copyright
holder).
11
18 MORE LEARNING RESOURCES
As in other classes on campus, any unauthorized by me postings of any course materials, including
but not limited to any handouts, syllabus, bCourse pages, quizzes, discussion worksheets, midterm
reviews, exams, presentations, lecture notes, pictures, video, etc., will be:
• Subject to a letter grade deduction of the final course grade, left entirely to the
instructor’s discretion, AND
• Formally reported to the University Student Conduct Committee.
I had never felt the need to impose such strict rules until I was given the opportunity to see the
damage that such mis-conduct causes to all students in classes on campus and elsewhere.
In case of doubt, before posting any materials related to the course, ask me or your GSIs. As a
rule of thumb, anything that I or the GSIs have prepared for the course, anything on the bCourses
site, etc., CANNOT be posted on-line. Be advised that there is a simple way to track down who
has posted materials.
Finally, no one in the classes can take audio or video, or pictures of the boards or anyone in class,
without my explicit permission and without the corresponding DSP accommodation presented to
me in advance. Such audio, video, or picture materials are subject to the same rules of non-posting
and usage strictly by the corresponding DSP student.

• Description: MATH 98 Adjunct for Math 10B is a 1-unit course offered by the Student Learning
Center and taken in conjunction with Math 10B. MATH 98 integrates academic content from Math
10B with study strategies, exam preparation and critical reading techniques. The provided worksheets, practice quizzes, and review assignments are designed to improve students’ problem-solving
ability, test-taking skills, and study strategies in order to enhance engagement and performance in
MATH 10B.
• All sections are open to any Math 10B student, regardless of which particular lecture they are
enrolled in. If you are interested in enrolling in the Adjunct, you must enroll or be on the waiting
list of the lecture that the Adjunct course is supporting. In order to enroll, you must attend the
first meeting or contact the instructor by the day of the first meeting. The instructor distributes
the course number to all students who have shown commitment to the course by the end of the
Adjustment Period. This allows you to check out the Adjunct before you fully commit. Please note
that enrollment is limited to 25 students, so students must attend the first meeting or contact the
instructor by the day of the first meeting.
18.2 No Piazza This Semester for MATH 10B
The MATH 10A-10B students rarely used the piazza site for the past 3 semesters. Thus, it will be
a more efficient use of the GSI’s time to complete other tasks related to the course.

• Any student is welcome to visit any GSI (from either class) with math questions. The GSIs’
and instructor’s office hours do not overlap, and hence there are lots of office hours during the week
when one can get answers to questions. You do not have to come to the instructor’s office hours
with math questions: all GSIs are qualified to answer math questions related to the course.
• Direct admin. questions (not answered in class) in person to your GSI or the instructor.
• Reserve email for emergencies only! “Emergencies” are urgent and important situations
that are not caused by a student’s procrastination, negligence, or disorganization. Yes, this is
repeated, as a number of students ignore this and send all sorts of routine or non-emergency emails
that can be resolved in office hours.
• Be organized, responsible, and hard-working: these traits will take you half of the way to
performing well and getting a lot out of this course.

This course covers policy issues related to education in developing contexts. We will analyze education
policies and reforms, develop skills to be a critical consumer of relevant research on each topic, and
examine implications of the findings to policy and practice. Topics include discrimination and inclusion
in education, understanding factors that influence educational decisions, provision of basic needs in
schools, teacher pay and incentives, education in emergency settings, and school choice.
Prerequisites: Tools of microeconomic theory and econometric analysis will be used. Students lacking
these prerequisites should seek permission from the instructor.
Readings and guest speakers
Readings. Many of the issues discussed in the course would benefit from the perspective of multiple
disciplines. However, much of the emerging causal evidence on education in developing countries comes
from the field of development economics, and therefore, the reading list of the course is composed mainly
of studies that use economic tools to analyze educational issues. These articles can be found through the
University of Chicago library system or through the course reserves link on Canvas. Useful resources in 
Education and Development ▪ Adukia Winter 2022
The University of Chicago 2
understanding some of the methods used in the readings include: Mostly Harmless Econometrics by
Angrist and Pischke or Methods Matter: Improving Causal Inference in Educational and Social Science
Research by Murnane and Willett. Students may also find useful: Running Randomized Evaluations
by Glennerster and Takavarasha and Failing in the Field by Karlan and Appel. These are on reserve at
Regenstein Library.
Guest speakers. Guest speakers will often join us at the beginning of each class, typically via
videoconference. They will often request that students prepare materials in addition to the readings listed
for the course, which will also be announced ahead of time. The schedule may change as we go, and the
instructor will announce adjustments accordingly. Speakers spend their valuable time to visit the class
whether in person or virtually, so it is very important that students remain engaged during their visits.
Requirements, assignments, and grading
Grades will be based on regular attendance and active class participation including submission of weekly
discussion questions (30%), leading a class presentation and discussion (30%), and a final project
consisting of two project proposals, a presentation, and a final paper (40%).
Deadlines are as follows:
❑ Student survey (online at Canvas): Please fill out by January 4 at 12 pm.
❑ Discussion questions: Due by noon on Canvas the day before class (4 classes)
❑ In-class presentation: Meet with instructor one week before class, give presentation in class, and
submit final slides and short report (contributions and references) by 12 pm the day after class.
❑ Final project: 2 project proposals due by noon January 18, first draft of proposal by February 10, peer
review by February 17, oral presentation on February 28, written paper due March 4.
Class participation, including attendance and discussion questions (30%)
Active engagement and reflection are essential requirements for this course. Students are expected to
contribute substantively to class discussions. The quality of participation is just as important as the
quantity. Class participation grades will be based on questions and comments students pose in class and
on the weekly discussion questions. Disengagement from the class will count against the participation
component of your grade. Students will be cold-called in class at times. Students must also be on time for
class, especially when we have a guest speaker; otherwise, it may count against one’s grade.
Discussion Questions. For a minimum of four of the weeks in the term, students are expected to submit
three discussion questions for the week’s readings by 12:00 pm on the day before the class meets
(Sunday) on Canvas. Two of the questions should be about the readings themselves, and one of the
questions should be a question that the readings left you with and an idea of a way to study it. If a student
submits discussion questions for more than four of the class sessions, only the highest four grades will be
counted. Students should not duplicate questions asked by other students.
Attendance. Students who miss one class should email the instructor before missing the class and will be
responsible for writing a two-page paper in response to two of the assigned readings for the week. A
report should address the following questions:
▪ What are the questions being addressed by this study? Why do these questions matter?
▪ What are the answers offered by the study?
▪ What evidence is brought to bear?
▪ In your view, does the evidence compellingly support the conclusion of the study? Why or why not?
▪ Can you propose a better way to study or address the same question?
Education and Development ▪ Adukia Winter 2022
The University of Chicago 3
If students miss more than one class, they must see the instructor. These reports (no longer than 2 pages)
should be posted to the Canvas website by 11:59 pm Tuesday, the day after class. Students can not miss
the last class on February 28.
Weekly in-class presentations (30%)
Groups will be assigned based on student preference indicated in the student survey. If a given topic has
more interest than available slots, we will assign students randomly.
Presentation/discussion facilitation. In addition to general class participation, each student will make an
in-class presentation as part of a small group. Your group’s objective is to research an historical aspect of
the topic of the day, make an informative presentation to teach your classmates about this aspect, and
foster discussion on the topic. Presentations are limited to 20 minutes total. After the presentation, the
group will have ten minutes to lead a discussion directly related to the cases.
Some requirements to keep in mind:
▪ Meeting with the instructor: At least one week before the presentation, a majority of the group should
meet with the instructor to discuss their specific lecture and possible presentation topics. Afterwards,
the group should email Prof. Adukia to confirm the selected historical case and general plan for the
presentation.
▪ Complete the research on the historical aspect. Prioritize your main points and produce a polished
draft of the presentation. The basic organization of most presentations should be: (a) give context, (b)
describe the historical aspect, (c) connect it to the academic literature and how it is relevant to
understanding the topic of the day, (d) discuss the effects and implications in the modern-day world.
Students should be sure to present the material in a clear, thought-provoking manner.
▪ After the presentation, submit a final version of the slides and a bibliography that includes complete
citations of the sources used using APA format and other supporting materials (if relevant). Each
group member should submit a brief description of how each group member contributed. These items
are due via Canvas by noon the day after the presentation.
This part of the grade is based on the following criteria:
▪ Ability to develop a presentation related to the issue of the day and visually and clearly convey
the material in an informative manner (e.g., using slides).
▪ Delivery of the presentation in class with the goals of teaching your classmates about the cases
and highlighting key facts and issues
▪ Ability to facilitate a discussion of thoughtful questions and to foster quality class participation
▪ The quality of general class participation will also be taken into account and may result in altering
your presentation grade either up or down
Please name the files using the following naming convention: “lastname1_lastname2
_lastname3_topic_w22.” For example: for the group presentation slides on the first week of classes with
group members Maria Adelaida Martinez Cabrera and Emileigh Harrison, you would name the file:
“Cabrera_ Harrison_Why_Schools_W22.”
Final project (40%)
For the final project, students will design, present, and write an original evidence-based (1) business idea,
(2) policy proposal, or (3) research proposal designed to improve educational outcomes. The specific
topic is open-ended, allowing students to explore a question that is most suited to their interests, skills,
and career interests. This will be done in self-selected groups of three or more people.
The final project will be comprised of a few components:
❑ 2 one-page project proposals (due January 18, 12pm)
Education and Development ▪ Adukia Winter 2022
The University of Chicago 4
❑ First draft of your group’s proposal (due February 10, 12pm)
❑ Peer review first draft (due February 17, 12pm)
❑ A presentation to be delivered during the last class session (due February 28, in-class)
❑ A jointly-authored, 12-15-page document (not including references) and an individual
contribution statement (due March 4, 12pm)
Topic Proposals. The 2 one-page project proposals should include:
▪ Who is the audience for your proposal? Who would be the ideal recipient/reader of your project?
▪ Is it a policy proposal, business proposal, or research proposal?
▪ What's the bigger issue you want to address? What's the specific question/part of the issue you
wish to address?
▪ For which content, for which population?
▪ How do you propose to address it?
▪ Why do you think this might be an effective strategy/the best way to approach the issue (cite
some evidence that your proposal has promise)?
First Draft. You will complete a comprehensive first draft of your proposal. Your classmates will need
this for peer review, so be sure to complete it on time.
Peer review. Each group member will be assigned to individually peer review another group’s proposal.
These should provide comprehensive feedback which both provides bigger picture perspectives (what is
the contribution of this proposal, what are the strengths and areas for improvement, are there any gaps in
the logic or proposal, helping the group see the forest from the trees, checking that enough information is
included such that all parts of the proposal make sense and are easily understood such as pointing out
where things need to be clearer or more concrete, where they need to link point A to point B, whether
they need to include a better rationale for their idea, etc.) in addition to more detailed feedback about
specific ways they can improve the proposal and copyediting,
Final Class Presentation. Students will present their proposals to their classmates in the final class
session. Students should meet with Prof. Adukia and the TA at least one week prior to the presentation
itself. The presentation should be directed at a specific audience (e.g. a minister of education, a
foundation funding youth programs, a venture capitalist supporting non-profit organizations, a research
organizations, etc.). All assertions on slides should be cited using APA format. Students will also
provide feedback to their peers on their presentations during the class period. The final set of slides and a
bibliography in APA format should be posted to Canvas under the relevant Discussion thread by the start
of class that Monday.
Final Proposal. One group member should submit the final proposal to Canvas. Each group member
should also individually submit a note about the contributions of each of the group members (including
themselves) for each component of the final project.
Students should consider the following when crafting their proposals and presentations:
▪ Do you think that this proposal could help in solving the larger issue? Is this an interesting and
promising idea?
▪ What is the quality of the proposal and analysis?
▪ What role does evidence play in supporting the different components?
▪ How well is the information communicated?
▪ If you were the target audience member (minister of education, grant officer at a foundation,
venture capitalist, etc.), would you support this proposal? Why or why not? What more would
you need or want to know?

Disclaimer. The information in this syllabus is current, as of October 16, 2019. I reserve the right to
change anything in here, at any time. If it’s important, I’ll announce it in class.
Course Description. The course will teach calculus. This quarter will emphasize the beginning concepts,
and move through differentiation. For the textbook, see Chapters 1-4 to get an idea.
The course is not “proof-based”, but is rather meant to be a calculus course that appeals to the general
public. That being said, the course will emphasize mathematical thinking in general: we will use calculus to
learn how mathematicians approach problems. Everything in math is a proof, so students will be expected
to produce proofs related to the class, and the course will cover many proofs. As an example of this for
first quarter, we will explicitly cover both induction and δ-ε proofs (as should every section of 151). Finally,
many results we will learn are foundational and assumed knowledge in many disciplines; thus, occassional
applications will be covered. These will mostly be explored in homework. As specific goals, I have:
• Students should be able to explain the intuition behind limits, continuity, and differentiation.
• Students should be able to replicate precise definitions of these terms, as well as important theorems.
• Students should be able to produce an ε-δ proof.
• Students should be able to differentiate sums, products, and compositions of standard functions.
• Students should be able to graph a general function based off information on its derivatives.
• Students should be able to apply their understanding to novel situations; perhaps most relevantly,
students should be able to apply their understanding of derivatives to real-life situations.
• Students should be able to write and communicate mathematical content in a clear, concise, and
grammatically correct manner.
Homework. New problems will be assigned over the course of the week. They will be posted on the course
website as a pdf.

2 CALCULUS I MATH 15100 – SECTION 13 – FALL 2019
There is a VCA, Huayue Xue, who grades the homework. Thus any questions or concerns specifically
about grading should be addressed to this VCA. The VCA reserves the right to deduct points for sloppy or
unclear work on any of the problems.
Although homework may contribute little to your final grade, it will greatly aid in problem-solving and
learning the material. Additionally, some exam questions will likely be similar to homework problems, and
thus the homework serves as a good study guide for the exams.
Homework will be due on Wednesday, at the start of the class; you will be allowed two late homeworks.
Late homework should be turned in the next class day (again, at the start of class). There is one obvious
exception, of the last homework (which is due on the last day of class, so there are no extensions).
You may always turn in homework early. Homework may also be turned into my mailbox (in the basement
of Eckhart), as long as it is significantly before class (i.e., I pick up the homeworks when I leave my office
to come to class, so your homework better be there before I pick them up). You may also email me a pdf of
your homework, but I prefer a printed copy.
Academic Dishonesty. To be proper, you should cite sources as appropriate (this includes citing other
students). You are encouraged to discuss problems or use other soursces.
Note that academic dishonesty will not be tolerated: in particular, homework should be your own work.
Problem Session. There will be a weekly problem session, on T 6:00 – 7:00pm. Mostly, we will workshop
problems similar to homework, or that I find interesting.
Lecture. I don’t care if you attend lecture, and I don’t care if you don’t pay attention in lecture. I ask
that if you plan on doing something distracting during lecture (e.g., facebook, watching Netflix), that you
sit towards the back so as to not distract other students. Similarly, no excessive noise.
Office Hours. Come to them to ask me questions, so I won’t be bored.
If you are unable to attend my established office hours, feel free to email me to schedule an appointment.
Midterms: There will be two midterms in class, on October 25 and November 13. All exams are closed
book, closed note, individual, timed exams. Exams are always “cumulative”. These exams occur during the
normal class time.
Attendance is mandatory at midterms, to the extent that they are a significant portion of your grade.
You will have an opportunity to submit midterm corrections, to receive half your points back. These will
be graded more harshly than the actual exam, but your grade may never decrease. These will be due the
Monday after exams are returned (again, before class).
Final Exam. There will be a two hour exam on Wednesday, December 11, 8:00am – 10:00am, in the same
room as class. The date and time of the exam is set by the University. It is the policy of the Department of
Mathematics that the following rules apply to final exams in all undergraduate mathematics courses:
• The final exam must occur at the time and place designated on the College Final Exam Schedule.
In particular no final examations may be given during the tenth week of the quarter, except in the
case of graduating seniors.
• Instructors are not permitted to excuse students from the scheduled time of the final exam except
in the case of an Incomplete.
Grades. There is no predetermined method of determining letter grades. I will establish at the end of the
quarter a monotonic function from the numeric grade in the course, to the A-F system.
If you ever have questions about how you are doing in the course, we may discuss this in office hours.
Note that the handwavy nature of the grading system is to your benefit. For example, if you tanked the
first midterm, but then aced the second and the final, I would feel bad giving you a lower grade. Now I don’t
have to, since I didn’t lock in a grading system.
Special Circumstances. Please contact me, at your earliest convenience, if you would like appropriate
arrangements because you
• require accomodations for a disability,
• are taking this course in order to finish an Incomplete, or
• will be graduating at the end of this quarter.",,,,

Course Description
We do not have complete control over our lives. Our plans can be upset by chance and
disaster. We depend upon other people, and they depend on us. We are limited creatures
who are often unable to achieve what we want. Ultimately, we all die. Is it possible to be
happy in this life? Is this world just? If we're not happy is that unjust? If the world isn’t just,
can we be? This course examines ancient thought about death, chance, happiness, and
justice.

Assignments
Your work for this course will consist of three papers. Each paper is to be 5 pages long.
Paper topics will be suggested. You are not required to write on one of the suggested topics.
However, if you do not choose to write on one of the suggested topics, you must meet with
either the instructor or the writing intern and have your topic approved. Furthermore, if you
decide to devise your own paper topic, your paper must have the following format: a close
reading of a line, a sentence, a few sentences, or at most a paragraph from one of the texts
we have discussed in class. In no case, whether you are writing on an assigned topic or
on a topic of your own, may you make use of any texts or materials other than ones
we have discussed in class.
You are welcome to submit your papers by email; please send them both to the
instructor and to the writing intern. If you are not submitting your paper by email, then
please submit two copies to the instructor's mailbox in Classics 17. Papers are due by
5:00pm on the days indicated on the schedule.
1
Grading
Each of your papers will be read by both the instructor and the writing intern. Your grade is,
however, ultimately the responsibility of the instructor. If you have a question about your
grade please speak to him.
Your grade for the course will be determined by your grades on the three papers according
to the following formula:
First paper: 30%
Second paper: 30%
Third paper: 40%
You will be given both a number grade and a letter grade for each paper. Only the numerical
grade is taken into account in determining your final grade. Numerical grades correspond to
letter grades as follows:
A 10.0-9.5
A- 9.4-9.0
B+ 8.9-8.7
B 8.6-8.3
B- 8.2-8.0
C 7.9 or below
Participation both in class and in the writing section is required, but is not graded.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism is strictly forbidden: the writing and the argument of your paper must be your
own. If I suspect that you have violated the University's honor code, I will discuss the matter
with you privately and decide based on our conversation whether it needs to be reported to
the College authorities. If you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism, please
do not hesitate to ask either the instructor or the writing intern.

Course	Overview
Language	is	at	the	center	of	what	it	means	to	be	human	and	is	instrumental	in	all	humanistic	pursuits.	
With	it,	we	understand	others,	persuade,	argue,	reason,	and	think.	This	course	aims	to	provoke	critical	
examination	of common	assumptions	that	determine	our	understanding	of	language,	texts,	and	the	ways	
language	is	used	and	understood.
Course	structure
Tuesdays:	Lecture	(all	sections	meet	in	one	lecture	hall):	Kent	107
Thursdays:	Discussion sections	(each	section	meets	individually	in	its	own	classroom)
Course	requirements	and	grading
Papers
Students	will	write	three	papers,	and	they	will	turn	in	drafts	of	each	first,	on	which	they	will	receive	
comments	but	no	grade,	and	a	final	version,	which	is	graded.	Thus	each	paper	has	two	due	dates.	Each	
paper	is	worth	25%	of	your	final	grade	(75%	total	for	all	three	papers.)
Each	paper	should	be	between	1,000	and	1,500	words	(check	with	the	instructor	if	you	wish	to	go	outside	
those	limits).	Comments	on	the	papers	will	come	from	both	the	professor	and	the	writing	intern,	and	the	
precise	way	that	is	done	will	be	explained	by	your	professor.
The	themes	of	the	papers	must	be	selected	from	themes	given	by	the	lecturers.	These	themes	will	be	
posted	on	the	Chalk	website	(chalk.uchicago.edu)	after	the	discussion	sections	on	Thursdays	(generally	by	
the	end	of	the	day	Friday).	The	papers	must	deal	with	themes	covered	in	the	course	since	the	first	draft	of	
the	previous	paper	was	due	(except	for	the	first	paper,	of	course). Students	in	each	section	will	be	given	
specific	instructions	as	to	how	the	paper	should	be	handed	in	(hard	copy	and/or	electronic	version).
A	draft	of	the	first	paper	is	due	to	the	Writing	Intern	on	Monday	of	Week	4 and	the	revised	version	of	the	
paper	is	due	to	the	Instructor	on	Thursday	of	Week	5.	The	second	paper’s	draft	is	due	on	Monday	of	Week
7 and	the	revised	version	is	due	on	Thursday	of	Week	8. The	third	paper’s	draft	is	due	on	Monday	of	Week	
10	and	the	revised	version	is	due	on	the	Thursday	of	Exam	Week.	Each	paper	is	worth	25%	of	your	final	
grade	(75%	total	for	all	three	papers.)	The	mechanics	of	delivering	the	papers	will	be	announced	in	your	
section.	Drafts	are	mandatory;	see	also	Writing	Seminars	below.	
Writing	seminars.	There	will	be	three	writing	seminars	organized	by	the	Writing	Intern	during	the	quarter;	
these	writing	seminars	constitute	a	separate	course.	Attendance	at	these	is	also mandatory.	You	will	be	
assigned	a	separate	grade	(P/F)	for	this	course	by	the	instructor	in	consultation	with	the	Writing	
Intern. You	must	pass	this	part	of	the	course	separately	in	order	to	satisfy	the	College	Core	requirement;	
you	cannot	graduate	from	the	College	without	satisfying	this	requirement. You	cannot	take	these	writing	
seminars	separately	from	the	Core	course;	you must	pass	it	each	quarter,	or	you	will	have	to	retake	the	
entire	Core	course.
Preparation:	Readings	for	the	week	will	be	posted	by	the	end	of	Friday	before	the	Tuesday	lecture	in	
which	they	are	discussed;	you	should	read	them	before	the	lecture	(with	the	exception	of	the	first	week).	
By	Wednesday	at	noon	(or, as	your	instructor	decides),	each	student	should	post	to	the	discussion	board	
on	their	section’s	chalk	site a	brief	 response	to	the	readings that	consists	of	three	things:	(1)	an	idea	you	
found	compelling,	(2)	an	idea	you	did	not	find	compelling,	and	(3)	a	question	for	the	author	of	one	of	the	
readings.	The	entire	response	may	consist	of	just	a	few	sentences:	you	do	not	need	to	write	an	entire	
page	essay. The	comments	are	used	to	broaden	or	deepen	the	in-class	discussion.
Discussion	leaders: Each	student	will	be	expected	to	take	partial	responsibility	for	leading	one	of	the	
discussion	sections	each	week	during	the	quarter	(except	the	first	week).	Small	groups	of	two	to	three	
students	will	organize	and	lead	a	discussion	session	based	on	the	lecture	and	readings,	and	the	responses	
posted	by	the	other	students	in	the	section.
In	class	participation: Each	student	is	expected	to	be	well	prepared	to	participate	in	discussions	in	
section,	and,	where	appropriate,	in	lecture. Participation,	including	leading	of	the	discussion	and	
responses,	together	counts for	25%	of	the	course	grade.
Texts
All	texts	will	be	available	through	the	Canvas website	for	this	course.	Changes,	if	there	are	any,	will	be	
announced	in	class,	on	the	Canvas “all	sections”	site,	or	by	email.
In	class	screen	policy:
No	computers	or	cell	phones	or	tablets	or	the	like	may	be	used	during	lecture.	Please	mute	your	phones.
During	sections,	laptops	may	be	used	for	presentation.	Students	are	strongly	encouraged	restrict	the	use	
of	laptops	and	tablets	in	TH	class	to	the	minimum.	
Week	1.	October	2. Anastasia	Giannakidou.	What	is	language?	What	is	the	relation	of	meaning	
and	form?	 Is	there	a	language	authority?	
In	this	first	lecture,	we	discuss	fundamental	questions about	the	nature	of	language.	What	does	it	mean	
to	know	a	language?	What	is	a	linguistic	sign?	How	essential	is	the	relation	between	the	sign	and	the	
concept	it	signifies?	Is	there	a	correct	way	to	say	things?	What	are	language	norms?		Does	language	
change	over	time,	or	is	it	static? Are	there	language	authorities	and	what	is	their	function?

John	Goldsmith.	Vowels	in	motion.
English	vowels	have	been	changing	constantly	over	its	recorded	thousand	year	history,	and	we	have	a	
fairly	good	idea	of	what	these	changes	were,	based	on	a	variety	of	sources.	These	changes	are	the	result	
of	many	factors,	including	in	various	measure	the	isolation	of	speakers	of	different	dialects,	the	desire	to	
speak	in	a	way	that	reflects	one's	social	identity,	and	speakers'	needs	to	communicate.	We	will	look	at	one	
big	change	that	was	completed	around	the	time	of	Shakespeare,	called	the	Great	Vowel	Shift,	and	then	
another	one	that	is	only	now	emerging,	one	that	Chicago	and	the	cities	to	our	east,	through	the	state	of	
New	York,	are	participating	in,	the	Northern	Cities	Shift.	Like	other	social	norms,	these	changes	in	the	
sounds	of	English	occur	with	our	participation,	sometimes	conscious	but	often	only	partly	conscious:	we	
will	try	to	become	aware	of	these	linguistic	trends	that	are	happening	within	and	without	us.

Week	3.	October	16. Diane	Brentari.	Language	creation; language	change.
In	this	lecture	we	will	delineate	the	conditions	for language	evolution,	language	emergence, and language	
change.	These	are	three ways	that	linguistic	systems	come	into	being	or	undergo	modifications	over	time.
We	will	address	issues	of	naturalness	(iconicity)	and	conventionalism	(arbitrariness)	in	language	and	how	
they	are	shaped	by	a	range	of	factors	including	communities,	culture	and	the	linguistic	system	itself.	The	
focus	will	be	on	the	emergence	of	sign	languages	as	these	are	the	only	natural	languages	that	we	can	
directly	observe	as	they	are	created.

Week	4.	October	23. Matt	Teichman.	Language	and	thought.
Do	native	speakers	of	English	think	differently	from	native	speakers	of	Russian?		Are	there	thoughts	that	
it’s	possible	to	have	in	Russian	but	not	in	English?		Are	there	reasoning	patterns	that	make	sense	to	an	
English	speaker	but	would	be	impossible	for	a	Russian	speaker	to	understand?		The	idea	that	the	language	
you speak	natively	somehow	conditions	the	way	you	can	think	is	called	the	Whorfian	hypothesis	(named	
for	the	early	20th century	amateur	linguist,	Benjamin	Lee	Whorf),	and	it	has	historically	been	rather	
controversial	in	linguistics.		Why?		Although	it	may	intuitively	feel	like	you’re	thinking	differently	when	you	
speak	in	Russian	vs.	when	you	speak	in	English,	it	is	far	from	straightforward	to	find	hard	scientific	
evidence	that	supports	that	intuition.		And	yet,	despite	those	difficulties,	a	wave	of	research	in	
psycholinguistics	over	the	past	decade	or	so	has	uncovered	some	interesting	evidence	which,	although	
not	definitive,	raises	new	prospects	for	the	Whorfian	hypothesis.		We	will	consider	the	case	for	and	
against.

Week	5.	October	30. Michelle	Yuan. Invented	Languages
With	so	many	languages	in	 the	world	 to	choose	 from,	why	would	someone	invent	a	language?	How	do	
you	 even	 start?	 In	 this	 lecture,	 we	 will	 explore	 the	 creation	 of	 invented	 languages	 such	 as	 Esperanto,	
Klingon,	 Ithkuil,	 and	 other	 lesser-known	 languages. We	 will	 also	 consider	 some	 of	 the	 factors	 that	may	
influence	 the success	 or	 failure	 of	 an	 invented	 language	 and,	 in	 doing	 so,	 we’ll	 discuss	 how	 invented	
languages	 can	 give	 us	 insight	 into	 our	 own	 “natural”	 languages	 and	 what	 may	 fuel	 our	 desire	 to	
communicate	with	others	in	a	language	that	is	and	is	not	“our	own.”

Rebecca	Hasselbach-Andee.	Code	Switching	and	Diglossia:	Internal	
Language	Variation.
Every	language	has	internal	variations,	meaning there	are	different	ways	speakers	speak	their	language.	
The	use	of	different	“language	registers”	can	be	caused	by	geographical	variations	(dialects)	or	by	certain	
social	factors.	For	example,	you	most	likely	speak	in	a	different	way	with	your	family	and	friends	than	you	
do	in	class	or	in	a	job	interview.	In	writing,	you	might	use	yet	another	variant.	Changing	from	one	variety	
to	another	is	called	“code	switching”.	When	code	switching	is	institutionalized	and	pervades	the	majority	
of	a	society,	we	speak	of “diglossia”.	More	specifically,	diglossia	describes	a	cross-linguistically	widespread	
phenomenon	in	which	a	single	language	or	two	different	languages	develop	a	prestige	variant	used	for	
specific	literary	and	formal	functions.	Diglossia	can	develop	in	situations	characterized	by	strong	political	
or	other	ideological	factors, and	thus	reflects	one	possible	sociolinguistic	output	of	factors	such	as	
language	and	identity,	language	and	politics,	etc.	We	look	at	various	examples	of	diglossia/code	switching	
and	at	the	reasons	underlying	the	development	of	prestigious	versus	non-prestigious	language	registers.

Anqi	Zhang.	Language	policy	and	education.	
As	a	crucial	way	to	transmit	knowledge,	language	plays	an	important	role	in	education.	However,	it	is	not	
always	easy	to	determine	what	languages	should	be	used	or	taught	at	school,	especially	in	a	multilingual	
country.	What	factors	should	language	policy	makers	consider	when	making	decisions	on	what	languages	
should	be	used	and	taught	at	school	and	how	do	these	decisions	impact	people’s	lives?	In	this	lecture,	we	
will	explore	how	language policy,	language	planning	and	education	interact	with	people’s	lives.	We	will	
first	discuss	some	general	concepts	and	ideologies	of	language	in	education,	and	the	advantages	and	
disadvantages	of	various	forms	of	language	policies	and	planning,	and	then	we will	look	at	some	cases	of	
the	language	policies	and	planning	in	the	education	in	China,	focusing	on	the	Cantonese	province	and	
Hong	Kong.

Adam	Singerman.	 Language	endangerment,	language	shift,	and	language	
death.
Scholars	estimate	that	between	fifty	and	ninety	percent	of	the	world's	7000	languages	will	no	longer	be	
spoken	(or	signed)	by	the	end	of	the	21st	century.	This	startling	statistic	leads	to	a	wide range	of
challenging	questions.	What	are	the	factors	— socioeconomic,	cultural,	historical	— that	lead	to	language	
endangerment?	What	do	speakers	gain	or	lose	when	they	shift	from	one	language	to	another?	What	are	
the	consequences	of	endangerment,	shift,	and	death	for	the	scientific	study	of	language?	What	actions	
can	be	taken	to	document	or	revitalize endangered	languages?	This	lecture	will	discuss	the	
aforementioned	questions	and	will	also	consider	critiques	of	the	enterprise	of	endangered	language	
documentation. Does	it	make	sense	to	speak	of	""preserving""	or	""saving""	languages	that	are	losing	
speakers/signers,	or	are	these	terms	incoherent?	Is	""endangered	language""	the	right	metaphor	to	
describe	what	is	going	on?	The	discussion	will	draw	upon	the	instructor's	experiences	conducting	linguistic	
fieldwork	in	the	Brazilian	Amazon.

[Because	of	Thanksgiving,	we	will	have	section	discussion	of	week	9’s	lecture	and	readings	on Tuesday,	
Dec.	4,	locations	to announced;	In	week	9	we	will	have	discussion	of	the	topic	of	Week	8]
Amy	Dahlstrom.	Names	and	naming.
This	week’s	topic	touches	upon	many	of	the	other	issues	discussed	in	earlier	lectures,	such	as	identity,	the	
relation	between	language	and	thought,	variation	and	change	over	time.	Patterns	of	names	and	namegiving,	not	surprisingly, vary	greatly	across	cultures.	In	many	parts	of	Africa,	traditional	names	given	to	
children	may	actually	be	messages	directed	at	other	members	of	the	family	(see	the	Suzman	article).	
What	messages	are	name-givers	sending	in	our culture,	and	to	whom?	What	factors	influence	parents’	
choice	of	a	first	name	for	a	child?	(assimilation?	uniqueness?	ethnic	pride?	religious	beliefs?	obsession	
with	Game	of	Thrones?	...)	The	article	by	Anderson	Smith	attempts	to	explain	to	a	social	worker	audience	
why	some	African-Americans	value	unique	first	names.	
Some	 other	 countries	 strictly	 regulate	 the	 pool	 of	 possible	 personal	 names,	 while	 U.S.	 states	
generally	do	not.	The	optional	 reading	surveys	U.S.	naming	laws,	considering	whether	some	 restrictions	
are	 needed	 and	 legally	 feasible. We’ll	 also	 look	 at	 family	 names,	 particularly	 the	 question	 of	 whether	
women	who	marry	take	their	husband’s	last	name,	retain	their	‘maiden’	name,	or	combine	or	hyphenate	
the	two.	Read	the	essay	by	Kass	and	Kass	for	a	conservative	view	on	names.

Modality

This continues to evolve, but I currently expect both sections of this course to be in person without a Zoom option.

 

Overview

 

The point of this course is to introduce students to the legal system and legal reasoning with an emphasis on the way that law shapes the strategic environment for businesses. Said differently, this course is about the intersection of law and business strategy.

 

There is no textbook for the course. I will post the readings in chunks throughout the quarter and you will be able to download the readings here. I set forth below a draft of what we are likely to cover this quarter, though the readings change year by year and I do like to update them as current events dictate.

 

Grading in the class is based 50% in the work in connection with the class blog and 50% based on a take home final. All work in the course must adhere to the Booth standards of conduct in the Honor Code and Standards of Scholarship.

 

As to the blog, as I will explain in greater detail via email, you will be required to do two individual blog posts, two group posts and four individual comments. One of the group posts will be presented in class.

Purpose and description

The philosophy of social science is a discipline that attempts to analyze the logic, methodology, modes of explanation, and methods of inquiry of the social sciences. It is based on the assumption that both philosophers and social scientists will benefit from a better understanding of the conceptual and methodological issues that arise in the conduct of social science research. One of the goals of the discipline is to allow us to come to some judgments about the degree of validity and credibility that typical social science theories have as assertions about the nature of the social world we experience.

My approach to the philosophy of social science is based on the idea that the discipline should develop its theories and analyses by working closely with strong examples of good social science research. Philosophy is sometimes seen as the apriori exploration of a set of ideas or concepts. My approach asks that we abandon this aprioricity and construct our discipline by learning from specific fields of social science research, observing the achievements and obstacles that can be identified in the history of social science, and then by reflecting philosophically on these issues and concepts. We should frame the defining questions of the philosophy of social science by reflecting upon the large conceptual and methodological issues that have actually been important to social scientists as they conduct their research and theory construction.

Before we can create genuinely insightful social sciences, we need to fully confront the important differences between social and natural phenomena. Individual agents are different from atoms or molecules, social structures are different from physical structures such as metals or crystals, and the inexact regularities of social life are different from laws of nature. So social science explanations and social science theories will unavoidably display corresponding differences from these constructs in the natural sciences.

This lecture series is intended to introduce students to some of the topics that the author has focused on in his studies of the social sciences. Not all philosophers approach the subject matter in exactly this way. So these lectures are not intended to provide a broad survey of the philosophy of social science by all western philosophers. Instead, these lectures are designed to stimulate new questions for Chinese social scientists about the logic and nature of the fields of social science research.

Other important contributions to the field of western philosophy of social science include writings by Jon Elster, David Braybrooke, Alexander Rosenberg, Paul Roth, and Richard Miller. Important contributions to analytical Marxism include writings by Gerald Cohen, Jon Elster, Richard Miller, Adam Przeworski, and John Roemer. Bibliographies that include citations to these works will be provided as course materials.

Writing Assignments

There will be no examinations in the course.  Each week there will be a short paper on an assigned topic related to the weeks readings.  You will be given a choice of topics each week.  Papers will be written in English with careful attention to clarity, focus, argument, and content.  Papers should be between 750 and 1500 words.  Papers are due by 4:00 pm on the Friday of the week in which these readings are discussed.  I am interested in reading how you approach the topic and reason through to your own position on the issue.  I will also expect a short essay that is a brief intellectual biography that will let me get acquainted with you (described below).  This should be completed before the first lecture.

 

More advanced students may wish to consult with me in order to formulate a paper topic that goes more deeply into an issue that you find interesting in the readings.

 

Prior to beginning of course
 
I would like to get to know you.  Please write a brief statement that describes your educational career and your main academic interests.  If you have thought about social science methodology in the past, I would be interested in hearing some of your thoughts (about political science, anthropology, sociology, or history, for example).  I would also be interested in hearing your thoughts about the role of humanities in your studies (philosophy, literature, the arts).  And I would be interested to know what your career plans are at this point.

 

Week 1. Philosophy of social science

 

Do you think that the social sciences should discover generalizations about social phenomena, analogous to laws of nature? Are there examples of social generalizations that you find convincing?  Your paper should take some account of the arguments against social generalizations in the readings, but of course you are free to come to a different conclusion.

 

OR:

 

Do the assumptions of individual rationality provide a convincing and comprehensive basis for discovering explanations of social outcomes and patterns?  What are the strengths and weaknesses of rational choice theory as a basis for social explanation?

 

Week 2. Analytical Marxism

 

Do Marx's writings provide the basis for a scientific theory of society?  What are the main elements of such a theory?  What are some of the limitations of Marx's theory of capitalist development and capitalist society?  How do the arguments considered in the previous readings about the necessary incompleteness of social theory pertain to Marxism?

 

OR:

 

Does the concept of social class have relevance to every society?  How can we best define social class?  Is the concept relevant in a family farming economy?  Is it relevant in a hunter-gatherer society?  Or is it most relevant to the formative period of capitalism in Great Britain in the nineteenth century?  In what ways do we need to provide other analytical tools for understanding group behavior beyond the category of class? 

 

Week 3. Western theories of Chinese history

 

Discuss the occurrence of social mobilization and collective action in Chinese history.  What factors were most important in the mobilization of peasants or urban dwellers in different periods of Chinese social unrest?  What are the most convincing theories of peasant rebellion?

 

OR:

 

Discuss the factors that are most important in setting the course of China's economic development in the late imperial times. Factors that you might consider could include: population dynamics, features of the state, relationships to powerful external states, the nature of the property system, or the discovery and diffusion of technology. Is China's economic development from 1800 to 2000 a process that can be explained in terms of a few simple factors? Or it is a more contingent and variable process?

 

Outline of topics and readings

Lectures will be presented in the context of a powerpoint presentation on the day's topic. The presentation will be made available to the class before it is presented. Readings are divided into ""Core"" readings that everyone should do, and ""Extended"" readings that advanced students will wish to complete.

Class sessions will be organized in two-hour blocks. The first hour will be devoted to a lecture presentation of the topic, and the second hour will be an organized discussion of these ideas. In order to gain the best benefit possible in the discussion period, I will ask groups of students to work together to formulate some questions. Then each group will have a few minutes to present its questions for discussion by the professor and other members of the class.

Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. Psychology is a very diverse
field – researchers study everything from the function of the brain to the behavior of entire cultural
groups. We will focus on identifying and understanding some of the fundamental psychological
concepts that have been derived from scientific methodology in a variety of areas. We will link basic
and applied research together through lectures, discussions, class activities, and media presentations
to demonstrate how psychological knowledge can be used to improve the quality of our lives.
There are three basic objectives in this course. The first objective is to develop knowledge about the
underlying philosophical questions in psychology, the basic terms and concepts, the research
findings and theories of some of the main areas of psychology. The second objective is to develop
critical thinking skills that will help you become a more critical and informed consumer of scientific
information. The third objective is to apply your psychological knowledge to improve your life and
the lives of those around you.

Grading: The five exams allow a maximum total score of 300 points (five exams: 60 multiple choice
questions - worth one point each). The number of points that you earn out of the 300 possible
points will be used to determine your grade. You should address any problems with your scores
ASAP, not at the end of the semester.
Exams: There will be five exams. Each exam is worth 60 points and will consist of multiple choice
questions. Though the maximum number of points you can get on any individual exam is 60, each
respective exam will include a small number of additional questions which can count as bonus
points. The final exam will not be cumulative. Make up exams will not be given without proper
documentation (e.g., note from a doctor; police report).
Research Credits: It is a course requirement for PSYCH 171 to participate in psychological
research at this University. This is designed to provide you with the experience of serving as a
subject in a real psychological experiment. Each student must complete 4 units of research. A unit
consists of either participating in a research project (you cannot participate in the same experiment
more than once) or reading and summarizing a journal article. This is a required component of this
class. Failure to complete this component of the course will result in an “Incomplete” grade.
 Participating in Psychology Experiments:
1. You will receive your login information and a password by e-mail during the 1st
week of the semester. If you have not received this information by Thursday,
September 13, please contact the administrator, Janice Jones for assistance at
jljone@umd.umich.edu. If you register late, you will need to contact the
administrator to have an account established for you.
2. Once you have your login information, go to http://umd-umich.sona-systems.com/
to login. There you will find out about each different psychology study, including
what it's about, its time commitment, the eligibility requirements and restrictions,
whether it's online or in-person, when and where it is, how many credits it's worth,
and whom to contact. Be aware that you can participate in no more than two online
studies. In addition, DON'T BE LATE to the studies! Even being one minute late
can ruin a study.
 Alternative Participation (Article Summary): If you choose to do an article summary (the
alternative participation requirement), you must access the Web site devoted to this option
and choose among the seven possible articles. Go to:
http://www.casl.umd.umich.edu/index.php?id=687244 and click the Alternative
Participation Policies link. When you get to the Web site, choose an interesting topic to
download the instruction handout and it will tell you the title of the article, how to access it
in the library, what questions you must answer in your summary, how to format your
summary, the deadline for this assignment, and the contact information for Ms. Jan L. Jones.
Each article summary is worth one unit of research credit. Remember that plagiarism will
result in an E for the entire course.

A Message to Students
Helpful Hints on How to Get the Most Out of This Course
ATTEND CLASS. Bright, highly motivated students who have superior study skills can
learn alone most of what the book presents to you -- enough to do quite well on exam questions
that cover the textbook material. However, a considerable amount of material that is not in the
textbook will be presented during classes and a number of exam questions will come from material
presented exclusively in lectures. Research has shown that one
of the best predictors of grades in courses is class attendance, and even the brightest students gain
more insight by attending classes regularly.
STUDY CHAPTERS EARLY. Some lectures overlap with information in the book, but
even for lecture material that is not redundant with the book, you will learn best by reading/studying
the assigned chapters by the date on which they are indicated on the syllabus. Students who read the
chapters prior to class will find it rewarding when the quiz questions occur. We will assume in
lectures that you have covered the assigned chapters, and hence will not focus unnecessarily on
terms/concepts that are well defined in the book. There will be exceptions to this because in some
lectures we choose to emphasize particular concepts that are covered in the book or we believe that
the book does not cover that material particularly well. However, lack of emphasis or coverage
during lectures does not mean lack of importance of material in the book. You should strive to
complete assigned chapters on time and several days before an exam. Studying early leaves much
more time for resolving difficulties and reviewing the material -- repetition is a fundamental principle
of learning.
READ, STUDY, AND TAKE NOTES ""ACTIVELY."" Research shows that many
individuals read and write passively, that is, without thinking about the meaning of what they are
covering. In reading and studying textbook type material, everyone (professors included) must read
actively and as a result somewhat slowly. You must try to understand what you are trying to learn
within the framework of what you have already learned. Research shows that learning is much more
effective if new information is related to old information. Not only must you work on textbook
material actively, but you must also stay mentally active during class. Passively writing down what is
on the overhead screen or what we say in class without thinking about it -- about how it fits with
previous material in earlier classes or earlier in that lecture -- will not help you learn or understand
the material. Rewrite your notes as soon after class as possible.
BEFORE BEGINNING A CHAPTER, ACTIVELY STUDY THE SUMMARY
FIRST. Also, you should page through the chapter reading headings and illustrations actively to
gain a good general understanding of major themes and ideas. These major ideas serve as part of the
framework for you to organize the more detailed information if you are to gain a good overall
understanding.
OUTLINE EACH CHAPTER. By outline, we mean that you should take organized notes
on the chapter as you go through it the first time, just as though you were taking notes on a lecture.
Research shows that taking good notes requires active thinking and is much superior to helping you
learn any material to underlining or highlighting text material. If you take good notes on chapters,
you should be able to study primarily from these notes without
having to reread text material. In the long run, that will save you time, particularly as you become
more and more skilled (through practice) at taking quality notes on text material. These notes and

your lecture notes should be reviewed as many times as feasible in preparation for each exam. Your
textbook notes will also give you a manageable amount of material that you can review in
preparation for the comprehensive exam that covers the entire course in the event that you need to
take it
ALTER YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR STUDYING. Research consistently shows that
college students greatly underestimate the effort and time it takes to do a quality job of learning the
new and complex material that is a part of most of your courses. Academic experts generally agree
that, for a typical three-semester hour course, spending about 9 hours per week outside of class
working on learning is the norm for reasonable achievement. However, if the course is particularly
difficult or if your skills are not as great as the typical students', you will likely need to spend even
more than 9 hours per week to do well in the course.
KEEP THE BIG PICTURE IN MIND. Not only must you learn quite an amount of
information that you might consider rather detailed, but you should also strive to understand the
broader themes and context at all times. Keep in mind what you have learned in previous chapters
and lectures. Themes work best when understood together rather than in isolation. In fact,
individuals who, after a course is completed, have gone back and reread the textbook, report
considerably greater understanding of material partly because the context has changed (e.g., they
perceive chap. 2 differently after having studied chapters 3 and 4).
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK THEM. Class time is not the appropriate time for
individual specific questions about text material that you are unclear about, although good questions
that extend or broaden what you have learned in the book or heard in lectures are strongly
encouraged during classes. Such questions enrich class in general and are strongly encouraged. For
more detailed questions, seek us out after class, during office hours, or make an appointment.
IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS, SEEK SOLUTIONS EARLY. For example, if you do
poorly on an exam, see one of us at that time (instead of later in the course). In addition, the Student
Counseling Service (313) 593-5430 exists to help students, whether the source of a problem is
personal or academic. If we can help you or point you in the right direction, we certainly will, but
you must ask for help first.",,,,

“Progress	in	human	affairs,	whether	in	science	or	in	history	or	in	society,	has	come	mainly	
through	the	bold	readiness	of	human	beings	not	to	confine	themselves	to	seeking	piecemeal	
improvements	in	the	way	things	are	done,	but	to	present	fundamental	challenges	in	the	name	
of	reason	to	the	current	way	of	doing	things	and	to	the	avowed	or	hidden	assumptions	on	which	
it	rests.	I	look	forward	to	a	time	when	the	historians	and	sociologists	and	political	thinkers	of

Preliminary	Note:
The	course	was	designed	as	a	required	course	for	the	joint	doctoral	students	in	social	work	and	social	
sciences.		As	such	it	has	three	major	objectives:	1)	to	provide	a	sound	grounding	in	the	history	of	the	
profession	of	social	work;	2)	to	provide	an	equally	sound	grounding	in	the	history	and	philosophy	of	
social	welfare	policy and	services	in	the	U.S.;	and	3)	to	introduce	and	apply	comparative	frameworks	
for	examining	domestic,	cross-national	and/or	global	social	work,	social	welfare	policy,	and/or	
program	or	service	interventions.	
Course	Abstract
This	course	centers	on	the	examination	of	the	purposes	of	social	welfare	and	social	work	and	how	
they	have	reflected	different	philosophical	and	ideological	positions,	diverse	class,	racial,	ethnic,	and	
cultural	perspectives,	and	the	particular	historical	contexts	in	which	they	emerged.		It	covers	long	
standing	conflicts	and	tensions	in	the	field	such	as	the	role	of	social	responsibility	vs.	social	control,	
how	needs	are	recognized	and	determined,	the	nature	of	helping,	perspectives	on	social	justice	and	
charity,	the	professional	role	of	social	workers,	and	organizational	arrangements	for	social	work	and	
social	welfare.	The	focus	of	this	course	is	on	the	development	of	U.S.	social	welfare	and	social	work	
with	a	comparative,	cross-national	and	multicultural	lens.	
Course	Objectives
• Demonstrate	an	ability	to	explain	and	critique	the	emergence	and	transformation	of	the	U.S.	
welfare	state;
• Distinguish	between	different	theoretical,	philosophical,	and	practice	assumptions	
throughout	the	history	of	U.S.	social	welfare.	Critically	apply	these	assumptions	in	
comparative	work;
• Demonstrate	an	ability	to	explain	and	critique	the	development	of	social	services	in	the	U.S.	
from	a	multicultural	perspective	assessing	the	influence	of	racial,	gender,	class,	religious	and	
cultural	factors;
• Develop	an understanding	of	the	evolution	of	the	social	work	profession	in	the	U.S.	and	its	
relationship	to	the	“scientific”	and/or	“research”	enterprise	(including	the	role	of	
movements:	scientific	charity,	empirical	practice,	the	evidence-based	practice	movement	
and	the	historical	roles	of	methods:	such	as	case	study,	social	surveys,	intervention,	singlesubject	design,	etc);	
• Develop	a	sense	of	your	own	place	in	the	history	and	future	development	of	social	welfare,	
social	work	and	knowledge	production	and/or	scholarship;
• Demonstrate	an	ability	to	differentiate	between	the	public,	nonprofit,	and	for	profit	sectors	
and	critique	the	relative	benefits	and	limitations	of	their	contributions	to	social	welfare	and	
social	justice	agendas;	
• Demonstrate	an	ability	to	utilize historical	research	methods	to	analyze	the	emergence	of	
professional	social	work,	the	generation	of	social	work	knowledge,	and/or	social	welfare	
policies	or	programs;
• Demonstrate	an	understanding	of	how	historical	conflicts	and	tensions	have	shaped	the	
development	and	contemporary	landscape	of	social	welfare	policy	and	the	profession	of	
social	work;
• Demonstrate	an	ability	to	identify	and	analyze	various	conceptual	frameworks	(including	
differing	ideological	positions,	cultural	norms	and	values,	political	tensions,	economic	
systems,	and	social	goals)	and	assess	their	impact	on	the	evolving	definitions	of	social	
problems	and	the	range	of	alternatives	(programs,	services,	and	policies)	proposed	to	
address	them.	In	particular	be	able	to	critically	assess	these	frameworks	in	cross-national	
contexts;
• Demonstrate	an	ability	to	recognize	and	explain	the	recurring	nature	of	themes,	conflicts,	
and	debates	in	U.S.	social	welfare	and	interpret	the	ways	in	which	they	were	shaped	by	their	
historical	context.		Be	prepared	to	evaluate	these	basic	ideas	in	a	global	context;
• Demonstrate	an	ability	to	identify	a	variety	of	policies	and	strategies	in	global	interventions	
(such	as	the	world	bank,	micro	enterprises,	the	role	of	non	governmental	agencies,	disaster	
relief,	private	philanthropy,	and	world	aid	projects).

Course	Organization/Assignments:
Course	Organization:		This	course	will	be	conducted	as	a	seminar	that	combines	lectures	by	the	
instructor,	student-led	class	discussions on	4	major	readings, and	student	presentations on	
individual	original	research	projects.		To	be	successful,	a	seminar	requires	the	full	participation	of	all	
members in	all	aspects	of	this	course.		This	includes	active	and	critical	engagement	with	the	assigned	
readings,	preparation	for	class,	and	thoughtful	and	respectful	participation	in	class.	
Assignments	and	Grading:	There	are	three assignments	for	this	course.		Detailed	instructions	for	
the	second assignment will	be	distributed	under separate	cover.		In	brief,	these	assignments are:	
1) “Obituary” Assignment. This	will	reflect	10%	of	your	final	grade.		Write	your	own	
professional	obituary. (If	that	seems	to	ghoulish	to	you,	you	can	write	your	own	honorary	
retirement	speech!).				In	essence,	it	should	speak	to	what	you	hope	to	accomplish	in	your	
professional	life	as	social	worker,	researcher,	scholar,	teacher	etc. As	you	situate	your	own	
envisioned	career,	demonstrate	that	you	can	place	your	life’s	work	in	the	broader	historical	
professional	discourses that	we	will	be	discussing	in	class. What	intellectual	and/or	practice	
“footprint”	or	legacy	do	you	wish	to	leave	on	the	social	work	profession	and	how	might	it	
connect	to	what’s	already	been	done? (5	pages,	due	September	29).
2) Book	Club	Discussion	and	Essay.		This	will	reflect	40%	of	your	final	grade.	We	will	be	
reading	four	books	on some	aspect	of	social	work	history written	by	contemporary,	
preeminent	scholars in	the	field.		Although	all	students	are	responsible	for	reading	all	of	these	
books,	each	student	will	select	one book	for	the	purposes	of	this	assignment.		(There	will	be	
several	students	per	book).		Each	student	is	responsible	for:	a)	writing	a	critical book	review	
essay	(7-8	pages);	b)	drafting	at	least	3	class	discussion	questions;	and	c)	leading	(a	lively!)	
class	discussion	on	the	books	(in	conjunction	with	your	classmates assigned	to	the	same	
book).		The	critical	book	review	essay	should:	provide	a	concise	summary	of	the	content of	
the	book,	offer	a	critical	assessment	(what	was	significant, what	was	effective,	how	did	it	
enhance	or	inform	your	views about	social	work),	links	or	references	to	other	reading	or	
literature	and	identify	its contribution	to	your	development	as	a	social	work	scholar.		
3) Original	Historical	Research	Paper	and	Presentation	(See	separate	handout).	The	
assignment	will	require	researching	and	writing	an	original	historical	paper	and	presenting	
your	findings.	It	is	critical	to	start	on	the	historical	research	paper	early	in	the semester	as	
identifying	a	topic	and	original	sources	often	takes	time. This	will	reflect	50%	of	your	final	
grade.

Tensions	among	micro,	mezzo	and	macro	practices.	Science,	social	science,	practice	wisdom,	
scholarship,	research,	knowledge.			What	informs	social	work	practice?	What	is	social	work	research?	
Who	conducts	it?	Who	utilizes	it?		How	is	it conveyed	and	to	whom?	What	it	the	relationship	of	social	
work	knowledge	to	that	of	the	disciplines?		How	does	a	joint	doctoral	student	at	the	University	of	
Michigan	make	sense	of	this?	
The	Creation of	the	Welfare	State:	The	Great	Depression:	banks,	bankruptcy,	foreclosures,	hunger	and	
human	needs.	The	New	Deal:	responses	and	a	multi-prong	attack.		The	Three	Rs:	Relief,	Recovery	and	
Reform.	The	Social	Security	Act:	Structure,	implications,	legacy	and	future.		Who	was	included?	Who	
was	excluded?		Compare	to	the:	Great	Recession	of	2008 Banks,	bankruptcy,	foreclosures,	hunger	and	
human	needs	and	Obama’s	Stimulus	Package	and	recovery.

Land Acknowledgement
We acknowledge that the University of Michigan, named for Michigami, the world’s largest
freshwater system and located in the Huron River watershed, was formed and has grown
through connections with the land stewarded by Niswi Ishkodewan Anishinaabeg: The Three
Fires People who are Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi along with their neighbours the
Seneca, Delaware, Shawnee and Wyandot nations.
Legacies
As we live and learn on these territories, we must keep in mind the community struggles for
self-determination and colonial legacies of scholarly practices. I use community struggles
broadly to include indigenous peoples, enslaved peoples, and those peoples of the MexicoRepublic of Texas territories. I use colonial legacies to reflect our existing social structures,
institutions, systems, and policies built from colonial domination.

1. Course Description:
This course will provide content on the logic of inquiry and the necessity for an empirical
approach to practice. The process of formulating appropriate research questions and
hypotheses, techniques for testing relationships and patterns among variables, methods of data
collection, methods to assess and improve the validity and reliability of data and measures,
and the ethics of scientific inquiry will be addressed. This course will help students
understand practice through the critical examination of methods associated with decisionmaking, critical thinking, and ethical judgment. The course content will integrate the core
themes related to multiculturalism and diversity; social justice and social change; promotion,
prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation; and behavioral and social science research.
2. Course Content:
This course will cover qualitative and quantitative research methods, commonly used
statistical procedures, and approaches to the evaluation of practice. Students will learn how to
understand and appreciate a scientific approach to building practice knowledge and for
evaluating practice. Special emphasis will be placed on increasing one’s ability to critique
theoretical foundations of research, form research questions, apply research methods, conduct
statistical analysis, and interpret research reports. The latest statistical, graphical, and display
technologies will be used.
3. Course Competencies and Practice Behaviors:
This course addresses the following competencies and practice behaviors:
COMPETENCY 2—Apply social work ethical principles to guide professional practice.
Social workers have an obligation to conduct themselves ethically and to engage in ethical
decision-making. Social workers are knowledgeable about the value base of the profession, its
ethical standards, and relevant law. Social workers:
2.1 recognize and manage personal values in a way that allows professional values to guide
practice;
2.4 apply strategies of ethical reasoning to arrive at principled decisions.
COMPETENCY 3—Apply critical thinking to inform and communicate professional
judgments.
Social workers are knowledgeable about the principles of logic, scientific inquiry, and
reasoned discernment. They use critical thinking augmented by creativity and curiosity.
Critical thinking also requires the synthesis and communication of relevant information.
Social workers:
3.1 distinguish, appraise, and integrate multiple sources of knowledge, including researchbased knowledge, and practice wisdom;
3.2 analyze models of assessment, prevention, intervention, and evaluation; and
3
COMPETENCY 4—Engage diversity and difference in practice.
Social workers understand how diversity characterizes and shapes the human experience and
is critical to the formation of identity. The dimensions of diversity are understood as the
intersectionality of multiple factors including age, class, color, culture, disability, ethnicity,
gender, gender identity and expression, immigration status, political ideology, race, religion,
sex, and sexual orientation. Social workers appreciate that, as a consequence of difference, a
person’s life experiences may include oppression, poverty, marginalization, and alienation as
well as privilege, power, and acclaim. Social workers:
4.1 recognize the extent to which a culture’s structures and values may oppress, marginalize,
alienate, or create or enhance privilege and power;
4.3 recognize and communicate their understanding of the importance of difference in shaping
life experiences;
COMPETENCY 6—Engage in research-informed practice and practice-informed research.
Social workers use practice experience to inform research, employ evidence-based
interventions, evaluate their own practice, and use research findings to improve practice,
policy, and social service delivery. Social workers comprehend quantitative and qualitative
research and understand scientific and ethical approaches to building knowledge. Social
workers:
6.1 use practice experience to inform scientific inquiry and
6.2 use research evidence to inform practice.
COMPETENCY 7—Apply knowledge of human behavior and the social environment.
Social workers are knowledgeable about human behavior across the life course; the range of
social systems in which people live; and the ways social systems promote or deter people in
maintaining or achieving health and well-being. Social workers apply theories and knowledge
from the liberal arts to understand biological, social, cultural, psychological, and spiritual
development. Social workers:
7.2 critique and apply knowledge to understand person and environment.
COMPETENCY 10—Engage, assess, intervene, and evaluate with individuals, families,
groups, organizations, and communities.
Professional practice involves the dynamic and interactive processes of engagement,
assessment, intervention, and evaluation at multiple levels. Social workers have the
knowledge and skills to practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and
communities. Practice knowledge includes identifying, analyzing, and implementing
evidence-based interventions designed to achieve client goals; using research and
technological advances; evaluating program outcomes and practice effectiveness; developing, 
4
analyzing, advocating, and providing leadership for policies and services; and promoting
social and economic justice.
COMPETENCY 10(b)—Assessment
Social workers:
10.b.4 select appropriate intervention strategies.
COMPETENCY 10(d)—Evaluation
Social workers:
10.d.1 critically analyze, monitor, and evaluate interventions.
4. Course Objectives:
Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:
1. Act as a critical consumer and contributor of the design, methodology, and conclusions of
social work and social and behavioral science research publications.
a. understand research concepts to permit a critical analysis of research and evaluation
studies with respect to quality, bias, ethics, and potential applications.
b. assess the strengths and weaknesses of selected research designs and methodology,
and of selected measures and measurement strategies.
c. assess the cultural sensitivity of measures and measurement strategies.
d. assess the biases and implications of conclusions drawn in the research studies.
(Practice Behaviors 3.1, 3.2, 6.1)
2. Locate, assess and critique research studies so as to draw appropriate inference,
particularly as it affects diverse populations at risk (dimension: ability, age, class, color,
culture, ethnicity, family structure, gender [including gender identity and gender expression],
marital status, national origin, race, religion or spirituality, sex, and sexual orientation).
a. frame research questions and develop problem statements that reflect the issues under
consideration.
b. apply research concepts and principles in the development and use of selected
qualitative and quantitative methodologies and analytical approaches.
c. choose appropriate research designs and methodology given a particular research
question.
d. demonstrate the ability to select culturally appropriate measures and measurement
strategies given specific populations.
e. construct simple indices, questionnaires, and measures relevant to the evaluation of
practice.
f. conduct selected analytic and statistical procedures
g. demonstrate the ability to interpret and draw conclusions from selected analytic and
statistical procedures. (Practice Behaviors 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.3, 6.1, 6.2, 7.2, 11.4, 13.1)
5
3. Know the NASW Code of Ethics and appropriately apply it in the conduct of social work
research.
a. understand ethical issues in the conduct of research and evaluation.
b. understand the relevance and applicability of research in working with disadvantaged,
disenfranchised, and diverse populations at risk: (dimension: ability, age, class, color,
culture, ethnicity, family structure, gender [including gender identity and gender
expression)] marital status, national origin, race, religion or spirituality, sex, and
sexual orientation).
c. examine the processes by which research and evaluation findings can be used to
enhance social justice, social change, promotion, prevention, treatment, and
rehabilitation. (Practice Behaviors 2.1, 2.4, 7.2, 13.1)
5. Course Design:
Due to COVID-19, this course will be taught completely online. We will use some
elements of a flipped classroom model—students learn about the basics of the topic through
the assigned materials before the corresponding live-session, and engage in higher cognitive
levels of learning with peers and instructor present during the live-sessions. Working on
problems with a small group of peers will be a major live-session activity. Other methods will
also be used for acquiring knowledge and skills including: brief lectures, class discussion, and group
projects. This course is designed to increase students' comfort level with research methods and
statistical analyses and to increase their appreciation of the relevance of research and evaluation for
social work practice.
6. Relationship of the Course to Four Curricular Themes:
• Multiculturalism and Diversity. This course will include material on methods to
improve the cultural inclusiveness and cultural sensitivity of research methods.
This content will cover culturally sensitive measures, inclusion of diverse groups
of adequate size in sampling, culturally aware interpretations of data, and
culturally responsible dissemination of results. The basic purpose of research and
practice evaluation will also be analyzed from culturally bound perspectives.
• Social Justice and Social Change. Students will gain an understanding of the ways
in which research and evaluation have sometimes been used against oppressed
groups, for example through unethical practices, distortion of results, or fabrication
of data. Examples will be given of ways in which research can be used to
empower socially disadvantaged individuals, groups, and communities. These
examples will include studies in which the research participants were involved in
the study during all of its stages.
• Promotion, Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation. Studies reviewed in the
course will include examination of projects aimed at enhancing well-being and
preventing problems. The methodological and ethical problems unique to studies
of promotion and prevention efforts will be described. The social work values
consistent with promotion/prevention research will be analyzed.
6
• Behavioral and Social Science Research. The unique challenges in applying social
science knowledge and methods to social work settings will be covered. These
challenges include the practical and ethical dilemmas of applied research.
Emphasis will be placed on the way established theories and methods influence the
selection of research questions and methods. Studies will be critiqued for their
ability to advance social science theory and knowledge and to improve social work
practice.
7. Relationship of the Course to Social Work Ethics and Values:
The research and evaluation section of the NASW Code of Ethics will be applied
throughout this course. Examples of common ethical dilemmas will be presented. Among the
areas of ethics to be covered will be informed consent procedures, protection of research
participants from harm, confidentiality, and accurate reporting of results. Emphasis will also
be placed on the social workers’ ethical obligation to use scientifically sound practice and to
continually evaluate practice and programs.

Course Description
In this course, we explore a variety of common quantitative modeling problems that arise
frequently in business settings and discuss how they can be formally modeled and solved
with a combination of business insight and computer-based tools. The key topics we cover
include capacity management, service operations, inventory control, structured decision
making, constrained optimization, and simulation. Through this course, you will learn to
model complex business situations, and you will master tools to improve business
performance. The goal is to provide you a set of foundational skills useful for future
coursework at Wharton, as well as provide an overview of problems and techniques that
characterize disciplines covered in the Operations, Information and Decisions Department.
The course assumes no specific background beyond basic mathematics skills. Familiarity
with the basic operations of Excel is helpful, but not required—we will provide tutorials for
the needed Excel skills. Furthermore, no prior experience with programming or statistics is
expected.
Incidentally, in case you are wondering, the preferred pronunciation for the OID
Department’s name is to say each letter rather than to try to say something that might rhyme
with “android” or “avoid”. Think the communications giant AT&T, as in “A,” “T,” “and,”
“T”.
Course Format
Course sessions iterate between a lecture and a recitation format. The lecture is designed to
introduce concepts. The recitation reinforces the concepts through recitation exercises that
provide hands-on practice and are graded. During the recitation type sessions, we will work
through calculations introduced in the lecture, and then you complete a “recitation exercise”
that is graded. To promote learning, you are free to ask questions regarding the exercise
while working on it.
Electronics:
To encourage learning, electronic devices (e.g., mobile devices, tablets, laptops) during
lectures are not allowed unless explicitly directed by the instructor. Electronic devices may be
used during the time in which you are working on recitation exercises.
Mentoring:
There are weekly mentoring sessions. During the mentoring session, the mentor (an
experienced undergraduate student) will work through several practice problems related to
the week’s lecture materials. Mentoring sessions are intended to supplement rather than
replace attending course sessions. Mentoring is optional. The mentoring problems/slides
will be posted on Canvas after all mentoring sessions are completed so that they are available
to all students in the course. Visit the course Canvas to see the mentoring schedule and to
sign up for a session.
Page 4 of 10
TA support:
The course has several Teaching Assistants to help you with any aspect of the course. See the
course Canvas for the schedule of their availability.
Course Materials
Textbook:
We have a custom textbook for this course that is available as a printed book for $60 or as an
e-book for $49. The book covers the material in the class. As the lectures/slides also cover the
course material, the book is not strictly required. However, it is a useful resource to provide
additional support, reference reading, and practice problems.
The print version is available at the Penn Bookstore entitled: OIDD 101: Introduction to
Operations, Information & Decisions Department, ISBN # 9781307738537.
The e-book version is available at: https://www.mheducation.com/highered/custom.html.
Enter the ISBN #: “9781307740400 “ or “OIDD 101” in the “Search Here for new
materials” area. You can pay via credit card and you will need to create an account. If you
encounter any issues purchasing the eBook, technical assistance is available at McGrawHill support line: 1-800-331-5094, press 2, press 2 ( Create), press 1..
Online:
Canvas is a web-based application that houses online materials for enrolled students across
Wharton. You can access our course by logging into our Canvas page listed at the front of
this syllabus.
The course Canvas site will be the definitive source for all assignments and deadlines. You
will not have access to Canvas until you officially register for the course.
Slides:
All slides will be posted on Canvas before they are used in class.
Software:
In this course we use Excel, and in particular two Excel add-ins: Solver and Crystal Ball. All
software required for the course is available through the Wharton computing labs in
Huntsman Hall.
If you are a non-Wharton student and want to use the software in the computing labs then
you will need to create (if you haven’t already done so) a “Wharton Class Account” that links
to your PennKey account. It takes about 15 minutes for a Wharton Class account to sync with
a user’s PennKey account. Go to this link for details:

Academic Integrity
Students are expected to adhere to the principles of the University’s Code of Academic
Integrity.
The following actions are a subsample of some of the ethical violations specific to this course:
• Informing students of the content of a recitation exercise before the student has
attended their recitation.
• Completing any portion of a recitation exercise that is not your own.
• Broadcasting or disseminating or discussing in any manner or form solutions to
graded content without actual collaboration. Put more simply, if you are sharing
solutions with other students who may merely be copying your solutions, then that is
an ethical violation. As discussed later, you are allowed to collaborate with other
students as long as you are all making a good faith effort to do the work individually.
You cannot and should not violate the spirit of this privilege.
• Falsely or inaccurately claiming activity on assignments or recitation exercises or other
graded content. You should be aware that Canvas tracks ALL of your on-line activity,
including each time you have logged on, each click you have made, each
assignment/quiz you have opened, etc. Therefore, do not claim that you logged into
an assignment and submitted it before the due date when in fact you did not because
it is clear in Canvas that you did not.
• Completing the attendance survey if you did not attend the lecture.

Deliverables and Grades
Partial credit is not given on recitation exercises, assignments, or exams. The following
weights apply to determine your final score % in the course:
Attendance .10
Recitation exercises .10
Assignments .20
Exam 1 .30
Exam 2 .30
A letter grade is evaluated for both your final course score and your class rank percentile
based on the following table:
Course Grade Course Score Class Rank Percentile
A+ 95 – 100
A 90 – 95 75 % - 100 %
A- 85 – 90 55 % - 75 %
B+ 80 – 85 40 % - 55%
B 75 – 80 25 % - 40 %
B- 70 – 75 15 % - 25 %
C+ 65 – 70 5 % - 15 %
C or Lower 0 - 65 0 % - 5 %
We do not round final scores to determine either grade. The grade you receive for the course
is the better of those two letter grades. (Grades lower than C are based on instructor
judgment.)
To illustrate how your final course grade is determined, suppose your class rank percentile is
77.5% (i.e., your final score is greater than the score of 77.5% of the other students), and your
final score is 84.9. Based on the first, your grade is an A. Based on the second, your grade is a
B+. You, therefore, receive a final course grade of A, i.e., the better of the two.
Consider a second example in which your class rank percentile is 26%, and your final score is
again 84.9. Based on your class rank percentile, your grade is a B. Based on your final score, it
is a B+. Again, your final grade is the greater of the two, which is a B+
Attendance:
We will use polleverywhere to take attendance in each class session. You must be registered
with the course polleverywhere to be able to submit your poll responses. You receive 1 point
for completing the poll (i.e., you are not graded for accuracy) and 0 otherwise. There are 24
class sessions, but only the highest 20 scores are considered (i.e., you can miss four sessions
Page 7 of 10
during the semester without consequence). To state the obvious, it is an ethics violation if you
complete a poll without actual attendance. Furthermore, if you complete a poll, you are
expected to remain throughout the session to receive credit.
Recitation Exercises:
There are 13 recitation exercises, one for each week of the class. Your score on each recitation
is 10 minus the number of incorrect responses. For example, suppose there are 9 questions on
the recitation exercise and you answer 2 incorrectly. In that case, your score is 8 even though
Canvas will report your score as “7”. We are aware of this and will adjust your score
properly before calculating your grade. Recitation exercises are submitted via Canvas and are
due at 11:00 p.m. on the day of the recitation. Late submissions receive zero credit. We drop
the lowest two recitation scores before computing your final recitation score.
Assignments:
You are required to complete six graded assignments during this course. The questions on
these assignments are similar in nature to the questions on the exams. Like recitation
exercises, on each assignment, you receive 10 points minus the incorrect number of
responses.
To promote learning, you may collaborate and/or consult with other students registered this
semester in OIDD 1010 on these assignments. In other words, you are not cheating if you
discuss your solutions to these assignments with other students in this course. However,
each student must submit his or her own assignment.
All assignments are due by 11:00 p.m. of the assigned due date (see the course summary).
Late assignments are not accepted for credit (even partial credit). You submit your
assignments electronically via Canvas. Be sure to leave sufficient time in advance of when an
assignment is due in case you experience technical difficulties (e.g., the power on your laptop
dies, Wifi is down, etc.). In other words, technical difficulties do not excuse you from submitting on
time.
Exams:
There are two, non-cumulative examinations. Your exam score is 30 minus the number of
incorrect responses.
You may use during either exam one 8.5”x11” sheet of paper that contains your name and
whatever notes you wish to write on either side. You may handwrite your notes or have
them printed. You may only bring one sheet of paper—it is not acceptable to bring two
pieces of paper stapled together even if you write on only the outside of each sheet. During
the exam, you may not use any other notes, books, slides, handouts, etc.—your only source of
reference material is your one 8.5”x11” sheet of paper. 
Page 8 of 10
This sheet of paper is called a “reference sheet” because you refer to it and you are certainly
not cheating when you use it.
You may use a calculator (which includes graphing or programmable calculators) during the
exam. However, you may not use a computer, smart phone, iPod, or any electronic device
that runs Excel or can communicate with another electronic device.
Both exams are common exams—all sections take their exam at the same time.
If you have an exam or regularly scheduled course that conflicts with an OIDD 1010 exam,
then you should submit a request for an alternative time via a Canvas (non-graded)
quiz. You should submit your request no later than two weeks before the exam. In general,
you will take the OIDD 1010 exam in the two hours after the scheduled time for the exam,
and if that is not possible, you will take it during the two hours prior to the scheduled time.
If you cannot attend an exam for any other reason, then you must provide documentation as
to why you will not be able to attend (or were not able to attend). In general, excused
absences are given only for serious health issues. If you are granted an excused absence from
Exam 1, then you will need to make up the exam, or, if that is not possible, when Exam 1 is
offered in next semester. If you are granted an excused absence from Exam 2, then you will
take a make-up exam during the university’s scheduled make-up exam, which usually occurs
early in the next semester.
Grading:
Partial credit is not offered.
This means that you receive full credit for a response or zero credit and this applies for all
graded materials (e.g., recitation exercises, assignments, lectures).
Why do we do this? For one, we believe it is fair because it eliminates judgment calls as to
how “wrong” a response is. Second, it forces us to focus our questions on one concept rather
than trying to string a bunch of learning objectives into one question. Consequently, the
answer to one question is not needed as an input to another to avoid situations in which
getting one question wrong implies you get subsequent questions wrong as well (that would
be slimy, so we don’t do it). Put another way, we decouple questions to avoid that issue.
Finally, while there is a correct answer, we always allow for some tolerance to account for
minor rounding issues in the calculations. For example, we generally accept answers within
1% of the correct answer. To avoid being marked incorrect because of rounding, avoid
rounding intermediate calculations. For example, 1/3 and 0.3 are reasonably far off, and one
Page 9 of 10
shouldn’t be used for the other. We expect you to report your answers with at least two
decimal places.
Collaboration
To promote learning, you may collaborate and/or consult with other students registered this
semester in OIDD 1010 on recitation exercises and assignments. In fact, collaboration on
recitation exercises and assignments is encouraged. In other words, you are not cheating if
you discuss your solutions to recitation exercises or assignments with other students in this
course. You may not collaborate with another student on either of the exams.
Support Questions and Assistance
The mentoring sessions provide a regular meeting for the discussion of the weekly course
content. In addition to mentoring sessions, there are regular Teaching Assistant (TA) office
hours.
Concerns with Grading
If you have a question about your grade, please contact in writing (e.g., an email) the
appropriate Professor (i.e., the professor who taught you the material in question). Your
entire document will be reviewed. You may submit a request to review your assignment,
recitation exercise, or exam only within the two-week period after the assignment/recitation
exercise was due or the exam was taken.
Waivers and Prior Experience
Many of you have significant experience with computer technologies. A potentially
dangerous strategy is to assume that because you are technologically literate, you know
everything you need to know about business modeling and quantitative analysis. While our
goal is to make this class as accessible as possible to all students, it is very difficult to do well
if you rely only on prior knowledge and/or doing the readings on your own.
As a rule, we do not grant waivers of OIDD 1010 except for M&T students and dual degree
students who are receiving a degree from Engineering in addition to Wharton.

REAL 321/821 Real Estate Development Fall 2022 - Syllabus
Course Structure
Cases:
This course will make use of the case methodology, maximizing decision-making opportunities for you.
Nearly every week, students will be required to submit case write-ups either individually or in groups.
Additionally, students will be warm- and cold-called in class to begin a case or to answer questions
1
pertaining to the case. Class participation and preparation is critical, as we will focus on the development
process utilizing actual real estate projects. The class will compare and contrast many products and
processes over the course of the semester. Selected developers and professionals will participate in active
case analysis, underwriting, and discussion as opposed to “war story recitations”.
Lectures:
By reading, listening, and engaging in class lectures, we will study how to research and analyze real estate
investments, determine macro-economic trends, evaluate demographic and market data, and gather/review
comparables.
Guest Speakers:
Real Estate professionals/current practitioners will discuss various aspects of the development and real
estate industry and review their personal lessons, mistakes, and success stories with the class.
Pre- and Post-Lecture Discussions:
Students may be required to participate in online discussion boards every few weeks. Discussions will be
focused around concepts discussed in class and their relation to current events.
Group Final Project:
The class will split into groups of 3-5 and complete the work of a real estate developer. Each group is
expected to select a site/product of their choice and put to work class teachings in the form of an
investment memorandum and committee presentation. More details to follow.
Attendance:
Students are expected to attend all classes. Unexcused absences will result in points deducted from the
class participation component of your grade. Excused absences are reserved for serious illness, death in
the family, etc. Please reach out to Ryan Finvarb (rfinvarb@wharton.upenn.edu) if you anticipate missing
a class as early as possible.
1 Warm-call: Students will receive an email the morning of class, notifying them that they will be called upon in class to discuss some
topic pertaining to the case. This is a way to ensure that all students get the opportunity to participate.

Grading
Attendance: 10%
Participation: 20%
Case Assignments: 40%
Group Project – written: 15%
Group Project – presentation: 15%
Attendance
There are 12 classes throughout the semester. Please see below for the breakdown of attendance grading:
- Attending a class is awarded with +1 point.
- An excused absence and completion of a make-up assignment is awarded with +1 point.
- Unexcused absence with sufficient notification and completion of make-up assignment is
awarded with +0.5 points.
- Failure to complete make-up assignment is awarded with +0 points.
- Unexcused absence with no notification is penalized with -1 points.
Sufficient notification of absence is more than 24 hours before class time. You must email Ryan Finvarb
(TA) or Professor Feldman by Sunday at 10:30am, the day before class.
Participation
Participation is a fundamental part of this course. Students are expected to participate consistently
throughout the course. In an effort to ensure everyone gets enough “floor time”, we will be doing
warm-calls in which students are emailed the morning before class that they will be called to speak in
class. Additionally, there will be cold calls and normal participation in every class. On another note,
participation can be negatively affected by various distractions during class (i.e. on phone, computer,
etc.). Participation in periodic online discussion boards will also fall into this bucket.
Case Write-Ups
For each class in which a case study is assigned, students will be required to turn in a written memo
discussing and answering the case questions. Case write-ups will be graded on strength and conciseness
of analysis, organization, clarity, and grammar. Case grades will be based on answering the stated
questions and minimizing unnecessary, irrelevant, and unsupportive information. Examples from previous
years will be provided after the first case.
5
REAL 321/821 Real Estate Development Fall 2022 - Syllabus
We will vary between a portion of individual and group cases as indicated on the syllabus. For the group
case assignments, undergraduates and MBAs will be in separate teams. Teams will be assigned and will
consist of 3-4 students. For group cases, please turn in one copy per team with the names of all team
members listed on the first page. All papers must be typewritten. Students may drop their lowest
2
memo/paper grade for an individual case submission (i.e. team assignments may not be dropped).
Group Project
This assignment will serve as the final deliverable for the course. The class will self-divide into groups of
three to five people, ideally with a mix of business and design students in each group. The goal of this
project is to take course learning and apply it to a real-world situation. The project can be as “extensive”
as a ground-up development, or as “simple” as a rehab of an older asset. In either situation, groups are
expected to write a five to ten page investment memorandum detailing their development proposal –
Market Analysis, Development Strategy (Zoning, Entitlements, Approvals, Site Planning), Design,
Construction, Financing (Equity, Debt, Joint-Venture), Investment Model, and Sales/Leasing – as well as
prepare a ten-minute class presentation and slide deck. This presentation should be structured as though
the group is “presenting” the idea to the investment committee at their firm.
To make this assignment as “real life” as possible, actual practitioners and peers will sit in the class and
act as the investment committee for the presentation. Groups should be prepared for up to five minutes of
question and answers both during and/or after their presentation.
Projects will be judged on the following criteria:
- Clarity and conciseness of presented information;
- Strength of analysis;
- Ability to “sell” or make your case during a presentation;
- Thoroughness of research;
- Ability to answer questions;
- Feasibility of proposed strategy.
Re-Grade Policy
Students may request a regrade on all assignments. However, the regrade request:
- Must be accompanied by a clear and persuasive explanation for the request;
- Must be submitted within one week of having received the assignment back;
- Will result in the assignment being completely re-graded, and could, thus, receive a higher or
lower score.
Exams
There are no exams in this course.
2 Students will be penalized if all names are not on the first page.

REAL 321/821 Real Estate Development Fall 2022 - Syllabus
Deadlines
Deadlines are firm. Case Write-Ups are due before 10:30 AM of the class day when the case will be
discussed unless otherwise noted on the assignment sheet. Late papers for any reason are given a grade
off if submitted after 10:30 AM of the class day but before 3:30 PM of the class day. After class begins at
3:30 PM, a “No Credit” grade will be given. Insofar as this class helps prepare a student for “real
world” investments and “investment committee” presentations, deadlines must be met with no exceptions.
Submitting Assignments
All assignments must be submitted by uploading to the course site on Canvas. They must be formatted
such that the PPT/Word/Excel documents open and print when the print button is clicked. The instructor
will not spend additional time trying to open worksheets or to format documents to print. Said differently,
the instructor will open your submission and click the print icon. What gets printed will be graded so
please make sure that everything prints as you plan. Spreadsheets that require cutting and pasting to
read will not be graded so please make sure they are ‘fit to one page’ in a font that is readable. Group
assignments only need to be submitted once, but please clearly state group members on the cover sheet.
Please don’t submit a memo that you wouldn’t feel comfortable sending to the CEO of your future
employer.

count on receiving an email announcing class or assignment changes. Please make it a habit to check the
website every day or two. We will generally post presentations and guest speaker bios for upcoming
classes to make note taking more convenient. Projects and readings will also be posted if available in
electronic form.
Readings
The primary textbook is Professional Real Estate Development by Peiser and a reference textbook is Real
Estate Finance and Investments by Linneman. These texts will be used for general background
information. Other industry readings and news articles will frequently be assigned about one week before
they are covered in class.
Electronics
As the university, this class and working professionals continue to wrestle with the appropriate, or more
often inappropriate, use of Electronics in classrooms, meetings and board rooms, no such devices will be
used during class time. Students may have cell phones so they are reachable and breaks will be provided,
at least once during every class, to check emails and messages. Laptops and tablets will not be permitted
in the class as their use over the last few years has proved distracting to guests, classmates and to the
professor. Students are expected to come prepared to class to discuss the case assigned without the use of
a laptop or tablet.

REAL 321/821 Real Estate Development Fall 2022 - Syllabus
Prerequisites
Students are responsible for having completed Corporate Finance (FNCE203/601), or an equivalent.
Students are expected to have taken, or are taking concurrently with this course, Real Estate Investments
(REAL 209/721). The class will be taught assuming you have a working knowledge and understanding of
valuation techniques.
Academic Integrity
All relevant University policies regarding Academic Integrity must be followed strictly. Please review the
Code of Academic Integrity at:
http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/ai_codeofacademicintegrity.html
Other Administrative Matters
Please treat our classroom session as a board meeting - turn off all cell phones, tablets, and PDAs - do not
text, email, or visit websites during class or otherwise distract others.
Expectation of Mutual Respect
This class strives to be an inclusive community, learning from the many perspectives that come from
having differing backgrounds and beliefs. As a community, we aim to be respectful to all. Faculty and
students are expected to commit to creating an environment that facilitates inquiry and self-expression,
while also demonstrating diligence in understanding others’ viewpoints.
Wellness Statement
I am deeply aware of and sympathetic to the challenges that students may face both in and out of the
classroom. Mental health concerns or stressful events (e.g., a global pandemic) may lead to diminished
academic performance or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. Free, accessible,
confidential mental health services are available on campus (see the Counseling & Psychological Services
(CAPS) website at https://caps.wellness.upenn.edu/). Students should also feel free to reach out to discuss
any issues or request accommodations as necessary.

Introduction to Microeconomics
Term: Fall 2019 Instructor: Dr. Anne Duchene
Time: MW 910 (003) / 1011 (001) / 1112 (002) Oce: PCPSE 532

1 Course Description:
Welcome to Econ 001! This is an introductory undergraduate course that teaches the fundamentals of microeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of how individuals, households, rms and governments make choices,
and how these choices aect prices, the allocation of resources and the well-being of all agents. We will study
how the market forces of supply and demand cause prices to be what they are. We will then delve behind
the demand curve to see how consumers behave, and behind the supply curve to see how producers behave,
culminating in the model of perfect competition. We will study eciency in perfectly competitive markets, and
the impact of government intervention on eciency and equity. We will then see why markets may fail in the
presence of market power, externalities or public goods, and whether, when they fail, government intervention
may be needed to correct those failures. We will end the semester studying the market for labor and economic
inequality.
2 Course Structure:
1. Two lectures (Monday and Wednesday, 50 minutes each).
2. One recitation (Thursday or Friday, 50 minutes) with your recitation instructor (RI).
You should attend class every week (exam questions will assume you attended all lectures and recitations).
Lectures and recitations are complements: in lecture I will outline the big picture and conceptual framework,
and introduce the main ideas. However, I will not cover technical applications of the material due to lack of
lecture time. That will be done in recitation, where you will learn how to work problems of the kind that tend
to show up on exams, and push beyond the surface to achieve a deeper level of understanding.
3 Required Materials:
3.1 Canvas:
login in Canvas. This course website is very important for your study. I will post announcements, lecture slides,
recitation material, homework assignments, grades, etc. During class, I will not talk at a pace that allows you
time to copy all the material on lecture slides. I strongly suggest printing out the slides, placing them in a
binder, and then taking notes from class on the printouts.
3.2 Online combo: e-book / homework / in-class response system
This semester, we will be using the Top Hat digital learning platform which is comprised of this semester's
custom online textbook and the in-class response system we will be using:
page 1 of 10
ECON 001 Introduction to Microeconomics Fall 2019
• Custom-built interactive textbook: Top Hat Principles of Economics textbook (ISBN: 978-1-77330-093-1).
Don't worry if you don't see any content in the course right away, I will make it available to you as we
progress through the semester. Embedded within this text are interactive questions pertaining to the
readings, which will be factored into your overall grade for the course.
• Top Hat in-class response system (ISBN: 978-0-9866151-0-8) will allow you to answer in-lecture questions
via your mobile phone or laptop, which will also factor into your overall participation grade for the course.
When setting up your account, you must use your Penn ID(@upenn.edu) email address. Using an other email
address will result in you receiving NO credit for the Top Hat homework. An email invitation will be sent to
you by email, but if don't receive this email, you can register by simply visiting our course website and our
unique course join code. If you select the one-semester subscription option, you will be charged $71 at checkout
when attempting to access the course. Access cards (with codes that can be input at the checkout page) for the
textbook and in-class response system can also be purchased at the University of Pennsylvania bookstore, but
may be subject to a price mark-up. If you run into any problems signing for Top Hat or gaining access to the
course, email support@tophat.com.
3.3 Other optional (not required) textbook:
Microeconomics by Acemoglu, Laibson, and List, Pearson.

ECON 001 Introduction to Microeconomics Fall 2019
4.1 Homework
All due dates are on the last page of the syllabus. Late submissions will not be accepted under any circumstances
 even technical problems with your computer or with Internet connection. You should not leave the submission
to the last hour of the due date.
• Reading Assignments (with in-chapter questions):
 Due every Sunday at 11:59pm.
 Reading the e-book is required. There are built-in questions that you will answer as you read. You'll
be required to complete these questions every week as you read the chapter(s), before coming to class.
 Grading: You will be graded on your completion of the questions, rather than the accuracy of your
answers. So you can take these assignments seriously and complete them as they are intended (to
help with your comprehension), or you can just fake your way through these assignmentsit's up to
you as an adult learner. The total number of questions is 150. To get 100% credit, you must answer
(correctly or no) at least 120. If you answer less than 120 questions, your grade will be pro-rated.
For example, you will earn 80% if you answer 96 questions. If you answer more than 120 questions,
good for you! Nonetheless, the maximum credit is 120 points.
• End-of-chapter questions:
 Due every Friday at 11:59pm.
 Every week you will answer 25 end-of-chapter questions, after we complete the chapter in lecture and
recitation. These questions will be available a week in before the due date. You may complete them
in as many sittings as you want. That is, if you complete ve questions one day, and go back two
days later, your answers for those ve questions will still be there. Just make sure you complete all
25 questions on time!
 Grading: You will be graded based on correctness. There will be a total of 10 assignments, and
each assignment will be worth 25 points. To get the full 100% credit, you must accrue at least 200
points (out of 250 cumulative points available). If you accrue less than 200 points, your grade will
be pro-rated. For example, you will earn 80% if you accumulate 160 points. If you accumulate more
than 200 points, good for you! Nonetheless, the maximum credit is 200 points.
• Problem Sets:
 Due every Sunday at 11:59pm.
 Every week you will have a problem set on the topics covered that week. These problem sets are
similar in style and content to recitation questions. They require a deeper understanding of the
material and are a much closer match to exam questions than in-chapter and end-of-the chapter
questions. These assignments will be posted a week before their due date.
 Grading: You will be graded based on eorts. There will be a total of 9 problem sets, graded on a
scale of 0 to 3 (0= not answered / not submitted / submitted late, 1 = incomplete, little eort, 2 =
reasonable eort, 3 = excellent eort). To allow exibility, you will get the full 100% credit as long as
you accrue at least 20 points (out of 27 cumulative points available). I encourage you to work on the
problem sets with study partners or in groups, but every student should submit their own answers
on Canvas. If you get stuck on any part of the assignment you are welcome to stop by oce hours or
to ask your RI to go over a particular part or question in recitation.
If you join the class late (e.g. after week 2), you will receive 0 points for any homework assignments
you missed prior to enrolling in the class. No make-up opportunities will be provided.

ECON 001 Introduction to Microeconomics Fall 2019
4.2 Participation
• In lecture:
 Periodically we will use the Top Hat classroom response system in lecture. You will be able to
submit answers using Apple or Android smartphones and tablets, laptops, or via text message. These
questions will appear randomly, without notice, so please make sure to bring your laptop, tablet, or
other electronic device to all lectures!
 Grading: These questions are meant to ensure your presence in class, and to assess the general
understanding of the concepts. But they are not meant to test you individually. So each question
answered, correctly or not, will be worth 1 point. Up to three questions unanswered are factored in
without penalty, to account for technical problems and unavoidable absences. We will be running
trials to work out any technical problems.
 If you have a disability that aects your ability to complete these questions, please get documentation
to me as soon as possible. Under no circumstances should you submit responses for someone who is
not in class. That is cheating and will be dealt with as such.
• In recitation:
 Recitation attendance is mandatory, but recitation participation implies more than mere presence in
class. You are also expected to show up on time and prepared for class (read the recitation material
and try to solve it beforehand), and to be active in class. Any disruptive behavior in recitation will
be penalized.
 Grading: your Recitation Instructor will grade your participation at the end of the term. To allow
exibility, you can have up to 2 unexcused absences (out of 10 sessions  attendance will not be taken
the rst week of class) without being penalized.
4.3 Exams:
• There will be two non-cumulative midterms of 1 hour each and one cumulative nal exam of 2 hours.
• If you have a conict, email your RI by email at least one week prior to the exam date. If you have a
health/family emergency, also contact your RI. There is only one make-up exam oered for each midterm
(the next day) and for the nal (in January). Only students who have a valid reason to miss an exam are
qualied to take the make-up  see exams policy in section (8.3) of the syllabus for more details.
• All exams are no books, no notes, no calculators, no formula sheets. A practice exam will be available on
Canvas and RIs will hold review sessions before each exam.

ECON 001 Introduction to Microeconomics Fall 2019
6 How to succeed in Econ 001:
• The rule of thumb in college is that you study for at least 2 hours outside of class for each hour you spend
in class. This means you should spend a minimum of 6 hours per week studying for Econ 001. Please
know that it is highly unlikely that studying a lot the week before an exam will make up for not studying
enough in the weeks preceding the exam! You may have been able to get away with this in the past.
However, most ECON 001 students realize that this just doesn't work in economics or with the way in
which I teach and test.
• On a typical week:
 Sunday: read the textbook, answer the in-chapter questions, and try to get the main ideas: what are
the topics, what are the issues, and what are the main questions? What will the graphs look like,
what will the equations look like? What is the main message?
 Monday and Wednesday: go to lectures, and take notes on what is said or written or drawn during
class, not what is already on the slides. The lecture slides are posted on Canvas before class. Print
those out and bring them to the lecture. You can bring your laptop to class, but this course is very
graph intensive, and you simply cannot graph fast enough with a computer. So bringing a pen and
paper and printed slides might work best. Lecture recordings are available on Canvas shortly after
each lecture, so you can watch them if you miss a lecture or need to go back to it.
 Tuesday and Wednesday: go back to the textbook for detail. Now that you've skimmed once and
heard the lecture, you can read the textbook carefully and in depth (but do not try to memorize
it!). Write down what seems unclear and go to oce hours or ask your peers to clarify. Solve the
end-of-chapter questions in the textbook soon after the Monday and Wednesday lectures.
 Wednesday / Thursday: Prepare your recitation by trying to answer the recitation questions before
going there. You will not be tested on your answers but it is an excellent practice, as recitation
questions are similar to exam questions. In recitation, ask questions! They are a sign that you're
thinking, which is a good thing.
 From Thursday to Saturday: work on the problem set. They are of similar diculty as recitation
material exams, so you have to understand them. If you get stuck on any part of the problem et you
are welcome to stop by oce hours. We will not give you the answer but we can guide you in the
right direction.
• Throughout the semester:
 Get feedback as soon as you can: look up answers to homework and exams as soon as they are
released. Ask me or your TA if there is something you don't understand. The sooner you get the
feedback, the more solid the material will be in your mind.
 Form a small study group and make it a habit to meet at the same time each week. Study in groups.
You will learn a lot more if you are forced to explain things to classmates in your own words. But
always make sure that you try to answer the questions before you meet your study partners. That
way you will honestly know what you do and do not understand. The optimal study group size is 2-4
people.
 Practice! There is nothing like solving more and more questions to get the hang of this stu. You
will be given a link to copies of Econ 001 old exams with solutions on Canvas. Make sure you work
them and fully understand them. However, do not memorize answers, it will be useless! When you
practice, you must think of what you are doing and why. We ask for analysis and critical thinking
on exams, not just memorization. You cannot succeed in Econ 001 if you are on auto-pilot.

ECON 001 Introduction to Microeconomics Fall 2019
 If you nd yourself falling behind, please reach out to us. We are here to help and we want you to
succeed! Our oce hours (posted on Canvas) are when you are guaranteed to nd us. If you have a
conict, you may arrange a meeting time outside of oce hours.
 Every week I will post links to news articles. Read them! You will notice that as you read them every
week, there will be more and more articles where you think, ""hey we just learned about this in Econ
001!"". This is one of the major rewards of taking the class.
7 Whom to Contact:
• For questions on class material or general issues: go to oce hours. Oce hours will be held throughout
the week  the full schedule is on the Canvas homepage. You are welcome (and encouraged!) to stop by
any of our oce hours without making an appointment.
• For technical questions regarding grades or assignments, you should rst email your TA. If you do not get
a satisfactory or timely response, please email the email the ECON 1 team: econ-001@sas.upenn.edu. You
will get a response within one business day. Please note if the question is particularly long complex, you
might be redirected to oce hours, a recitation session or a review session.
• For scheduling issues: you should email Emily Romanello eroma@upenn.edu, the Undergraduate Coordinator
in the Economics department. Her oce is PCPSE 150.
• Special needs/arrangements for exams: anyone approved for accommodation with Student Disability
Services (SDS) must inform them of upcoming exams at least one week before the exam date. Failure to
do so will prevent the student from taking the accommodated exam.
• Issues with Canvas: go here and click Support for Students
• If you have personal questions (NOT related to the course), or if you have nancial diculties aording
the class material or other nancial hardships, you should email me directly at duchene@upenn.edu . From
Monday-Thursday, you should expect a response to your email within 24 hours. From Friday-Sunday and
on holidays you should expect a response within 48 hours.
• Read the syllabus. Most of your questions about the structure of the class are answered there.
page 6 of 10
ECON 001 Introduction to Microeconomics Fall 2019
8 Class Policy:
This syllabus is a contract. Deviation from these policies is not allowed.
8.1 Attendance
• Attendance is required. All absences are notied through the CAR (Course Absence Report) system.
The University keeps a long-term track of whether you have a tendency to get sick during exam times.
Attendance is required in this course. Course absences should be reported through the Course Absence
Report system. Students are permitted to miss class for legitimate reasons only (e.g., sickness on the day
of class). If the absence is more than ve days, you should contact your home school advising oce for
assistance and to discuss the academic implications of a longer absence. You can submit a Course Absence
Report by logging on to Penn InTouch and choosing the Course Absence Report option from the menu
on the left.
• If you miss class, you are responsible for making up any work and for knowing the material covered.
• Show up on time. Generally, be attentive during class. No distractions on your laptop for students sitting
behind.
8.2 Homework
• No late submission. Even technical problems with your computer or Internet connection are not acceptable
excuses. You have several days to submit each homework assignment; do not leave the submission to the
last hour of the last day that it is due.
• No extra credit: there is no extra credit in this course. The reason is that if everyone knows about it, it's
not really extra credit. It's just another assignment. If some people don't know about it (for instance, if a
specic student asks for extra credit at the end of the semester), then I'm treating my students dierently,
which I make every attempt to avoid.
8.3 Exams
• Makeup exams: There is only one make-up exam oered for each exam and only students who have a valid
reason (as dened by the University) to miss a midterm are qualied to take the make-up.
 Examples of valid excuses are:
∗ An exam is given outside of the regular class schedule and the timing conicts with another class
in which the student is enrolled.
∗ Observance of a university-recognized religious holiday.
∗ UPenn business that takes you away from campus (for example: athletic events in which you are
actively participating).
∗ An illness/health emergency.
∗ A death in your family.
 Examples that are not valid for missing an exam are:
∗ job internships;
∗ beginning the fall break early or returning after a scheduled exam;
∗ end of semester early ights;
page 7 of 10
ECON 001 Introduction to Microeconomics Fall 2019
 If you have a valid conict with both the exam date and the makeup date, please email your T.A. to
make arrangements for another time.
 For the nal exam only: If you have a conict with another nal exam or if you have more than
two nal exams scheduled in the same day and Econ 001 is the middle one, you are allowed to take
the Econ 001 nal exam at another time during the nal examinations period. If you have a conict
other than the ones just mentioned, you are required to take the makeup exam in the Fall.
• Regrade requests
 The regrade procedure is intended to correct serious errors in grading. It is not intended as a
opportunity to argue about each judgment call made by the graders. For each exam, a grading rubric
will be available on Canvas. If you nd a serious inconsistency between the way your exam was
graded and the grading rubric, we will look at your exam carefully. In that case, we reserve the right
to regrade the entire exam, which may result in either an increase or a decrease in your grade. We
are not trying to scare o students whose exams were graded incorrectly, but we are trying to avoid
frivolous requests.
 Examples of valid and invalid requests:
∗ Valid request: question X on my exam got 2 points less than what the grading policy suggests
∗ Invalid requests: I'd like my entire midterm to be regarded, or I believe your team allocated
too few points to this question on the exam
 How to request a regrade:
∗ If you feel that a regrade request is justied, print out the Regrade Request Form (available on
Canvas), ll it in (typed or very clearly handwritten), and staple it to the front of your exam. If
you like to use your old exams to study for the next one, make a copy for yourself before handing
it in. (It usually takes us a long time to do regrades.) Hand your exam and regrade form to your
RI during recitation or oce hours.
∗ Math errors: If there was an arithmetic error in adding up points on your exam, let any (not
necessarily your own) RI know right away (during recitation or oce hours), and they will record
the correct grade. This doesn't constitute a regrade request.
 The deadline for a regrade is one week after the return of the exams. If you need an extension, you
must ask your RI before the deadline. In any case, we will not regrade midterms right before / after
you take the nal.
 Unfortunately, there have been several instances in the past where students have modied an answer
after the exam had been graded, and then submitted the exam for a regrade. Because of this, we now
keep photos of exams before they are returned. Any indication that a regrade has been requested for
a modied exam will be considered cheating, and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.
• Academic Integrity: Penn has a clear Code of Academic Integrity. It's your responsibility to familiarize
yourself with the code, and to follow it to the letter. In particular, you are expected to maintain a
professional, respectful environment; be courteous to me and your RIs; not disrupt class (be quiet if
entering class late, turn o electronic devices, do not chat); Never present work that is not your own.
• Please refer to the Economics department policies.

 2  BIOLOGY 404  BASIC IMMUNOLOGY  Wednesdays  -  5:00 TO 8:50 PM   LECTURES HELD IN ROOM 109, LEIDY LABS   COURSE GOALS: The goals of this course are several: First, I hope to introduce you to basic principles and current concepts in the field of immunology.  Second, I would like to stimulate your thinking, especially from an experimental standpoint, about how these principles and concepts are formed. Finally, I hope you will leave with a foundation, for both the field of immunology and general experimental approaches, which will enable you to learn more on your own, through critical appraisal of the literature.   COURSE DESCRIPTION: The course will begin with a general overview of immunity, followed by in-depth considerations of the underlying cellular, molecular, and genetic events. Finally, later discussions will focus upon more specialized issues in immunology, such as disease states involving the immune system, as well as particularly interesting problems in modern immunology.   EXAMS: There will be two exams, EACH WITH A TAKE-HOME AND AN IN-CLASS PORTION. The exact format of these will be announced prior to each exam, but will be primarily  essay  or  brief  answer  questions.  Take-home  exams  will  be  distributed  two weeks  before  the  in-class  exam  dates,  and  must  be  turned  in  along  with  the  in-class exam.  Take-home exams will not be accepted late.  QUIZZES: There will be a quiz at the beginning of every session. These are mainly for self-evaluation,  and  can  only  improve  your  final  grade.  Each  will  be  corrected  and returned by the next class.   ONLINE THREADED DISCUSSION GROUPS: We will be utilizing the Canvas web site (https://canvas.upenn.edu/)  in  which  we  will  be  able  to  discuss,  as  a  group,  basic principles and problems  that  guide  our  current  understanding  of  the  immune system.  Each week the class will be given a question or problem to work on as a group. For some weeks, I  will  pose a question or  describe  an experiment and  then  each  member of the class will be expected to attempt to address the issue at hand online.  These are threaded discussions in the sense that all members of the class will be able to view, and respond to, comments made by others in the class or within their specified group.  In addition, it will be the job of the course director and teaching assistant to guide the discussion when appropriate.    We  may  also  have  certain  ""guests""  with  expertise  in  a  relevant  area  add comments.  I think that these exercises will be fun and will add to your understanding of scientific  principles  and  your  ability  to  learn  from  your  colleagues.    Participation  is mandatory:  Roughly 33% of your final grade will be derived from your participation, or lack thereof, in this site.    

 3  SCHEDULE:   Each session will be divided as follows:  * Up to the first 20 minutes will be devoted to an open discussion of the previous lecture/homework problems/quiz questions.   * The quiz (15 minutes) will be given and collected.  *A 10-minute break.  READINGS: Readings in the primary text are given in the table on page 6.   I strongly suggest  you  use  these,  as  you  see  fit,  to  strengthen  your  grasp  and  broaden  your perspective of the concepts conveyed in class.  TEXT:  The  recommended  text  is  Immunobiology  8th  edition,  by  Janeway  et  al., published by Garland Publishing, Inc.  Copies are available in the University bookstore.    ATTENDANCE: Attendance is not required, although participation in the quizzes will allow us to determine if excessive absences might be the basis for poor performance - and could mitigate against any special consideration if this is the case.    

 4  GRADING  The following  “straight scale” grading system will be used:      >97 = A+ 87-89 = B+ 77-79 = C+    93-96  = A 83-86 = B 73-76 = C <70 = D <60 = F 90-92  = A- 80-85 = B- 70-72 = C-          Throughout the course you may collect chips. At the end, you cash in your chips, and your grade will be computed by taking your total ""chips"" and dividing by 3.  CHIP  SOURCES  AND  MAXIMA Exams:  Each  exam  has  two  parts:  an  in-class  portion  consisting  of  short  answer questions  similar  to  the  quiz  questions  you  have  had,  and  a  take-home  portion consisting of  three sets of  essay questions. On  each take-home exam,  the question sets will be progressively more challenging. You may answer as many as one question from each set. The in-class portion of each exam is worth a maximum of 55 chips. The take-home questions are worth 15 chips/question. Thus, on each exam, the maximum from each take-home exam is 45 chips.  Threaded  Discussion  Groups:  There  will  be  8  threaded  discussions/debates,  each worth 10 chips for a total of 80 possible chips. At the end of the class your grade will be normalized to 100.  Each week you will be graded on your participation in these online discussions and debates of current topics in immunology.  Each discussion/debate will be posted by 10pm on the night of a lecture.  Responses from each individual registered for  the  class  are  due  by  10pm  the  following  Tuesday.  For  example,  the  first question/debate will be posted on May 25th and responses are due by 10pm on May 31st.    Quizzes: There will be 9 quizzes, each worth 10 chips.  At the end of the course, 20% of your quiz chips are added to your other chips PRIOR TO division by 3.  The maximum chips from quizzes is thus (90 X .20), or 18.  Therefore the maximum the quizzes  can add to your final grade is 18/3, or 6.0.

Text: Physics for Engineers and Scientists, Vol. 1, 3rd ed., by Ohanian
and Markert
Course Description: THIS COURSE may be used to fulfill three hours
of the Natural Science and Technology (Part I or Part II–CORE
component 030 or 031) component of the university core curriculum and
addresses the following four core objectives established by the Texas
Higher Education Coordinating Board: (1) communication skills, (2)
critical thinking skills, (3) teamwork, and (4) empirical and quantitative
skills. This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative
Reasoning courses are designed to equip you with skills that are
necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will
regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your
use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
This is a first semester calculus-based engineering mechanics course.
The course will cover materials described in Chapters 1-18 of the
textbook. Some material will be skipped. You are only responsible for
topics covered in class. A general Lesson Plan is given at the end of this
Syllabus.
Announcements: Announcements will be made in class as well as on
Quest (see below for description of this homework system).
Quest: This course makes use an online system, the web-based
Quest content delivery and homework server system maintained
by the College of Natural Sciences. This homework service will
require a $25 charge per student for its use, which goes toward the
maintenance and operation of the resource. 
Please go to http://quest.cns.utexas.edu/ to log in to the Quest
system for this class. At some point during the second or third
week, when you log into Quest, you will be asked to pay via credit
card on a secure payment site. You have the option to wait up to
15 days to pay while still continuing to use Quest for your
assignments. If you are taking more than one course using Quest,
you will not be charged more than $50/semester. Quest provides
mandatory instructional material for this course, just as is your
textbook, etc. For payment questions,
email quest.fees@cns.utexas.edu.
All course materials and course communication will be handled
through Quest. Check for announcements at the top of your Quest
page. Course materials may be found under the Course
Resources link in the left column.
Discussion Sessions: Each of you is registered for a discussion section,
and attendance is required. Roll will be taken. Each student’s discussion
section is determined by the specific unique number of their 303k section.
The Teaching Assistant runs all the discussion sessions. The first
Discussion Session will meet during the second week of the course.
Homework: The CNS Quest system is used for computer generated
homework assignments. The assignments are accessed using your web
browser, and your answers to the problems are submitted using your web
browser. The homework may consist of conceptual questions and
problems to be solved. Most answers are in multiple-choice format. To
use the Quest system go to https://quest.cns.utexas.edu/ and log in with
your UT EID. Generally homework assignments are weekly and usually
are due on Fridays at 11:55PM. The due date that appears on Quest is
the due date for that homework assignment, and it will be impossible
to submit your homework after the due date.
Examinations: Four exams and a final will be given. No makeup exams
will be given. The Quest system is used to generate the exams. Each
exam will contain basic conceptual questions and numerical or algebraic
problems. All will be in multiple-choice format and answered using
bubble sheets. For each exam you can use a calculator and a “crib sheet”
consisting of one 8.5 x 11 white sheet of paper with anything you care to
write on it. The “crib sheet” must be signed by you and turned in with
your bubble sheets. It will not be returned so make a copy if you wish to
keep it. The test dates are as follows: 
Final exam: Thursday, December 10, 2:00-5:00 pm
Extra Credit Assessment: a 20 minute Physics Assessment Test will be
given at the end of the semester. The results of the will help greatly in
our development of a placement test for all students who wish to register
for PHY 301 or PHY 303K. As a thank you for your time, a 1% extra
credit will be added to your semester grade for participating.
Basis of Grade: Best 3 of 4 exams, 40%; Homework, 25%; Final, 30%;
Discussion Session Attendance 5%
The percentage semester average on Quest is converted to Letter
Grades using a set of bounds for the letter grades. Typically the

GEO420K Intro. To Field and Stratigraphic Methods – Lab & Lecture Manual
COURSE OBJECTIVES
Why a class in geological field methods? Geology is first and foremost a field science. Field geology and
field geologists provide literally the ground truth for geologic concepts and theories of how the earth
works. The degree to which we, as geologists, are successful observers and interpreters of rocks in the
field depends in large measure on what we are prepared to see and record. The old adage “I wouldn’t
have believed it if I hadn’t seen it” is, in the case of field geology, more truthfully “I wouldn’t have seen
it if I hadn’t believed it”. We explore. We discover. Unfortunately, without sufficient experience and
preparation we can’t attach meaning to (and thus frequently ignore) what we don’t recognized or
understand. Discovery is, in part, “…seeing what everybody has seen, and thinking what nobody has
thought."" (A. Szent-Györgyi). From our vantage point, this requires a perspective acquired largely from
field experiences.
Paradoxically, we must also learn what to ignore; “Wisdom is learning what to overlook...” (W. James).
There is rarely, if ever, sufficient time for exhaustive field data collecting. As time permits, we thus
typically focus on a relatively few key aspects at a field site, paying less or no attention to the rest.
Anthropologists term this ability to recognize and sort the significant from the insignificant “professional
vision”. It is a crucial field skill that comes mostly from practical experience. You will begin to develop
your professional vision in this class.
Field proficiency has long been a distinguishing characteristic of our science. As a geoscientist, you are
expected to be a proficient scientific observer and recorder. Your unique skills and training in this area
separate you from lawyers, engineers, chemists and other professionals with whom you might one day
work. Without proper preparation, including a strong grounding in field methods, we would be little
better than rock hounds out for a day of casual collecting. Field geology is not merely collecting data
and samples; it is about making sense of the geology around you, about making geologic interpretations.
Landscapes are histories, with time marked by boundaries in the rocks, soil and sediment. A geologic
map or a measured section is the articulation of that history, with each line marking a before and after,
a hiatus that might last a second or a billion years. Through our maps and graphical logs, we represent
time as space. The ability to create, read and interpret such product is best developed from training and
practice in a field setting. It all begins by making and recording observations. An accurate record in the
form of a map, measured section, photograph, sketch, a carefully documented sample, field notes, etc.
provides a permanent, solid basis upon which to develop testable ideas and interpretations – the plot of
the story. Without such evidence, interpretations are fanciful fables; there is no scientific basis to
objectively evaluate them.

Successful field work depends greatly on how well we can formulate and test ideas while in the field.
Geology is rooted in the scientific method. The process of formulating and testing multiple working
hypotheses during field work is a distinctive, unique, vital aspect of our profession, one that can only be
taught and practiced while in the field.
LEARNING OUTCOMES
As suggested by the course name, this class contains two main components. This semester our principal
objectives are to: 1) learn and apply geologic field methods to describe, measure, map, sample and
report on rocks in the field and in the laboratory; 2) acquire an understanding of and learn how to apply
the elements of stratigraphy (e.g. what is a Formation? what are lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic and
chronostratigraphic units? what is a type section? how are rock units correlated?) and the field methods
upon which they are based. Like all sciences, geology has its own vocabulary. There is no better way to
learn a language than to be immersed in it, and field experiences, however brief, provide that
immersion.
GEO420K Intro. To Field and Stratigraphic Methods – Lab & Lecture Manual
It is often said “The best geologist is the one who has seen the most rocks” and there is much truth to it.
Four weekend field trips and a semester of labs will provide an introduction, the beginnings of a mental
catalog of rocks and field relationships that can provide a framework to build upon in future classes,
later field work and a future career in the geosciences.
TEACHING MODALITIES, PANDEMIC CONSIDERATIONS
As dictated by recent University policy, classes during the first two weeks of the semester this year
(January 18-28) will be taught remotely through Zoom. A link for these lectures is provided in Canvas, and
recordings of these and other MW lectures will be provided through the Canvas “Online Lectures” feature.
This is otherwise an in-person class only, with required attendance for all labs, lectures and field trips.
Disposable Nitril gloves, hand sanitizer and spray sanitizer will be available for use in all labs, some of
which require handling shared rock specimens and equipment. All lab and lecture rooms are large enough
to allow social distancing – please do so and wear a mask while indoors.

GEO420K – FIELD TRIP DATES
SPRING 2022
By registering for GEO 420K, you agree to be available for field trips on at least four weekends. The four
field trip weekends this semester for are:
Trip 1: February 12 OR 13 – Drs. Helper or Stockli
Trip 2: March 5 OR 6 – Dr. Helper or Dr. Stockli
Trip 3: April 9 OR 10– Dr. Malkowski or Dr. Kerans
Trip 4: April 23 OR 24 – Dr. Malkowski or Dr. Kerans
These dates are provided now so that you can plan your weekend activities accordingly. Unlike other
courses, the field trips are not supplementary to the classroom work; they are 48% of your grade. Your
attendance and participation in all field exercises are required for a passing grade, without exceptions.
Specific information for each trip, including which days you are expected to attend, will be posted on the
class Canvas site and can be found in the Lab/Field Trip Manual.
A list of materials needed for the field exercises, all contained in the required course packet available from
the Co-Op Art Supply store, is attached.
PANDEMIC CONSIDERATIONS
Your health and safety are our first and foremost concerns. We ask, out of respect for your fellow
classmates, TAs and faculty, whether fully vaccinated or not, that you please take a COVID test the
Thursday or Friday prior to each weekend field trip and let the faculty lead for the trip know ahead of the
trip if you test positive or have been recently (within 5 days) exposed to someone who has. For the same
reasons, we ask that you please wear a mask while traveling to and from the field sites, and while
gathered in close proximity in the field. After 3.5 semesters, you should now be well aware of the
University resources and recommendations for mitigating COVID spread; the Protect Texas Now App
provides a gateway to most, including routine Proactive Community Testing (PCT). The UT COVID-19
Exposure Action Chart is an important new addition resource that can help you decide how to proceed
with 1) Assymptomatic Close Contact Exposure, 2) Symptoms, or 3) a positive COVID test.

Under the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, have you persuaded yourself that
there are knowledges and truths beyond your grasp, things that you simply cannot learn?
Have you allowed adverse evidence to pile up and force you to conclude that you are not
mathematical, not linguistic, not poetic, not scientific, not philosophical? If you have
allowed this to happen, you have arbitrarily imposed limits on your intellectual freedom,
and you have smothered the fires from which all other freedoms arise.

Prerequisites:
Prerequisite and degree relevance: Either a 560 on the Mathematics IC Test or 560 on
Mathematics Level IIC, or a grade of at least C in M304E or M305G.
Note: Students who score less than 600 on the Mathematics Level IC Test should be aware that
studies show taking M305G first is likely to improve their grade in M408C.
Only one of the following may be counted: M 403K, 408C, 408K, 308K. 
M408C Treisman Fall 2012 2
M408C and M408D (or the equivalent sequence M408K, M408L, M408M) are required of
mathematics majors, and mathematics majors are required to make grades of C or better in these
courses. Any student who does not have the prerequisites for this course, or who has received
credit for any of the courses listed above, must see an advisor as soon as possible.
Students enter Math 408C with a great diversity of mathematics backgrounds. Many have taken
four years of mathematics plus Advanced Placement Calculus in high school; others may have
only taken two years of high school algebra and one year of high school geometry. Still others
will have taken Precalculus (Mathematics 305G) at UT Austin or at a community college. And,
some will be repeating M408C for a second or third time. Our sections require only that you
have met the official prerequisites for the course. Our aim is to help every one of you to
excel and to develop both the desire and the necessary skills to successfully continue your study
of mathematics and mathematics-dependent subjects. Professor Treisman will arrange extra
sessions for students who have had no prior exposure to Calculus. These students should make it
a special priority to attend Prof T’s office hours and his many extra review sessions. Finally,
students with no prior coursework in Calculus will have extra opportunities to earn points toward
their final grade.
Quantitative Reasoning Flag Course:
This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed
to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments
you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real- world problems.
Course Description:
M408C is the first semester of our standard first-year calculus sequence. It is designed for
students with interests in the mathematical, natural, and social sciences as well as for prospective
engineers and architects. This section of M408C is designed to help students develop:
(1) a conceptual understanding of the major ideas of differential and integral calculus,
(2) technical facility with its techniques and theorems, and
(3) the ability to use these techniques and theorems to solve a variety of standard and nonstandard problems.
The focus of this first calculus course is not on theory. However, because proof is so central to
later mathematical work, we will take a rigorous approach to the theory of limits and you will
learn how to prove the basic theorems that underlie important computational techniques.
Students will also learn to use the main course theorems to prove their important corollaries.
Calculus is a beautiful and venerable subject that provides powerful tools for analyzing the
behavior of functions—that is, the ways that changes in certain quantities affect changes in one
or more other quantities. These tools—developed in the seventeenth century and refined over
the next quarter of a millennium—represent one of civilization’s greatest intellectual
achievements. Calculus makes possible a concise and accurate description of the motion of
heavenly bodies, of basic economic principles, and of countless other phenomena in which
change and interdependence are central.
Calculus often allows us to compute the past and future states of a system, and here lies one
source of its power. It allows us to find desirable states of systems such as when one important
quantity takes its largest or smallest value, or moves at its greatest velocity, or just plain stops
changing for a spell. Often, when using the tools of calculus, one discovers that two systems or
phenomena, which appear at first to be completely unrelated, have exactly the same underlying
structure so that intuition in one domain allows us to better understand the other. This discovery 
M408C Treisman Fall 2012 3
of surprising similarities, that by looking through the lens of mathematics one can often see
unity, is one of the special pleasures of our subject and one of the reasons that drive some to
choose mathematics as their profession. We hope that, at semester’s end, you will have a sense
of the power of The Calculus and a growing appreciation for its beauty. Welcome to the
community of mathematicians.

Learning Calculus and the Role of the Professor and Teaching Assistant:
I was unable to find flaws in my 'proof' for quite a while, even though the error is very
obvious. It was a psychological problem, a blindness, an excitement, an inhibition of
reasoning by an underlying fear of being wrong. Techniques leading to the abandonment
of such inhibitions should be cultivated by every honest mathematician.
— John Stallings, one of my math professors at UC Berkeley, in an article on how he
failed to prove the Poincaré conjecture
Experience has taught us that mastering the content of M408C requires that students spend
many, many hours solving calculus problems and studying the textbook. We strongly
recommend getting to know some of your classmates and spending lots of time with them
working through hard problems, comparing notes on homework, and studying for examinations.
You should also make good use of our office hours, of the online Dana Center/Agile Mind
resources, and of the many other resources available on campus. We estimate that “A” students
will spend at least 15 hours a week studying for this course in addition to the time spent in
lecture and section. Of special importance is making sure you do not fall behind. The pace of
M408C is brisk; it’s hard to catch up. If you feel that your performance is slipping, come and
see us as soon as possible. If the professor or teaching assistant thinks that your performance is
slipping, one of us will hunt you down. Our goal is to help you all excel in this course. We need
your cooperation.
In lecture, we will not cover everything in the textbook, but rather, will spend most of the time
exploring difficult points and interesting problems, and working together on exercises that will
help us help you learn calculus. Do not expect a 75-minute lecture; they will rarely be given. Typically, the content covered in a lecture will be useful to completing a subsequent homework
assignment. But, occasionally, I will assign homework problems on material not yet covered in
lecture. This is one among many signals to you that the course syllabus has been specified and
that you are largely responsible for learning the basic material on your own and in collaboration
with your peers and teaching assistants. As the course progresses you will be responsible for
learning more and more of the basic material independently, but fear not—the teaching assistants
and I will be there to support you whenever you have trouble.
I expect many of you to be regulars at my office hours—that’s where we get to work on
problems in depth and where I can be responsive to your individual needs. Besides, as you’ll
discover, I’m quite witty and charming—and humble too!
The purpose of discussion sections is not only to respond to your individual questions, but also to
afford you an opportunity to work with your peers on the kinds of problems that will appear on
the course examinations. You’ll find your teaching assistant to be an invaluable resource for
helping you to excel in the course.
We expect you to come to every lecture and discussion section prepared to do mathematics.
Your running point total (as described below) will be posted on a secure part of the course
website. You’ll need to sign in with your UT EID and password to access your scores. No other
student can access your scores.

D 600 to 649
F below 600
During the 15 weeks of instruction, points can be earned in many ways:
up to 100 points on in-lecture spot quizzes,
up to 200 points on homework,
up to 100 points on Chapter 2 Quiz,
up to 250 points on Midterm I,
up to 250 points on Midterm II,
up to 100 points for high quality participation and engagement in your discussion section,
In addition, there are many ways to earn up to as many as 200 extra credit points.
However, only up to 1,000 points earned during the 15 weeks of instruction will be counted
toward your final point total. Nota bene: Even if you earn 1,200 points only 1,000 will be
counted toward your final point total.
You can earn up to 300 points on the final exam and these will count toward your final point
total.
In other words, you cannot earn an A- or A in the course if you do not take the final exam.
It will be near impossible to earn an A without doing lots of extra credit work.
Note that you are not competing with your classmates. I’ve designed the grading system—an
absolute scale—explicitly to promote collaboration in learning calculus.
Exams will be challenging, but there will be few surprises, and conscientious studying should
produce A-level work. I gladly give partial credit for work that is partially correct. Midterms
and the final exam must be written in 8 x 10” bluebooks available at many on- and off-campus
stores. Be a sport and bring an extra one to exams for those who forget.

How badly do I want you to excel in this course? If all the students in any section earn an A in
the course, that is, earn 1100 points or more, the students in that section can pick any restaurant
in Austin for a celebration—and dinner is on me. This has happened three times since I began
teaching at UT in fall 1991.
M408C Treisman Fall 2012 6
Class Leadership Team:
By week three of the course, each section must elect a student section leader. The student
section leaders will meet with me 4 times throughout the semester to give me advice on
improving the course. They will survey their fellow students and otherwise engage in activities
to surface class problems and opportunities. I will provide lunch, snacks of whatever form of
bribery is necessary to help you help me to make this a great semester.
Earning Points and Grading Policies
In-lecture spot quizzes (100 points):
Thirteen times in lecture I will give a two-minute quiz designed to be very easy for those who
have prepared for class by reading the assigned material—and designed to be very challenging
for those who did not do so. Each quiz will be worth up to ten points with partial credit given.
Most of these one-item quizzes will ask you to state a definition or theorem in the required
reading or, perhaps, to solve an elementary problem worked out in the assigned section of text.
The ten highest scores will be added to determine your score in this category. Since there will be
13 quizzes and only the top ten count, there will be no quiz makeups. Again, no make-ups will
be offered for this point-earning category. Occasionally, the class assistant will grant you more
than 10 points for superior work on your quiz, but your maximum total in this grading category
remains 100 points.
Homework (up to 100 points for book problems and up to 100 points for Quest problems):
Learning calculus requires developing computational fluency with important algorithms,
developing a deep conceptual understanding of a beautiful set of ideas, and learning to apply
these ideas and algorithms to both classical and novel problems. You can only achieve this
through lots of practice, made with pencil (and, often, graphing calculator) in hand. One way to
organize this necessary work is by being diligent at doing homework. There’s lots of it; ain’t no
way around that. There will be approximately 27 homework assignments, each of which will
require approximately five hours of work.
Each homework assignment will consist of the following:
 3–6 difficult problems assigned from the textbook. Your work must be submitted on
8 ½ x 11” paper, stapled in the upper left corner. Be sure to include your name and
section number on each page. This makes it easier for us to keep track of 130+
students’ work.
 Approximately 10–20 additional problems administered through the Quest Learning and
Assessment System. The Quest website is available at http://quest.cns.utexas.edu.
Required Notice Regarding Quest: This course makes use of the web-based Quest
content delivery and homework server system maintained by the College of Natural
Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin. This homework service will require a $25
charge per student for its use, which goes toward the maintenance and operation of the
resource. Please go to http://quest.cns.utexas.edu to log in to the Quest system for this
class. At some point during the second or third week, when you log into Quest, you will
be asked to pay via credit card on a secure payment site. You have the option to wait up
to 15 days to pay while still continuing to use Quest for your assignments. If you are
taking more than one course using Quest, you will not be charged more than
$50/semester. Quest provides mandatory instructional material for this course, just as is
your textbook, etc. For payment questions, email quest.billing@cns.utexas.edu.
Write neatly!!! Reading homework assignments is painstakingly hard work. Be kind to the
grader and to your professor, who will occasionally read a sample of homework papers. The
grader has the authority to give zero points to illegible homework assignments.
M408C Treisman Fall 2012 7
Nota Bene: On each assignment from the textbook only one problem will be graded. You will
not know which one it is in advance. Credit is given for the solution to a problem, not for the
answer, which you will often be able to find in the back of the textbook.
Each homework assignment on Quest is worth up to 5 points. If you score 100%, then you will
earn 5 points. If you score 50%, then you will earn 2.5 points, etc..
Your final homework score is the sum of your 20 highest homework grades from the textbook
plus your 20 highest homework grades from Quest (maximum of 200 points).
Chapter 2 Quiz (up to 100 points):
This quiz will test your knowledge of the material on chapter 2.
Midterm I: (up to 250 points):
This midterm will consist of four questions on the material in Topics I and II.
 Question 1 (4 parts, each worth 20 points, for a total of 80 points) will test your
computational skills.
 Question 2 (60 points) will be a modified version of an assigned (challenging)
homework problem.
 Question 3 (60 points) will be a modified version of a problem worked out in the
assigned sections of the text.
 Question 4 (50 points) A wild card!
Midterm II: (up to 250 points):
This midterm will consist of five questions on the material in Topics III, IV, inverse functions,
and logarithms.
 Question 1 (4 parts each worth 20 points for a total of 80 points). This question will test
your computational skills.
 Question 2 (40 points) will be a modified version of an assigned (challenging)
homework problem.
 Question 3 (40 points) will be a modified version of a problem worked out in the
assigned sections of the text.
 Question 4 (40 points) will be a modified version of a problem chosen from a list of 15
hard problems that will be distributed two weeks before the examination.
 Question 5 (50 points) A wild card!
Final Examination (up to 300 points):
The structure of the comprehensive final exam will be discussed in class.
Exam Make-Up policy:
Midterm I: If, for documented health reasons, a student misses Midterm I, then a make-up exam
will be provided at a time convenient to both student and professor.
Midterm II: If, for documented health reasons, a student misses Midterm II, then a make-up
exam will be provided at a time convenient to both student and professor.
Final Exam: If, for documented health reasons, a student misses the Final Exam, the student will
receive an Incomplete in the course. The grade will be determined after the student completes a
make-up final at a time convenient to both student and professor.
Make-up examinations will be taken in Professor Treisman’s Dana Center office at
1616 Guadalupe, Room 3.206 (UTA bldg) and will be proctored by Professor Treisman’s staff.
Nota bene: No make-ups for in-class spot quizzes or for homeworks.
M408C Treisman Fall 2012 8
Discussion Section (up to 100 points):
Your discussion section instructor will evaluate the quality of your participation in section. We
expect you to come prepared to work on problems from the assigned reading, to collaborate with
your classmates on hard problems, and to seek our help and extra challenges when needed. They
may choose to give you quizzes or special assignments on which they base the number of points
you earn in this category. These points, if any, will be awarded at the end of the semester.
Earning Extra Credit (up to 200 points):
Agile Mind (up to 100 points of extra credit): Students will be given passwords to this online
support system for learning calculus developed by Prof Treisman and his colleagues. The
service consists of more than 25 units on the main course topics together with helpful
animations, simulations, and problem sets. The service keeps track of your work and allows the
professor and TA to view your progress as well as the time spent on each task. We will
demonstrate the service in class and will distribute a sheet describing how to earn extra credit.
Students can earn up to 4 extra credit points for each online unit completed (up to a maximum of
100 points), if the unit is completed by the announced deadline. A completed unit represents
approx. 40–90 minutes of work. More information will be provided when the online system is
demonstrated in class. Your work will be graded by the course Famulus minor and her decisions
are final!
Special Sessions: The UT Sanger Learning Center offers review classes that are often excellent.
Every student is provided five free one-on-one tutoring sessions. It would be foolish not to use
them. I will grant extra credit for attending some of these. I will also grant extra credit for
attending some of my extra evening and weekend study sessions. Details to be given in lecture.
Classroom Participation: To encourage you to participate in class, I will often give students extra
credit points for astute comments made in class.
Special Extra Credit Projects: There will be three special opportunities to earn extra credit, each
of which will be worth up to 15 points for exceptional work. Details and a schedule will be
provided in lecture.
1. Laboratory Project on page 256.
2. With a group of 4–6 classmates, go to a cultural event on campus that you would not
ordinarily attend. Write a group essay on your experience. Choose classmates that you do
not know well. As a matter of respect, you may not chose a religious event.
3. Every year I write letters to high school teachers who have been identified by my students as
having a powerful effect on their mathematical knowledge and affection for the subject.
Write a two-page letter nominating one of your high school teachers for this honor.
Attendance Policy:
Attending lectures in a University requirement. I understand that there are legitimate reasons for
occasionally missing a class or a discussion session. I expect you to email me in advance of any
anticipated class absences. I do worry about you all and want to ensure you’re OK. It is
unimaginable that you could pass this course without near perfect attendance.
Religious Holidays:
I respect your religious beliefs and practices and will make accommodations for students who
choose to miss a class in observance of a holiday. You need to inform me by email at least two
days in advance if you will miss class for religious reasons, so that I can arrange appropriate
accommodations, make-up quizzes, etc.
M408C Treisman Fall 2012 9
Special Accommodations:
Students with special challenges or disabilities should notify the professor and the TA at the
beginning of the semester, so that we can work together to create the conditions that allow you to
excel in this class. The UT campus has an excellent office that provides services and special
accommodations for students with disabilities. You can contact this office at 471-6259 or
videophone at 866-327-8877 (then dial 512-232-2937).
Athletes: Please let me know as soon as possible when you will miss class. Hook‘em Horns.
Academic Integrity:
I have organized this class to encourage students to work together and to help each learn
calculus. I especially encourage students to work together on their homework and to check each
other’s work before handing in assignments. With this exception, I expect that all written work
submitted to the professor or the TA to be each student’s own work. I tolerate no cheating on
examinations. Students should read the University rules on scholastic dishonesty, which can be
found on the Student Judicial Services website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.",,"M408C: DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS Fall 2012
 Under the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, have you persuaded yourself that
 there are knowledges and truths beyond your grasp, things that you simply cannot learn?
 Have you allowed adverse evidence to pile up and force you to conclude that you are not
 mathematical, not linguistic, not poetic, not scientific, not philosophical? If you have
 allowed this to happen, you have arbitrarily imposed limits on your intellectual freedom,
 and you have smothered the fires from which all other freedoms arise.

 Prerequisites:
 Prerequisite and degree relevance: Either a 560 on the Mathematics IC Test or 560 on
 Mathematics Level IIC, or a grade of at least C in M304E or M305G.
 Note: Students who score less than 600 on the Mathematics Level IC Test should be aware that
 studies show taking M305G first is likely to improve their grade in M408C.
 Only one of the following may be counted: M 403K, 408C, 408K, 308K. 
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 2
 M408C and M408D (or the equivalent sequence M408K, M408L, M408M) are required of
 mathematics majors, and mathematics majors are required to make grades of C or better in these
 courses. Any student who does not have the prerequisites for this course, or who has received
 credit for any of the courses listed above, must see an advisor as soon as possible.
 Students enter Math 408C with a great diversity of mathematics backgrounds. Many have taken
 four years of mathematics plus Advanced Placement Calculus in high school; others may have
 only taken two years of high school algebra and one year of high school geometry. Still others
 will have taken Precalculus (Mathematics 305G) at UT Austin or at a community college. And,
 some will be repeating M408C for a second or third time. Our sections require only that you
 have met the official prerequisites for the course. Our aim is to help every one of you to
 excel and to develop both the desire and the necessary skills to successfully continue your study
 of mathematics and mathematics-dependent subjects. Professor Treisman will arrange extra
 sessions for students who have had no prior exposure to Calculus. These students should make it
 a special priority to attend Prof T’s office hours and his many extra review sessions. Finally,
 students with no prior coursework in Calculus will have extra opportunities to earn points toward
 their final grade.
 Quantitative Reasoning Flag Course:
 This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed
 to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments
 you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a
 substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real- world problems.
 Course Description:
 M408C is the first semester of our standard first-year calculus sequence. It is designed for
 students with interests in the mathematical, natural, and social sciences as well as for prospective
 engineers and architects. This section of M408C is designed to help students develop:
 (1) a conceptual understanding of the major ideas of differential and integral calculus,
 (2) technical facility with its techniques and theorems, and
 (3) the ability to use these techniques and theorems to solve a variety of standard and nonstandard problems.
 The focus of this first calculus course is not on theory. However, because proof is so central to
 later mathematical work, we will take a rigorous approach to the theory of limits and you will
 learn how to prove the basic theorems that underlie important computational techniques.
 Students will also learn to use the main course theorems to prove their important corollaries.
 Calculus is a beautiful and venerable subject that provides powerful tools for analyzing the
 behavior of functions—that is, the ways that changes in certain quantities affect changes in one
 or more other quantities. These tools—developed in the seventeenth century and refined over
 the next quarter of a millennium—represent one of civilization’s greatest intellectual
 achievements. Calculus makes possible a concise and accurate description of the motion of
 heavenly bodies, of basic economic principles, and of countless other phenomena in which
 change and interdependence are central.
 Calculus often allows us to compute the past and future states of a system, and here lies one
 source of its power. It allows us to find desirable states of systems such as when one important
 quantity takes its largest or smallest value, or moves at its greatest velocity, or just plain stops
 changing for a spell. Often, when using the tools of calculus, one discovers that two systems or
 phenomena, which appear at first to be completely unrelated, have exactly the same underlying
 structure so that intuition in one domain allows us to better understand the other. This discovery 
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 3
 of surprising similarities, that by looking through the lens of mathematics one can often see
 unity, is one of the special pleasures of our subject and one of the reasons that drive some to
 choose mathematics as their profession. We hope that, at semester’s end, you will have a sense
 of the power of The Calculus and a growing appreciation for its beauty. Welcome to the
 community of mathematicians.

 Learning Calculus and the Role of the Professor and Teaching Assistant:
 I was unable to find flaws in my 'proof' for quite a while, even though the error is very
 obvious. It was a psychological problem, a blindness, an excitement, an inhibition of
 reasoning by an underlying fear of being wrong. Techniques leading to the abandonment
 of such inhibitions should be cultivated by every honest mathematician.
 —  , one of my math professors at UC Berkeley, in an article on how he
 failed to prove the Poincaré conjecture
 Experience has taught us that mastering the content of M408C requires that students spend
 many, many hours solving calculus problems and studying the textbook. We strongly
 recommend getting to know some of your classmates and spending lots of time with them
 working through hard problems, comparing notes on homework, and studying for examinations.
 You should also make good use of our office hours, of the online Dana Center/Agile Mind
 resources, and of the many other resources available on campus. We estimate that “A” students
 will spend at least 15 hours a week studying for this course in addition to the time spent in
 lecture and section. Of special importance is making sure you do not fall behind. The pace of
 M408C is brisk; it’s hard to catch up. If you feel that your performance is slipping, come and
 see us as soon as possible. If the professor or teaching assistant thinks that your performance is
 slipping, one of us will hunt you down. Our goal is to help you all excel in this course. We need
 your cooperation.
 In lecture, we will not cover everything in the textbook, but rather, will spend most of the time
 exploring difficult points and interesting problems, and working together on exercises that will
 help us help you learn calculus. Do not expect a 75-minute lecture; they will rarely be given. Typically, the content covered in a lecture will be useful to completing a subsequent homework
 assignment. But, occasionally, I will assign homework problems on material not yet covered in
 lecture. This is one among many signals to you that the course syllabus has been specified and
 that you are largely responsible for learning the basic material on your own and in collaboration
 with your peers and teaching assistants. As the course progresses you will be responsible for
 learning more and more of the basic material independently, but fear not—the teaching assistants
 and I will be there to support you whenever you have trouble.
 I expect many of you to be regulars at my office hours—that’s where we get to work on
 problems in depth and where I can be responsive to your individual needs. Besides, as you’ll
 discover, I’m quite witty and charming—and humble too!
 The purpose of discussion sections is not only to respond to your individual questions, but also to
 afford you an opportunity to work with your peers on the kinds of problems that will appear on
 the course examinations. You’ll find your teaching assistant to be an invaluable resource for
 helping you to excel in the course.
 We expect you to come to every lecture and discussion section prepared to do mathematics.
 Your running point total (as described below) will be posted on a secure part of the course
 website. You’ll need to sign in with your UT EID and password to access your scores. No other
 student can access your scores.
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 5
 Grading Scheme:
 Your final grade in M408C will be determined by the number of points you earn on the
 following scale:
 A 1100 or higher
 A– 1025 to 1099
 B+ 975 to 1024
 B 900 to 974
 B– 850 to 899
 C+ 800 to 849
 C 750 to 799
 C– 700 to 749
 D+ 650 to 699
 D 600 to 649
 F below 600
 During the 15 weeks of instruction, points can be earned in many ways:
 up to 100 points on in-lecture spot quizzes,
 up to 200 points on homework,
 up to 100 points on Chapter 2 Quiz,
 up to 250 points on Midterm I,
 up to 250 points on Midterm II,
 up to 100 points for high quality participation and engagement in your discussion section,
 In addition, there are many ways to earn up to as many as 200 extra credit points.
 However, only up to 1,000 points earned during the 15 weeks of instruction will be counted
 toward your final point total. Nota bene: Even if you earn 1,200 points only 1,000 will be
 counted toward your final point total.
 You can earn up to 300 points on the final exam and these will count toward your final point
 total.
 In other words, you cannot earn an A- or A in the course if you do not take the final exam.
 It will be near impossible to earn an A without doing lots of extra credit work.

 Midterm II: If, for documented health reasons, a student misses Midterm II, then a make-up
 exam will be provided at a time convenient to both student and professor.
 Final Exam: If, for documented health reasons, a student misses the Final Exam, the student will
 receive an Incomplete in the course. The grade will be determined after the student completes a
 make-up final at a time convenient to both student and professor.
 Make-up examinations will be taken in Professor Treisman’s Dana Center office at
 1616 Guadalupe, Room 3.206 (UTA bldg) and will be proctored by Professor Treisman’s staff.
 Nota bene: No make-ups for in-class spot quizzes or for homeworks.

 Discussion Section (up to 100 points):
 Your discussion section instructor will evaluate the quality of your participation in section. We
 expect you to come prepared to work on problems from the assigned reading, to collaborate with
 your classmates on hard problems, and to seek our help and extra challenges when needed. They
 may choose to give you quizzes or special assignments on which they base the number of points
 you earn in this category. These points, if any, will be awarded at the end of the semester.
 Earning Extra Credit (up to 200 points):
 Agile Mind (up to 100 points of extra credit): Students will be given passwords to this online
 support system for learning calculus developed by Prof Treisman and his colleagues. The
 service consists of more than 25 units on the main course topics together with helpful
 animations, simulations, and problem sets. The service keeps track of your work and allows the
 professor and TA to view your progress as well as the time spent on each task. We will
 demonstrate the service in class and will distribute a sheet describing how to earn extra credit.
 Students can earn up to 4 extra credit points for each online unit completed (up to a maximum of
 100 points), if the unit is completed by the announced deadline. A completed unit represents
 approx. 40–90 minutes of work. More information will be provided when the online system is
 demonstrated in class. Your work will be graded by the course Famulus minor and her decisions
 are final!
 Special Sessions: The UT Sanger Learning Center offers review classes that are often excellent.
 Every student is provided five free one-on-one tutoring sessions. It would be foolish not to use
 them. I will grant extra credit for attending some of these. I will also grant extra credit for
 attending some of my extra evening and weekend study sessions. Details to be given in lecture.
 Classroom Participation: To encourage you to participate in class, I will often give students extra
 credit points for astute comments made in class.
 Special Extra Credit Projects: There will be three special opportunities to earn extra credit, each
 of which will be worth up to 15 points for exceptional work. Details and a schedule will be
 provided in lecture.

 2. With a group of 4–6 classmates, go to a cultural event on campus that you would not
 ordinarily attend. Write a group essay on your experience. Choose classmates that you do
 not know well. As a matter of respect, you may not chose a religious event.
 3. Every year I write letters to high school teachers who have been identified by my students as
 having a powerful effect on their mathematical knowledge and affection for the subject.
 Write a two-page letter nominating one of your high school teachers for this honor.
 Attendance Policy:
 Attending lectures in a University requirement. I understand that there are legitimate reasons for
 occasionally missing a class or a discussion session. I expect you to email me in advance of any
 anticipated class absences. I do worry about you all and want to ensure you’re OK. It is
 unimaginable that you could pass this course without near perfect attendance.
 Religious Holidays:
 I respect your religious beliefs and practices and will make accommodations for students who
 choose to miss a class in observance of a holiday. You need to inform me by email at least two
 days in advance if you will miss class for religious reasons, so that I can arrange appropriate
 accommodations, make-up quizzes, etc.
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 9
 Special Accommodations:
 Students with special challenges or disabilities should notify the professor and the TA at the
 beginning of the semester, so that we can work together to create the conditions that allow you to
 excel in this class. The UT campus has an excellent office that provides services and special
 accommodations for students with disabilities. You can contact this office at 471-6259 or
 videophone at 866-327-8877 (then dial 512-232-2937).
 Athletes: Please let me know as soon as possible when you will miss class. Hook‘em Horns.
 Academic Integrity:
 I have organized this class to encourage students to work together and to help each learn
 calculus. I especially encourage students to work together on their homework and to check each
 other’s work before handing in assignments. With this exception, I expect that all written work
 submitted to the professor or the TA to be each student’s own work. I tolerate no cheating on
 examinations. Students should read the University rules on scholastic dishonesty, which can be
 found on the Student Judicial Services website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.","M408C: DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS Fall 2012
 Under the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, have you persuaded yourself that
 there are knowledges and truths beyond your grasp, things that you simply cannot learn?
 Have you allowed adverse evidence to pile up and force you to conclude that you are not

 Prerequisites:
 Prerequisite and degree relevance: Either a 560 on the Mathematics IC Test or 560 on
 Mathematics Level IIC, or a grade of at least C in M304E or M305G.
 Note: Students who score less than 600 on the Mathematics Level IC Test should be aware that
 studies show taking M305G first is likely to improve their grade in M408C.
 Only one of the following may be counted: M 403K, 408C, 408K, 308K. 
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 2
 M408C and M408D (or the equivalent sequence M408K, M408L, M408M) are required of
 mathematics majors, and mathematics majors are required to make grades of C or better in these
 courses. Any student who does not have the prerequisites for this course, or who has received
 credit for any of the courses listed above, must see an advisor as soon as possible.
 Students enter Math 408C with a great diversity of mathematics backgrounds. Many have taken
 four years of mathematics plus Advanced Placement Calculus in high school; others may have
 only taken two years of high school algebra and one year of high school geometry. Still others
 will have taken Precalculus (Mathematics 305G) at UT Austin or at a community college. And,
 some will be repeating M408C for a second or third time. Our sections require only that you
 have met the official prerequisites for the course. Our aim is to help every one of you to
 excel and to develop both the desire and the necessary skills to successfully continue your study
 of mathematics and mathematics-dependent subjects. Professor Treisman will arrange extra
 sessions for students who have had no prior exposure to Calculus. These students should make it
 a special priority to attend Prof T’s office hours and his many extra review sessions. Finally,
 students with no prior coursework in Calculus will have extra opportunities to earn points toward
 their final grade.
 Quantitative Reasoning Flag Course:
 This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed
 to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments
 you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a
 substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real- world problems.
 Course Description:
 M408C is the first semester of our standard first-year calculus sequence. It is designed for
 students with interests in the mathematical, natural, and social sciences as well as for prospective
 engineers and architects. This section of M408C is designed to help students develop:
 (1) a conceptual understanding of the major ideas of differential and integral calculus,
 (2) technical facility with its techniques and theorems, and
 (3) the ability to use these techniques and theorems to solve a variety of standard and nonstandard problems.
 The focus of this first calculus course is not on theory. However, because proof is so central to
 later mathematical work, we will take a rigorous approach to the theory of limits and you will
 learn how to prove the basic theorems that underlie important computational techniques.
 Students will also learn to use the main course theorems to prove their important corollaries.
 Calculus is a beautiful and venerable subject that provides powerful tools for analyzing the
 behavior of functions—that is, the ways that changes in certain quantities affect changes in one
 or more other quantities. These tools—developed in the seventeenth century and refined over
 the next quarter of a millennium—represent one of civilization’s greatest intellectual
 achievements. Calculus makes possible a concise and accurate description of the motion of
 heavenly bodies, of basic economic principles, and of countless other phenomena in which
 change and interdependence are central.
 Calculus often allows us to compute the past and future states of a system, and here lies one
 source of its power. It allows us to find desirable states of systems such as when one important
 quantity takes its largest or smallest value, or moves at its greatest velocity, or just plain stops
 changing for a spell. Often, when using the tools of calculus, one discovers that two systems or
 phenomena, which appear at first to be completely unrelated, have exactly the same underlying
 structure so that intuition in one domain allows us to better understand the other. This discovery 
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 3
 of surprising similarities, that by looking through the lens of mathematics one can often see
 unity, is one of the special pleasures of our subject and one of the reasons that drive some to
 choose mathematics as their profession. We hope that, at semester’s end, you will have a sense
 of the power of The Calculus and a growing appreciation for its beauty. Welcome to the
 community of mathematicians.

 Learning Calculus and the Role of the Professor and Teaching Assistant:
 I was unable to find flaws in my 'proof' for quite a while, even though the error is very
 obvious. It was a psychological problem, a blindness, an excitement, an inhibition of
 reasoning by an underlying fear of being wrong. Techniques leading to the abandonment
 of such inhibitions should be cultivated by every honest mathematician.
 —  , one of my math professors at UC Berkeley, in an article on how he
 failed to prove the Poincaré conjecture
 Experience has taught us that mastering the content of M408C requires that students spend
 many, many hours solving calculus problems and studying the textbook. We strongly
 recommend getting to know some of your classmates and spending lots of time with them
 working through hard problems, comparing notes on homework, and studying for examinations.
 You should also make good use of our office hours, of the online Dana Center/Agile Mind
 resources, and of the many other resources available on campus. We estimate that “A” students
 will spend at least 15 hours a week studying for this course in addition to the time spent in
 lecture and section. Of special importance is making sure you do not fall behind. The pace of
 M408C is brisk; it’s hard to catch up. If you feel that your performance is slipping, come and
 see us as soon as possible. If the professor or teaching assistant thinks that your performance is
 slipping, one of us will hunt you down. Our goal is to help you all excel in this course. We need
 your cooperation.
 In lecture, we will not cover everything in the textbook, but rather, will spend most of the time
 exploring difficult points and interesting problems, and working together on exercises that will
 help us help you learn calculus. Do not expect a 75-minute lecture; they will rarely be given. Typically, the content covered in a lecture will be useful to completing a subsequent homework
 assignment. But, occasionally, I will assign homework problems on material not yet covered in
 lecture. This is one among many signals to you that the course syllabus has been specified and
 that you are largely responsible for learning the basic material on your own and in collaboration
 with your peers and teaching assistants. As the course progresses you will be responsible for
 learning more and more of the basic material independently, but fear not—the teaching assistants
 and I will be there to support you whenever you have trouble.
 I expect many of you to be regulars at my office hours—that’s where we get to work on
 problems in depth and where I can be responsive to your individual needs. Besides, as you’ll
 discover, I’m quite witty and charming—and humble too!
 The purpose of discussion sections is not only to respond to your individual questions, but also to
 afford you an opportunity to work with your peers on the kinds of problems that will appear on
 the course examinations. You’ll find your teaching assistant to be an invaluable resource for
 helping you to excel in the course.
 We expect you to come to every lecture and discussion section prepared to do mathematics.
 Your running point total (as described below) will be posted on a secure part of the course
 website. You’ll need to sign in with your UT EID and password to access your scores. No other
 student can access your scores.
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 5
 Grading Scheme:
 Your final grade in M408C will be determined by the number of points you earn on the
 following scale:
 A 1100 or higher
 A– 1025 to 1099
 B+ 975 to 1024
 B 900 to 974
 B– 850 to 899
 C+ 800 to 849
 C 750 to 799
 C– 700 to 749
 D+ 650 to 699
 D 600 to 649
 F below 600
 During the 15 weeks of instruction, points can be earned in many ways:
 up to 100 points on in-lecture spot quizzes,
 up to 200 points on homework,
 up to 100 points on Chapter 2 Quiz,
 up to 250 points on Midterm I,
 up to 250 points on Midterm II,
 up to 100 points for high quality participation and engagement in your discussion section,
 In addition, there are many ways to earn up to as many as 200 extra credit points.
 However, only up to 1,000 points earned during the 15 weeks of instruction will be counted
 toward your final point total. Nota bene: Even if you earn 1,200 points only 1,000 will be
 counted toward your final point total.
 You can earn up to 300 points on the final exam and these will count toward your final point
 total.
 In other words, you cannot earn an A- or A in the course if you do not take the final exam.
 It will be near impossible to earn an A without doing lots of extra credit work.
 Note that you are not competing with your classmates. I’ve designed the grading system—an
 absolute scale—explicitly to promote collaboration in learning calculus.
 Exams will be challenging, but there will be few surprises, and conscientious studying should
 produce A-level work. I gladly give partial credit for work that is partially correct. Midterms
 and the final exam must be written in 8 x 10” bluebooks available at many on- and off-campus
 stores. Be a sport and bring an extra one to exams for those who forget.
 BANKRUPT YOUR PROFESSOR
 How badly do I want you to excel in this course? If all the students in any section earn an A in
 the course, that is, earn 1100 points or more, the students in that section can pick any restaurant
 in Austin for a celebration—and dinner is on me. This has happened three times since I began
 teaching at UT in fall 1991.
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 6
 Class Leadership Team:
 By week three of the course, each section must elect a student section leader. The student
 section leaders will meet with me 4 times throughout the semester to give me advice on
 improving the course. They will survey their fellow students and otherwise engage in activities
 to surface class problems and opportunities. I will provide lunch, snacks of whatever form of
 bribery is necessary to help you help me to make this a great semester.
 Earning Points and Grading Policies
 In-lecture spot quizzes (100 points):
 Thirteen times in lecture I will give a two-minute quiz designed to be very easy for those who
 have prepared for class by reading the assigned material—and designed to be very challenging
 for those who did not do so. Each quiz will be worth up to ten points with partial credit given.
 Most of these one-item quizzes will ask you to state a definition or theorem in the required
 reading or, perhaps, to solve an elementary problem worked out in the assigned section of text.
 The ten highest scores will be added to determine your score in this category. Since there will be
 13 quizzes and only the top ten count, there will be no quiz makeups. Again, no make-ups will
 be offered for this point-earning category. Occasionally, the class assistant will grant you more
 than 10 points for superior work on your quiz, but your maximum total in this grading category
 remains 100 points.
 Homework (up to 100 points for book problems and up to 100 points for Quest problems):
 Learning calculus requires developing computational fluency with important algorithms,
 developing a deep conceptual understanding of a beautiful set of ideas, and learning to apply
 these ideas and algorithms to both classical and novel problems. You can only achieve this
 through lots of practice, made with pencil (and, often, graphing calculator) in hand. One way to
 organize this necessary work is by being diligent at doing homework. There’s lots of it; ain’t no
 way around that. There will be approximately 27 homework assignments, each of which will
 require approximately five hours of work.
 Each homework assignment will consist of the following:
 § 3–6 difficult problems assigned from the textbook. Your work must be submitted on
 8 ½ x 11” paper, stapled in the upper left corner. Be sure to include your name and
 section number on each page. This makes it easier for us to keep track of 130+
 students’ work.
 § Approximately 10–20 additional problems administered through the Quest Learning and
 Assessment System. The Quest website is available at http://quest.cns.utexas.edu.
 Required Notice Regarding Quest: This course makes use of the web-based Quest
 content delivery and homework server system maintained by the College of Natural
 Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin. This homework service will require a $25
 charge per student for its use, which goes toward the maintenance and operation of the
 resource. Please go to http://quest.cns.utexas.edu to log in to the Quest system for this
 class. At some point during the second or third week, when you log into Quest, you will
 be asked to pay via credit card on a secure payment site. You have the option to wait up
 to 15 days to pay while still continuing to use Quest for your assignments. If you are
 taking more than one course using Quest, you will not be charged more than
 $50/semester. Quest provides mandatory instructional material for this course, just as is
 your textbook, etc. For payment questions, email Write neatly!!! Reading homework assignments is painstakingly hard work. Be kind to the
 grader and to your professor, who will occasionally read a sample of homework papers. The
 grader has the authority to give zero points to illegible homework assignments.
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 7
 Nota Bene: On each assignment from the textbook only one problem will be graded. You will
 not know which one it is in advance. Credit is given for the solution to a problem, not for the
 answer, which you will often be able to find in the back of the textbook.
 Each homework assignment on Quest is worth up to 5 points. If you score 100%, then you will
 earn 5 points. If you score 50%, then you will earn 2.5 points, etc..
 Your final homework score is the sum of your 20 highest homework grades from the textbook
 plus your 20 highest homework grades from Quest (maximum of 200 points).
 Chapter 2 Quiz (up to 100 points):
 This quiz will test your knowledge of the material on chapter 2.
 Midterm I: (up to 250 points):
 This midterm will consist of four questions on the material in Topics I and II.
 § Question 1 (4 parts, each worth 20 points, for a total of 80 points) will test your
 computational skills.
 § Question 2 (60 points) will be a modified version of an assigned (challenging)
 homework problem.
 § Question 3 (60 points) will be a modified version of a problem worked out in the
 assigned sections of the text.
 § Question 4 (50 points) A wild card!
 Midterm II: (up to 250 points):
 This midterm will consist of five questions on the material in Topics III, IV, inverse functions,
 and logarithms.
 § Question 1 (4 parts each worth 20 points for a total of 80 points). This question will test
 your computational skills.
 § Question 2 (40 points) will be a modified version of an assigned (challenging)
 homework problem.
 § Question 3 (40 points) will be a modified version of a problem worked out in the
 assigned sections of the text.
 § Question 4 (40 points) will be a modified version of a problem chosen from a list of 15
 hard problems that will be distributed two weeks before the examination.
 § Question 5 (50 points) A wild card!
 Final Examination (up to 300 points):
 The structure of the comprehensive final exam will be discussed in class.
 Exam Make-Up policy:
 Midterm I: If, for documented health reasons, a student misses Midterm I, then a make-up exam
 will be provided at a time convenient to both student and professor.
 Midterm II: If, for documented health reasons, a student misses Midterm II, then a make-up
 exam will be provided at a time convenient to both student and professor.
 Final Exam: If, for documented health reasons, a student misses the Final Exam, the student will
 receive an Incomplete in the course. The grade will be determined after the student completes a
 make-up final at a time convenient to both student and professor.
 Make-up examinations will be taken in Professor Treisman’s Dana Center office at
 1616 Guadalupe, Room 3.206 (UTA bldg) and will be proctored by Professor Treisman’s staff.
 Nota bene: No make-ups for in-class spot quizzes or for homeworks.
 M408C Treisman Fall 2012 8
 Discussion Section (up to 100 points):
 Your discussion section instructor will evaluate the quality of your participation in section. We
 expect you to come prepared to work on problems from the assigned reading, to collaborate with
 your classmates on hard problems, and to seek our help and extra challenges when needed. They
 may choose to give you quizzes or special assignments on which they base the number of points
 you earn in this category. These points, if any, will be awarded at the end of the semester.
 Earning Extra Credit (up to 200 points):
 Agile Mind (up to 100 points of extra credit): Students will be given passwords to this online
 support system for learning calculus developed by Prof Treisman and his colleagues. The
 service consists of more than 25 units on the main course topics together with helpful
 animations, simulations, and problem sets. The service keeps track of your work and allows the
 professor and TA to view your progress as well as the time spent on each task. We will
 demonstrate the service in class and will distribute a sheet describing how to earn extra credit.
 Students can earn up to 4 extra credit points for each online unit completed (up to a maximum of
 100 points), if the unit is completed by the announced deadline. A completed unit represents
 approx. 40–90 minutes of work. More information will be provided when the online system is
 demonstrated in class. Your work will be graded by the course Famulus minor and her decisions
 are final!
 Special Sessions: The UT Sanger Learning Center offers review classes that are often excellent.

DIFFICULT DIALOGUES: LIVING WITH DYING
“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” Mahatma Gandhi
“I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. That is clear. Whether one believes in
religion or not, whether one believes in this religion or that religion, we all are seeking something better
in life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards happiness…” His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama
Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? – Mary Oliver
I. COURSE DESCRIPTION
This interactive seminar will explore how individuals understand living and dying. Critical reflection on
selected readings, art, poetry, photography, theatre, music, and films will cover a range of topics, such as
life meaning, dying, grief, transformation, suffering, love and hope. Students will critically reflect on their
own lives using an interdisciplinary perspective, and relate their experiences to class material.
Note about Course:
Signature Courses are designed to expose entering UT students to the broad goals and possibilities of a
university education, while promoting a greater sense of intellectual community among undergraduates.
Signature Courses are designed to make students aware of the high standards necessary for college-level
academic work and help students cultivate skills to meet those standards. This class is designated as a
First-Year Seminar Signature Course and a Difficult Dialogues Course.
Difficult Dialogues: A Ford Foundation Program (www.difficultdialogues.org)
This course is a “Difficult Dialogues”, designed to promote open scholarly inquiry, academic freedom,
and respect for different cultures and beliefs on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. The
development of the Difficult Dialogues courses was partially funded through a grant from the Ford
Foundation to the University of Texas at Austin. The Difficult Dialogues project is now sponsored by the
Humanities Institute, which has been organizing Public Forums and other programming that can reach the
wider university community. This course is thus part of a larger project to promote respectful dialogue,
innovative teaching, and academic freedom at UT.

V. COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES
Classroom Policies
The primary goal of UT Austin is to prepare you for a beginning professional career. As a result, it is
important that you begin to demonstrate professionalism in every aspect of your attendance, social
interactions and academic performance. The following guidelines should provide you with a general
overview of what is expected.
This is a seminar, writing emphasis course, which means that contributions from each student are needed
to advance the learning process. Students will be expected to come to class prepared to participate in class
learning. Here is a brief summary of how the course will work.
Students are expected to attend class sessions regularly and to participate in an interactive framework
between students and professor. Students are expected to complete the readings prior to class, and should
be well prepared to participate in discussions and experiential learning assignments. Failure to regularly
attend the class and demonstrate through discussions that one has comprehended the readings will be
strongly considered in assigning the final grade. Students are responsible for any material missed due to
absences.
Students are expected to turn in all required assignments on the agreed upon due date at the beginning of
class. Assignments turned in after class starts will be considered late. All late assignments will be
assessed point penalties at the rate of 2 points each day late. If the due date is a problem, then the
student should see the professor and negotiate another due date at least 24 hours PRIOR to the regularly
scheduled due date. Make sure you back up your work. Computer hardware or software problems WILL
NOT be a valid reason for a late assignment.
Class Attendance
One of the goals of the program is to provide students with a curriculum that will adequately prepare them
for beginning professional careers. In order to model this, please treat coming to classes as you would
approach working at a job. Given the requirements for professional behavior, attendance for all classes is
required. More than one unexcused absence, excessive tardiness, or patterns of leaving early may result in
a reduction of the final grade. Students must present a written excuse from a health care provider for
excused absences due to illness or other documentation as requested by the instructor for excused
absences. If a student misses more than 3 classes - whether or not there is a documented, excused absence
– the student may receive a failing grade.
Participation and Professionalism
A crucial component of professional college education relates to an understanding of and adherence to a
set of values and work ethics. Active participation in the classroom setting facilitates clarification and
understanding of these values and ethics, as well as your comprehension of the materials the class covers.
Students must practice professional behavior in class. This includes participating constructively in class.
Students can demonstrate constructive participation in a variety of ways:
1. Physical attendance at classes;
2. Verbal involvement in class and group discussions;
4
3. Active participation in role plays or other group exercises;
4. Initiating discussion or bringing in information from assigned readings, other readings and/or
experiences;
5. One-to-one dialogue with the instructor, inside or outside of class;
6. Written dialogue (email or paper); and
7. Timely submission of assignments.
When considering the quantity and quality of participation, the following issues should be considered:
• An appropriate level of participation from each student is related to the number of students in the class,
the format of the class (lecture, community event, or guest speaker), and the desirability of conciseness;
• Respect the rights of others in the class, including privacy and safety (physical and emotional);
• Good questions can include admitting one’s lack of knowledge about a subject (if one person is feeling
self-conscious about asking a question that may be seen as “stupid”, there are probably several others in
the class who want to know the same thing);
• Students do not need to agree with statements made by the instructor or other students, however, respect
for differences should be shown. Students are encouraged to think for themselves, ask challenging
questions (in a respectful manner), and arrive at their own understandings;
• Questions/comments which are not relevant to the class or which are stated clearly in the materials can
detract from the class and consume valuable time (e.g., before asking, “Is that single-spaced or doublespaced?” and “When is the assignment due?”, please check to see if these types of questions are covered
in the Course Syllabus).
• Students should respect for the dignity and self-worth of all individuals, regardless of ethnicity, culture,
nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, age, gender, disability, political belief, or other aspects of
diversity.
• If a student is away due to illness or other reason, it is that student’s responsibility to obtain notes,
handout material, etc. from another student. The student may also suggest ways that they can make up for
time lost (e.g., if you miss a class and you want to propose an extra assignment, such as a journaling
exercise, to make up for not being able to participate in the class).
Classroom Conduct
a. Arriving on time for class; returning from break in a timely fashion. It is important to demonstrate
to your colleagues that they are important to you. Being prompt for all appointments is one way to
demonstrate this professional behavior. You should therefore be prompt for class.
b. Being prepared for class. As a professional you should be prepared for all appointments and
meetings. You can begin to demonstrate your ability to be prepared by always being prepared for class.
c. Paying attention in class. As a professional you need to be an active listener to appropriately respond.
This skill can be demonstrated by being an active listener in class as well. Please turn off and put away
all electronics before class.
d. Remaining in class until the class is over or until the professor announces a break. As a
professional you are committed to treating your colleagues with respect and courtesy. This can be
demonstrated in class by treating faculty and fellow students with respect and courtesy by remaining in
class while it is in session.
5
e. Handing in assignments in a timely fashion. It is of vital importance to colleagues that you meet
deadlines. This can be demonstrated in class by completing the required readings by the dates listed in the
syllabus and turning in papers and projects by the expected due dates.
f. Demonstrating respect for the opinions of others. Professionals should be tolerant of different points
of view. In the classroom, this can be demonstrated by the manner in which we respect the opinions of
faculty and fellow students.
Office Hours
Please feel free to visit me during my office hours or by appointment in order to discuss anything related
to the class and in order to allow me to get to know you better. You’re welcome to drop by without an
appointment, although I also suggest that you email me in advance to let me know you’re coming so that I
can plan for your visit. I sometimes have to adjust my office hours in order to attend meetings, but you
are always welcome, and the class will go much better if I have a sense of who you are as a student and a
person. My office is located in the School of Social Work building.
Writing Flag
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with
writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester,
complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your
writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one assignment. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core
Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal
Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
The University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these
values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, the student may refer to the Web Site of the
Student Judicial Services, Office of the Dean of Students (http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/). If you
use words or ideas that are not your own you must cite your sources. Otherwise, you will be guilty of
plagiarism.
Documented Disability Statement
Any student who requires special accommodations must obtain a letter that documents the disability from
the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement
(471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). Present the letter to the
professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed accommodations can be discussed. The student
should remind the professor of any testing accommodations no later than five business days before an
exam. For more information, visit http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
Religious Holidays
By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of a pending absence at least fourteen days prior
to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If the student must miss a class, an examination, a work 
6
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, the professor will give the student an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students
Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students are responsible
for reading their email for university and course-related information and announcements. Students are
responsible to keep the university informed about changes to their e-mail address. Students should check
their e-mail regularly and frequently—daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with
university-related communications, some of which may be time-sensitive. Students can find UT Austin’s
policies and instructions for updating their e-mail address at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
Use of Blackboard in Class
In this class the professor uses Blackboard—a Web-based course management system with passwordprotected access at http://courses.utexas.edu—to distribute course materials, to communicate and
collaborate online, to post grades, to submit assignments, and to share other resources. Students can find
support in using Blackboard at the ITS Help Desk by calling 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to
6 p.m. Please plan accordingly.
Writing Center
Students are encouraged to use the Undergraduate Writing Center (located in FAC 211; phone number
471-6222: http://uwc.utexas.edu/home). The Undergraduate Writing Center offers free, individualized,
expert help with writing for any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis. Any
undergraduate student enrolled in a course at UT can visit the UWC for assistance with any writing
project. They work with students from every department on campus, for both academic and non-academic
writing. Whether you are writing a lab report, a resume, a term paper, a statement for an application, or
your own poetry, UWC consultants will be happy to work with you. Their services are not just for writing
with “problems.” Getting feedback from an informed audience is a normal part of a successful writing
project. Consultants help students develop strategies to improve their writing. The assistance they provide
is intended to foster independence. Each student determines how to use the consultant's advice. The
consultants are trained to help you work on your writing in ways that preserve the integrity of your work.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If students are worried about someone who is acting differently, they may use the Behavior Concerns
Advice Line to discuss by phone their concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is
provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental
Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police
Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
VI. COURSE ASSIGNMENTS
1. Students must write three papers -one Loss History Paper (assignment 1a), one Selection Paper
(assignment 1b), and one Meditation Paper (assignment 1c). All papers are due at the beginning of the
classes marked on the schedule. Each paper should be 4 pages in length, typed, double-spaced with 12-
point font and one-inch margins on all sides. You will write a total of 3 papers (one Loss History Paper,
one Selection Paper, and one Meditation Paper), each worth 20 points (for a cumulative worth of 60% of
the final grade). 
7
I’ll be looking for the following as I grade the papers:
• Personal critical reflection (how much critical self-reflection about your own past experiences, future
visions, hopes, dreams, and so on are evident in the paper). Each Selection paper should include
reflecting on at least one passage from the Halifax text.
• Integration of critical thought, experiences, class discussions, and readings blended together (how
well do you demonstrate the ability to integrate critical thought, your experiences, and class material).

• Integration of self with class material (how well do you demonstrate that you have struggled with the
integration of your personal characteristics [e.g., values, ethical dilemmas, personality traits, etc.]
with key concepts covered in class readings and discussions).
• The quality of the writing as well as the content. Written material should be carefully proof-read and
errors (punctuation, typographical, spelling) corrected. Good writing requires a reiterative process
that must be followed if quality is to improve. I strongly encourage you to read your paper several
times and, if possible, have someone else proof read it.
To complete these papers, you will have to state your own views on loss and living. You may talk about
yourself or your experiences. But these papers should not be solely about you and your feelings (they are
not diaries or journals); try to connect your experiences to the larger questions and concepts discussed in
class. In your papers, you will want to draw on evidence or arguments from other sources. If you do use
information from other sources, make sure it is properly cited.
1a. Loss History Paper
Each of us develops our own unique style of coping with grief and loss. The goal of this assignment is
for you to describe your own experiences with loss.
Part I: Create a Loss History Graph
Considering the broad definition of loss discussed in class, construct a loss history graph which represents
the loss events in your life. It can be as simple as this:
Loss at age four death of significant person divorce
______/_______________________/____________________________/_______
dates and any other significant information
If there are losses that you choose not to disclose, that is fine. The main goal is to create a visual of the
losses that you have experienced in your life. If you choose, you may be creative by adding symbols or
graphics or anything you like! Use anything that you think will add meaning to this assessment tool.
This is not required, but is encouraged.
Part II:Describe your personal style of dealing with loss
*How have you coped with these events?
*How have the following influenced your coping style:
-people around you?
-your cultural background, ethnicity, religion?
-your personal values, attitudes, and beliefs
-what parts of loss are easiest for you to talk about? What parts make you uncomfortable?
-where do you get support when you are facing challenges/losses?
8
1b. Selection Papers:
To provide you with flexible choices, you may choose one assignment from the list of possible Selection
Papers listed below.
a. Read the biography of someone who has faced a significant loss. Discuss your impressions about
what this person’s strengths and challenges might have been. How did they cope with the loss
they faced and how did that loss influence them?
b. Interview a relative (grandparent, parent, sibling) about their views on the choices they would
want to make at the end of their lives (e.g. Would you want to be kept alive if a doctor said there
was no chance you would regain consciousness?) Fill out the Five Wishes form for yourself.
http://www.agingwithdignity.org/forms/5wishes.pdf. Reflect upon their choices and yours. What
are the similarities and differences? Why do you think you each have the beliefs that you do?
c. Choose a favorite movie, novel, or artwork (e.g., musical selection, painting) that you feel
illuminates or exemplifies some aspect of loss. Comment on how the writer/filmmaker/artist
portrays his or her perspective; note consistencies or inconsistencies with what we have read or
discussed.
d. Choose a culture different than your own. Do some reading on and research about the cultural
group’s beliefs about death and loss and comment on how those are similar or different from your
own. What did you learn about this cultural group? How was it different than your beliefs?
What surprised you?
e. Read one of the blogs written by a young adult facing illness (listed at the end of the syllabus).
Comment on how the writer is facing their illness, loss issues, fears, hopes, relationships. Reflect
on how that might be similar or different from how you think you might feel. Discuss how the
writer’s experience integrates with the readings from class, discussions, guest speakers.
1c. Meditation on Dying Paper:
Each student will select one meditation from the book, Being with Dying by Joan Halifax and will write a
paper reaction to the meditation. Integrate class discussions/readings and any relevant material to help
you. You will submit a draft of this paper and receive feedback before handing in your final paper. The
draft should be well-developed, complete and demonstrate your ability to integrate course material,
personal reflection and critical thinking into the assignment.
2. Group Presentation
Towards the end the semester, you will begin work on a group presentation. The goal will be to work as a
group on a topic and to lead a discussion. You are welcome to use PowerPoint, film, performance, webbased materials etc. to facilitate the discussion. Each group member will receive the same grade so make
sure that you work together. Groups will consist of 3 people.
Pick an ethical issue in end-of-life care. Research the issues, and discuss any relevant laws or regulations
surrounding the ethical issue. What spiritual or cultural considerations need to be examined? What
values and beliefs do you hold that lead you to take a specific position? (e.g., Should physician-assisted
suicide be legal in all states? How should we decide what care to provide if an individual did not make
his or her wishes known?) Make sure you stay open and respectful of multiple views on the subject. This
is not a time to convince others of your opinion.
Prepare a 5-10 minute ppt presentation highlighting the issue. End with one or two thought provoking
questions and lead the class in a 10-15 minute discussion of the issues. 
9
3. Class Attendance and Participation:
Discussions will have two basic components. Each student will have the opportunity to comment about an
aspect of the readings/movie that is important to him or her. This could mean talking about what part of
the readings/movie most impact or resonate with you. It could mean taking issue with some aspect of the
readings/film. I will assume that everyone has completed the readings and is prepared to respond [we will
be watching film(s) in class]. So, come to class each week prepared to speak coherently about the
readings or watch a film with a critical eye. I will act as discussion leader, and sometimes will provide
informative notes, discussion questions, and lecture material to supplement class readings and discussion.
At the end of the semester I will judge your overall contribution to class discussion. This portion of your
participation grade will be based on your: (a) familiarity with readings; (b) ability to hear and understand
what others say; (c) ability to express yourself clearly; (d) ability to synthesize the thoughts of others to
form new insights, conclusions, or questions; (e) ability to disagree constructively; and (f) cooperation in
building a stimulating and supportive intellectual atmosphere in class; Because a significant portion of
your grade is based on class participation, it is obvious that attendance is crucial; you cannot participate if
you aren’t physically present.
Finally, because this is a Signature Course, attending at least one event of the University Lecture Series
will also be factored into the participation portion of the final grade (see below for details).
University Lecture Series
Designed to create a campus-wide conversation, the University Lecture Series gives first-year students an
opportunity to interact with leading members of our faculty—scholars, scientists, and civic leaders who are
nationally and internationally renowned. All students, faculty, alumni, staff and community guests are
invited, but the events will be aimed at entering first-year students.
Signature Course students are required to attend at least one of the lectures (or watch online).
University Lecture Series,
The School of Undergraduate Studies will assemble a list of lectures that you may count for the spring 2013
Signature Course University Lecture Series requirement. Please note that UGS does not sponsor its own
lectures in the spring. For additional event details, see http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/uls. Bring your UT ID, as
they have required this in years past for admittance.

 DIFFICULT DIALOGUES: LIVING WITH DYING
 “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” Mahatma Gandhi
 “I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. That is clear. Whether one believes in
 religion or not, whether one believes in this religion or that religion, we all are seeking something better
 in life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards happiness…” His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama
 Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? – Mary Oliver
 I. COURSE DESCRIPTION
 This interactive seminar will explore how individuals understand living and dying. Critical reflection on
 selected readings, art, poetry, photography, theatre, music, and films will cover a range of topics, such as
 life meaning, dying, grief, transformation, suffering, love and hope. Students will critically reflect on their
 own lives using an interdisciplinary perspective, and relate their experiences to class material.
 Note about Course:
 Signature Courses are designed to expose entering UT students to the broad goals and possibilities of a
 university education, while promoting a greater sense of intellectual community among undergraduates.
 Signature Courses are designed to make students aware of the high standards necessary for college-level
 academic work and help students cultivate skills to meet those standards. This class is designated as a
 First-Year Seminar Signature Course and a Difficult Dialogues Course.
 Difficult Dialogues: A Ford Foundation Program (www.difficultdialogues.org)
 This course is a “Difficult Dialogues”, designed to promote open scholarly inquiry, academic freedom,
 and respect for different cultures and beliefs on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. The
 development of the Difficult Dialogues courses was partially funded through a grant from the Ford
 Foundation to the University of Texas at Austin. The Difficult Dialogues project is now sponsored by the
 Humanities Institute, which has been organizing Public Forums and other programming that can reach the
 wider university community. This course is thus part of a larger project to promote respectful dialogue,
 innovative teaching, and academic freedom at UT.

 V. COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES
 Classroom Policies
 The primary goal of UT Austin is to prepare you for a beginning professional career. As a result, it is
 important that you begin to demonstrate professionalism in every aspect of your attendance, social
 interactions and academic performance. The following guidelines should provide you with a general
 overview of what is expected.
 This is a seminar, writing emphasis course, which means that contributions from each student are needed
 to advance the learning process. Students will be expected to come to class prepared to participate in class
 learning. Here is a brief summary of how the course will work.
 Students are expected to attend class sessions regularly and to participate in an interactive framework
 between students and professor. Students are expected to complete the readings prior to class, and should
 be well prepared to participate in discussions and experiential learning assignments. Failure to regularly
 attend the class and demonstrate through discussions that one has comprehended the readings will be
 strongly considered in assigning the final grade. Students are responsible for any material missed due to
 absences.
 Students are expected to turn in all required assignments on the agreed upon due date at the beginning of
 class. Assignments turned in after class starts will be considered late. All late assignments will be
 assessed point penalties at the rate of 2 points each day late. If the due date is a problem, then the
 student should see the professor and negotiate another due date at least 24 hours PRIOR to the regularly
 scheduled due date. Make sure you back up your work. Computer hardware or software problems WILL
 NOT be a valid reason for a late assignment.
 Class Attendance
 One of the goals of the program is to provide students with a curriculum that will adequately prepare them
 for beginning professional careers. In order to model this, please treat coming to classes as you would
 approach working at a job. Given the requirements for professional behavior, attendance for all classes is
 required. More than one unexcused absence, excessive tardiness, or patterns of leaving early may result in
 a reduction of the final grade. Students must present a written excuse from a health care provider for
 excused absences due to illness or other documentation as requested by the instructor for excused
 absences. If a student misses more than 3 classes - whether or not there is a documented, excused absence
 – the student may receive a failing grade.
 Participation and Professionalism
 A crucial component of professional college education relates to an understanding of and adherence to a
 set of values and work ethics. Active participation in the classroom setting facilitates clarification and
 understanding of these values and ethics, as well as your comprehension of the materials the class covers.
 Students must practice professional behavior in class. This includes participating constructively in class.
 Students can demonstrate constructive participation in a variety of ways:
 1. Physical attendance at classes;
 2. Verbal involvement in class and group discussions;
 4
 3. Active participation in role plays or other group exercises;
 4. Initiating discussion or bringing in information from assigned readings, other readings and/or
 experiences;
 5. One-to-one dialogue with the instructor, inside or outside of class;
 6. Written dialogue (email or paper); and
 7. Timely submission of assignments.
 When considering the quantity and quality of participation, the following issues should be considered:
 • An appropriate level of participation from each student is related to the number of students in the class,
 the format of the class (lecture, community event, or guest speaker), and the desirability of conciseness;
 • Respect the rights of others in the class, including privacy and safety (physical and emotional);
 • Good questions can include admitting one’s lack of knowledge about a subject (if one person is feeling
 self-conscious about asking a question that may be seen as “stupid”, there are probably several others in
 the class who want to know the same thing);
 • Students do not need to agree with statements made by the instructor or other students, however, respect
 for differences should be shown. Students are encouraged to think for themselves, ask challenging
 questions (in a respectful manner), and arrive at their own understandings;
 • Questions/comments which are not relevant to the class or which are stated clearly in the materials can
 detract from the class and consume valuable time (e.g., before asking, “Is that single-spaced or doublespaced?” and “When is the assignment due?”, please check to see if these types of questions are covered
 in the Course Syllabus).
 • Students should respect for the dignity and self-worth of all individuals, regardless of ethnicity, culture,
 nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, age, gender, disability, political belief, or other aspects of
 diversity.
 • If a student is away due to illness or other reason, it is that student’s responsibility to obtain notes,
 handout material, etc. from another student. The student may also suggest ways that they can make up for
 time lost (e.g., if you miss a class and you want to propose an extra assignment, such as a journaling
 exercise, to make up for not being able to participate in the class).
 Classroom Conduct
 a. Arriving on time for class; returning from break in a timely fashion. It is important to demonstrate
 to your colleagues that they are important to you. Being prompt for all appointments is one way to
 demonstrate this professional behavior. You should therefore be prompt for class.
 b. Being prepared for class. As a professional you should be prepared for all appointments and
 meetings. You can begin to demonstrate your ability to be prepared by always being prepared for class.
 c. Paying attention in class. As a professional you need to be an active listener to appropriately respond.
 This skill can be demonstrated by being an active listener in class as well. Please turn off and put away
 all electronics before class.
 d. Remaining in class until the class is over or until the professor announces a break. As a
 professional you are committed to treating your colleagues with respect and courtesy. This can be
 demonstrated in class by treating faculty and fellow students with respect and courtesy by remaining in
 class while it is in session.
 5
 e. Handing in assignments in a timely fashion. It is of vital importance to colleagues that you meet
 deadlines. This can be demonstrated in class by completing the required readings by the dates listed in the
 syllabus and turning in papers and projects by the expected due dates.
 f. Demonstrating respect for the opinions of others. Professionals should be tolerant of different points
 of view. In the classroom, this can be demonstrated by the manner in which we respect the opinions of
 faculty and fellow students.
 Office Hours
 Please feel free to visit me during my office hours or by appointment in order to discuss anything related
 to the class and in order to allow me to get to know you better. You’re welcome to drop by without an
 appointment, although I also suggest that you email me in advance to let me know you’re coming so that I
 can plan for your visit. I sometimes have to adjust my office hours in order to attend meetings, but you
 are always welcome, and the class will go much better if I have a sense of who you are as a student and a
 person. My office is located in the School of Social Work building.
 Writing Flag
 This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with
 writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester,
 complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your
 writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one assignment. You should therefore expect a
 substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core
 Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal
 Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
 The University of Texas Honor Code
 The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
 individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these
 values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
 Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
 Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
 including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
 dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic
 dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, the student may refer to the Web Site of the
 Student Judicial Services, Office of the Dean of Students (http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/). If you
 use words or ideas that are not your own you must cite your sources. Otherwise, you will be guilty of
 plagiarism.
 Documented Disability Statement
 Any student who requires special accommodations must obtain a letter that documents the disability from
 the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement
 (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). Present the letter to the
 professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed accommodations can be discussed. The student
 should remind the professor of any testing accommodations no later than five business days before an
 exam. For more information, visit http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
 Religious Holidays
 By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of a pending absence at least fourteen days prior
 to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If the student must miss a class, an examination, a work 
 6
 assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, the professor will give the student an
 opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
 Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students
 Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students are responsible
 for reading their email for university and course-related information and announcements. Students are
 responsible to keep the university informed about changes to their e-mail address. Students should check
 their e-mail regularly and frequently—daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with
 university-related communications, some of which may be time-sensitive. Students can find UT Austin’s
 policies and instructions for updating their e-mail address at
 http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
 Use of Blackboard in Class
 In this class the professor uses Blackboard—a Web-based course management system with passwordprotected access at http://courses.utexas.edu—to distribute course materials, to communicate and
 collaborate online, to post grades, to submit assignments, and to share other resources. Students can find
 support in using Blackboard at the ITS Help Desk by calling 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to
 6 p.m. Please plan accordingly.
 Writing Center
 Students are encouraged to use the Undergraduate Writing Center (located in FAC 211; phone number
 471-6222: http://uwc.utexas.edu/home). The Undergraduate Writing Center offers free, individualized,
 expert help with writing for any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis. Any
 undergraduate student enrolled in a course at UT can visit the UWC for assistance with any writing
 project. They work with students from every department on campus, for both academic and non-academic
 writing. Whether you are writing a lab report, a resume, a term paper, a statement for an application, or
 your own poetry, UWC consultants will be happy to work with you. Their services are not just for writing
 with “problems.” Getting feedback from an informed audience is a normal part of a successful writing
 project. Consultants help students develop strategies to improve their writing. The assistance they provide
 is intended to foster independence. Each student determines how to use the consultant's advice. The
 consultants are trained to help you work on your writing in ways that preserve the integrity of your work.
 Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
 If students are worried about someone who is acting differently, they may use the Behavior Concerns
 Advice Line to discuss by phone their concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is
 provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental
 Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police
 Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
 VI. COURSE ASSIGNMENTS
 1. Students must write three papers -one Loss History Paper (assignment 1a), one Selection Paper
 (assignment 1b), and one Meditation Paper (assignment 1c). All papers are due at the beginning of the
 classes marked on the schedule. Each paper should be 4 pages in length, typed, double-spaced with 12-
 point font and one-inch margins on all sides. You will write a total of 3 papers (one Loss History Paper,
 one Selection Paper, and one Meditation Paper), each worth 20 points (for a cumulative worth of 60% of
 the final grade). 
 7
 I’ll be looking for the following as I grade the papers:
 • Personal critical reflection (how much critical self-reflection about your own past experiences, future
 visions, hopes, dreams, and so on are evident in the paper). Each Selection paper should include
 reflecting on at least one passage from the Halifax text.
 • Integration of critical thought, experiences, class discussions, and readings blended together (how
 well do you demonstrate the ability to integrate critical thought, your experiences, and class material).
 
 • Integration of self with class material (how well do you demonstrate that you have struggled with the
 integration of your personal characteristics [e.g., values, ethical dilemmas, personality traits, etc.]
 with key concepts covered in class readings and discussions).
 • The quality of the writing as well as the content. Written material should be carefully proof-read and
 errors (punctuation, typographical, spelling) corrected. Good writing requires a reiterative process
 that must be followed if quality is to improve. I strongly encourage you to read your paper several
 times and, if possible, have someone else proof read it.
 To complete these papers, you will have to state your own views on loss and living. You may talk about
 yourself or your experiences. But these papers should not be solely about you and your feelings (they are
 not diaries or journals); try to connect your experiences to the larger questions and concepts discussed in
 class. In your papers, you will want to draw on evidence or arguments from other sources. If you do use
 information from other sources, make sure it is properly cited.
 1a. Loss History Paper
 Each of us develops our own unique style of coping with grief and loss. The goal of this assignment is
 for you to describe your own experiences with loss.
 Part I: Create a Loss History Graph
 Considering the broad definition of loss discussed in class, construct a loss history graph which represents
 the loss events in your life. It can be as simple as this:
 Loss at age four death of significant person divorce
 ______/_______________________/____________________________/_______
 dates and any other significant information
 If there are losses that you choose not to disclose, that is fine. The main goal is to create a visual of the
 losses that you have experienced in your life. If you choose, you may be creative by adding symbols or
 graphics or anything you like! Use anything that you think will add meaning to this assessment tool.
 This is not required, but is encouraged.
 Part II:Describe your personal style of dealing with loss
 *How have you coped with these events?
 *How have the following influenced your coping style:
 -people around you?
 -your cultural background, ethnicity, religion?
 -your personal values, attitudes, and beliefs
 -what parts of loss are easiest for you to talk about? What parts make you uncomfortable?
 -where do you get support when you are facing challenges/losses?
 8
 1b. Selection Papers:
 To provide you with flexible choices, you may choose one assignment from the list of possible Selection
 Papers listed below.
 a. Read the biography of someone who has faced a significant loss. Discuss your impressions about
 what this person’s strengths and challenges might have been. How did they cope with the loss
 they faced and how did that loss influence them?
 b. Interview a relative (grandparent, parent, sibling) about their views on the choices they would
 want to make at the end of their lives (e.g. Would you want to be kept alive if a doctor said there
 was no chance you would regain consciousness?) Fill out the Five Wishes form for yourself.
 http://www.agingwithdignity.org/forms/5wishes.pdf. Reflect upon their choices and yours. What
 are the similarities and differences? Why do you think you each have the beliefs that you do?
 c. Choose a favorite movie, novel, or artwork (e.g., musical selection, painting) that you feel
 illuminates or exemplifies some aspect of loss. Comment on how the writer/filmmaker/artist
 portrays his or her perspective; note consistencies or inconsistencies with what we have read or
 discussed.
 d. Choose a culture different than your own. Do some reading on and research about the cultural
 group’s beliefs about death and loss and comment on how those are similar or different from your
 own. What did you learn about this cultural group? How was it different than your beliefs?
 What surprised you?
 e. Read one of the blogs written by a young adult facing illness (listed at the end of the syllabus).
 Comment on how the writer is facing their illness, loss issues, fears, hopes, relationships. Reflect
 on how that might be similar or different from how you think you might feel. Discuss how the
 writer’s experience integrates with the readings from class, discussions, guest speakers.
 1c. Meditation on Dying Paper:
 Each student will select one meditation from the book, Being with Dying by Joan Halifax and will write a
 paper reaction to the meditation. Integrate class discussions/readings and any relevant material to help
 you. You will submit a draft of this paper and receive feedback before handing in your final paper. The
 draft should be well-developed, complete and demonstrate your ability to integrate course material,
 personal reflection and critical thinking into the assignment.
 2. Group Presentation
 Towards the end the semester, you will begin work on a group presentation. The goal will be to work as a
 group on a topic and to lead a discussion. You are welcome to use PowerPoint, film, performance, webbased materials etc. to facilitate the discussion. Each group member will receive the same grade so make
 sure that you work together. Groups will consist of 3 people.
 Pick an ethical issue in end-of-life care. Research the issues, and discuss any relevant laws or regulations
 surrounding the ethical issue. What spiritual or cultural considerations need to be examined? What
 values and beliefs do you hold that lead you to take a specific position? (e.g., Should physician-assisted
 suicide be legal in all states? How should we decide what care to provide if an individual did not make
 his or her wishes known?) Make sure you stay open and respectful of multiple views on the subject. This
 is not a time to convince others of your opinion.
 Prepare a 5-10 minute ppt presentation highlighting the issue. End with one or two thought provoking
 questions and lead the class in a 10-15 minute discussion of the issues. 
 9
 3. Class Attendance and Participation:
 Discussions will have two basic components. Each student will have the opportunity to comment about an
 aspect of the readings/movie that is important to him or her. This could mean talking about what part of
 the readings/movie most impact or resonate with you. It could mean taking issue with some aspect of the
 readings/film. I will assume that everyone has completed the readings and is prepared to respond [we will
 be watching film(s) in class]. So, come to class each week prepared to speak coherently about the
 readings or watch a film with a critical eye. I will act as discussion leader, and sometimes will provide
 informative notes, discussion questions, and lecture material to supplement class readings and discussion.
 At the end of the semester I will judge your overall contribution to class discussion. This portion of your
 participation grade will be based on your: (a) familiarity with readings; (b) ability to hear and understand
 what others say; (c) ability to express yourself clearly; (d) ability to synthesize the thoughts of others to
 form new insights, conclusions, or questions; (e) ability to disagree constructively; and (f) cooperation in
 building a stimulating and supportive intellectual atmosphere in class; Because a significant portion of
 your grade is based on class participation, it is obvious that attendance is crucial; you cannot participate if
 you aren’t physically present.
 Finally, because this is a Signature Course, attending at least one event of the University Lecture Series
 will also be factored into the participation portion of the final grade (see below for details).
 University Lecture Series
 Designed to create a campus-wide conversation, the University Lecture Series gives first-year students an
 opportunity to interact with leading members of our faculty—scholars, scientists, and civic leaders who are
 nationally and internationally renowned. All students, faculty, alumni, staff and community guests are
 invited, but the events will be aimed at entering first-year students.
 Signature Course students are required to attend at least one of the lectures (or watch online).
 University Lecture Series,
 The School of Undergraduate Studies will assemble a list of lectures that you may count for the spring 2013
 Signature Course University Lecture Series requirement. Please note that UGS does not sponsor its own
 lectures in the spring. For additional event details, see http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/uls. Bring your UT ID, as
 they have required this in years past for admittance.

 DIFFICULT DIALOGUES: LIVING WITH DYING
 “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” Mahatma Gandhi
 “I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. That is clear. Whether one believes in
 religion or not, whether one believes in this religion or that religion, we all are seeking something better
 in life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards happiness…” His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama
 Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? – Mary Oliver
 I. COURSE DESCRIPTION
 This interactive seminar will explore how individuals understand living and dying. Critical reflection on
 selected readings, art, poetry, photography, theatre, music, and films will cover a range of topics, such as
 life meaning, dying, grief, transformation, suffering, love and hope. Students will critically reflect on their
 own lives using an interdisciplinary perspective, and relate their experiences to class material.
 Note about Course:
 Signature Courses are designed to expose entering UT students to the broad goals and possibilities of a
 university education, while promoting a greater sense of intellectual community among undergraduates.
 Signature Courses are designed to make students aware of the high standards necessary for college-level
 academic work and help students cultivate skills to meet those standards. This class is designated as a
 First-Year Seminar Signature Course and a Difficult Dialogues Course.
 Difficult Dialogues: A Ford Foundation Program (www.difficultdialogues.org)
 This course is a “Difficult Dialogues”, designed to promote open scholarly inquiry, academic freedom,
 and respect for different cultures and beliefs on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. The
 development of the Difficult Dialogues courses was partially funded through a grant from the Ford
 Foundation to the University of Texas at Austin. The Difficult Dialogues project is now sponsored by the
 Humanities Institute, which has been organizing Public Forums and other programming that can reach the
 wider university community. This course is thus part of a larger project to promote respectful dialogue,
 innovative teaching, and academic freedom at UT.

 dialogue and discussions, and audiovisual media to help students understand and integrate their own
 beliefs of living and dying into the course material.
 V. COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES
 Classroom Policies
 The primary goal of UT Austin is to prepare you for a beginning professional career. As a result, it is
 important that you begin to demonstrate professionalism in every aspect of your attendance, social
 interactions and academic performance. The following guidelines should provide you with a general
 overview of what is expected.
 This is a seminar, writing emphasis course, which means that contributions from each student are needed
 to advance the learning process. Students will be expected to come to class prepared to participate in class
 learning. Here is a brief summary of how the course will work.
 Students are expected to attend class sessions regularly and to participate in an interactive framework
 between students and professor. Students are expected to complete the readings prior to class, and should
 be well prepared to participate in discussions and experiential learning assignments. Failure to regularly
 attend the class and demonstrate through discussions that one has comprehended the readings will be
 strongly considered in assigning the final grade. Students are responsible for any material missed due to
 absences.
 Students are expected to turn in all required assignments on the agreed upon due date at the beginning of
 class. Assignments turned in after class starts will be considered late. All late assignments will be
 assessed point penalties at the rate of 2 points each day late. If the due date is a problem, then the
 student should see the professor and negotiate another due date at least 24 hours PRIOR to the regularly
 scheduled due date. Make sure you back up your work. Computer hardware or software problems WILL
 NOT be a valid reason for a late assignment.
 Class Attendance
 One of the goals of the program is to provide students with a curriculum that will adequately prepare them
 for beginning professional careers. In order to model this, please treat coming to classes as you would
 approach working at a job. Given the requirements for professional behavior, attendance for all classes is
 required. More than one unexcused absence, excessive tardiness, or patterns of leaving early may result in
 a reduction of the final grade. Students must present a written excuse from a health care provider for
 excused absences due to illness or other documentation as requested by the instructor for excused
 absences. If a student misses more than 3 classes - whether or not there is a documented, excused absence
 – the student may receive a failing grade.
 Participation and Professionalism
 A crucial component of professional college education relates to an understanding of and adherence to a
 set of values and work ethics. Active participation in the classroom setting facilitates clarification and
 understanding of these values and ethics, as well as your comprehension of the materials the class covers.
 Students must practice professional behavior in class. This includes participating constructively in class.
 Students can demonstrate constructive participation in a variety of ways:
 1. Physical attendance at classes;
 2. Verbal involvement in class and group discussions;
 4
 3. Active participation in role plays or other group exercises;
 4. Initiating discussion or bringing in information from assigned readings, other readings and/or
 experiences;
 5. One-to-one dialogue with the instructor, inside or outside of class;
 6. Written dialogue (email or paper); and
 7. Timely submission of assignments.
 When considering the quantity and quality of participation, the following issues should be considered:
 • An appropriate level of participation from each student is related to the number of students in the class,
 the format of the class (lecture, community event, or guest speaker), and the desirability of conciseness;
 • Respect the rights of others in the class, including privacy and safety (physical and emotional);
 • Good questions can include admitting one’s lack of knowledge about a subject (if one person is feeling
 self-conscious about asking a question that may be seen as “stupid”, there are probably several others in
 the class who want to know the same thing);
 • Students do not need to agree with statements made by the instructor or other students, however, respect
 for differences should be shown. Students are encouraged to think for themselves, ask challenging
 questions (in a respectful manner), and arrive at their own understandings;
 • Questions/comments which are not relevant to the class or which are stated clearly in the materials can
 detract from the class and consume valuable time (e.g., before asking, “Is that single-spaced or doublespaced?” and “When is the assignment due?”, please check to see if these types of questions are covered
 in the Course Syllabus).
 • Students should respect for the dignity and self-worth of all individuals, regardless of ethnicity, culture,
 nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, age, gender, disability, political belief, or other aspects of
 diversity.
 • If a student is away due to illness or other reason, it is that student’s responsibility to obtain notes,
 handout material, etc. from another student. The student may also suggest ways that they can make up for
 time lost (e.g., if you miss a class and you want to propose an extra assignment, such as a journaling
 exercise, to make up for not being able to participate in the class).
 Classroom Conduct
 a. Arriving on time for class; returning from break in a timely fashion. It is important to demonstrate
 to your colleagues that they are important to you. Being prompt for all appointments is one way to
 demonstrate this professional behavior. You should therefore be prompt for class.
 b. Being prepared for class. As a professional you should be prepared for all appointments and
 meetings. You can begin to demonstrate your ability to be prepared by always being prepared for class.
 c. Paying attention in class. As a professional you need to be an active listener to appropriately respond.
 This skill can be demonstrated by being an active listener in class as well. Please turn off and put away
 all electronics before class.
 d. Remaining in class until the class is over or until the professor announces a break. As a
 professional you are committed to treating your colleagues with respect and courtesy. This can be
 demonstrated in class by treating faculty and fellow students with respect and courtesy by remaining in
 class while it is in session.
 5
 e. Handing in assignments in a timely fashion. It is of vital importance to colleagues that you meet
 deadlines. This can be demonstrated in class by completing the required readings by the dates listed in the
 syllabus and turning in papers and projects by the expected due dates.
 f. Demonstrating respect for the opinions of others. Professionals should be tolerant of different points
 of view. In the classroom, this can be demonstrated by the manner in which we respect the opinions of
 faculty and fellow students.
 Office Hours
 Please feel free to visit me during my office hours or by appointment in order to discuss anything related
 to the class and in order to allow me to get to know you better. You’re welcome to drop by without an
 appointment, although I also suggest that you email me in advance to let me know you’re coming so that I
 can plan for your visit. I sometimes have to adjust my office hours in order to attend meetings, but you
 are always welcome, and the class will go much better if I have a sense of who you are as a student and a
 person. My office is located in the School of Social Work building.
 Writing Flag
 This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with
 writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester,
 complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your
 writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one assignment. You should therefore expect a
 substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core
 Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal
 Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
 The University of Texas Honor Code
 The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
 individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these
 values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
 Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
 Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
 including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
 dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic
 dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, the student may refer to the Web Site of the
 Student Judicial Services, Office of the Dean of Students (http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/). If you
 use words or ideas that are not your own you must cite your sources. Otherwise, you will be guilty of
 plagiarism.
 Documented Disability Statement
 Any student who requires special accommodations must obtain a letter that documents the disability from
 the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement
 (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). Present the letter to the
 professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed accommodations can be discussed. The student
 should remind the professor of any testing accommodations no later than five business days before an
 exam. For more information, visit http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
 Religious Holidays
 By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of a pending absence at least fourteen days prior
 to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If the student must miss a class, an examination, a work 
 6
 assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, the professor will give the student an
 opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
 Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students
 Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students are responsible
 for reading their email for university and course-related information and announcements. Students are
 responsible to keep the university informed about changes to their e-mail address. Students should check
 their e-mail regularly and frequently—daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with
 university-related communications, some of which may be time-sensitive. Students can find UT Austin’s
 policies and instructions for updating their e-mail address at
 http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
 Use of Blackboard in Class
 In this class the professor uses Blackboard—a Web-based course management system with passwordprotected access at http://courses.utexas.edu—to distribute course materials, to communicate and
 collaborate online, to post grades, to submit assignments, and to share other resources. Students can find
 support in using Blackboard at the ITS Help Desk by calling 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to
 6 p.m. Please plan accordingly.
 Writing Center
 Students are encouraged to use the Undergraduate Writing Center (located in FAC 211; phone number
 471-6222: http://uwc.utexas.edu/home). The Undergraduate Writing Center offers free, individualized,
 expert help with writing for any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis. Any
 undergraduate student enrolled in a course at UT can visit the UWC for assistance with any writing
 project. They work with students from every department on campus, for both academic and non-academic
 writing. Whether you are writing a lab report, a resume, a term paper, a statement for an application, or
 your own poetry, UWC consultants will be happy to work with you. Their services are not just for writing
 with “problems.” Getting feedback from an informed audience is a normal part of a successful writing
 project. Consultants help students develop strategies to improve their writing. The assistance they provide
 is intended to foster independence. Each student determines how to use the consultant's advice. The
 consultants are trained to help you work on your writing in ways that preserve the integrity of your work.
 Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
 If students are worried about someone who is acting differently, they may use the Behavior Concerns
 Advice Line to discuss by phone their concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is
 provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental
 Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police
 Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
 VI. COURSE ASSIGNMENTS
 1. Students must write three papers -one Loss History Paper (assignment 1a), one Selection Paper
 (assignment 1b), and one Meditation Paper (assignment 1c). All papers are due at the beginning of the
 classes marked on the schedule. Each paper should be 4 pages in length, typed, double-spaced with 12-
 point font and one-inch margins on all sides. You will write a total of 3 papers (one Loss History Paper,
 one Selection Paper, and one Meditation Paper), each worth 20 points (for a cumulative worth of 60% of
 the final grade). 
 7
 I’ll be looking for the following as I grade the papers:
 • Personal critical reflection (how much critical self-reflection about your own past experiences, future
 visions, hopes, dreams, and so on are evident in the paper). Each Selection paper should include
 reflecting on at least one passage from the Halifax text.
 • Integration of critical thought, experiences, class discussions, and readings blended together (how
 well do you demonstrate the ability to integrate critical thought, your experiences, and class material).
 
 • Integration of self with class material (how well do you demonstrate that you have struggled with the
 integration of your personal characteristics [e.g., values, ethical dilemmas, personality traits, etc.]
 with key concepts covered in class readings and discussions).
 • The quality of the writing as well as the content. Written material should be carefully proof-read and
 errors (punctuation, typographical, spelling) corrected. Good writing requires a reiterative process
 that must be followed if quality is to improve. I strongly encourage you to read your paper several
 times and, if possible, have someone else proof read it.
 To complete these papers, you will have to state your own views on loss and living. You may talk about
 yourself or your experiences. But these papers should not be solely about you and your feelings (they are
 not diaries or journals); try to connect your experiences to the larger questions and concepts discussed in
 class. In your papers, you will want to draw on evidence or arguments from other sources. If you do use
 information from other sources, make sure it is properly cited.
 1a. Loss History Paper
 Each of us develops our own unique style of coping with grief and loss. The goal of this assignment is
 for you to describe your own experiences with loss.
 Part I: Create a Loss History Graph
 Considering the broad definition of loss discussed in class, construct a loss history graph which represents
 the loss events in your life. It can be as simple as this:
 Loss at age four death of significant person divorce
 ______/_______________________/____________________________/_______
 dates and any other significant information
 If there are losses that you choose not to disclose, that is fine. The main goal is to create a visual of the
 losses that you have experienced in your life. If you choose, you may be creative by adding symbols or
 graphics or anything you like! Use anything that you think will add meaning to this assessment tool.
 This is not required, but is encouraged.
 Part II:Describe your personal style of dealing with loss
 *How have you coped with these events?
 *How have the following influenced your coping style:
 -people around you?
 -your cultural background, ethnicity, religion?
 -your personal values, attitudes, and beliefs
 -what parts of loss are easiest for you to talk about? What parts make you uncomfortable?
 -where do you get support when you are facing challenges/losses?
 8
 1b. Selection Papers:
 To provide you with flexible choices, you may choose one assignment from the list of possible Selection
 Papers listed below.
 a. Read the biography of someone who has faced a significant loss. Discuss your impressions about
 what this person’s strengths and challenges might have been. How did they cope with the loss
 they faced and how did that loss influence them?
 b. Interview a relative (grandparent, parent, sibling) about their views on the choices they would
 want to make at the end of their lives (e.g. Would you want to be kept alive if a doctor said there
 was no chance you would regain consciousness?) Fill out the Five Wishes form for yourself.
 http://www.agingwithdignity.org/forms/5wishes.pdf. Reflect upon their choices and yours. What
 are the similarities and differences? Why do you think you each have the beliefs that you do?
 c. Choose a favorite movie, novel, or artwork (e.g., musical selection, painting) that you feel
 illuminates or exemplifies some aspect of loss. Comment on how the writer/filmmaker/artist
 portrays his or her perspective; note consistencies or inconsistencies with what we have read or
 discussed.
 d. Choose a culture different than your own. Do some reading on and research about the cultural
 group’s beliefs about death and loss and comment on how those are similar or different from your
 own. What did you learn about this cultural group? How was it different than your beliefs?
 What surprised you?
 e. Read one of the blogs written by a young adult facing illness (listed at the end of the syllabus).
 Comment on how the writer is facing their illness, loss issues, fears, hopes, relationships. Reflect
 on how that might be similar or different from how you think you might feel. Discuss how the
 writer’s experience integrates with the readings from class, discussions, guest speakers.
 1c. Meditation on Dying Paper:
 Each student will select one meditation from the book, Being with Dying by Joan Halifax and will write a
 paper reaction to the meditation. Integrate class discussions/readings and any relevant material to help
 you. You will submit a draft of this paper and receive feedback before handing in your final paper. The
 draft should be well-developed, complete and demonstrate your ability to integrate course material,
 personal reflection and critical thinking into the assignment.
 2. Group Presentation
 Towards the end the semester, you will begin work on a group presentation. The goal will be to work as a
 group on a topic and to lead a discussion. You are welcome to use PowerPoint, film, performance, webbased materials etc. to facilitate the discussion. Each group member will receive the same grade so make
 sure that you work together. Groups will consist of 3 people.
 Pick an ethical issue in end-of-life care. Research the issues, and discuss any relevant laws or regulations
 surrounding the ethical issue. What spiritual or cultural considerations need to be examined? What
 values and beliefs do you hold that lead you to take a specific position? (e.g., Should physician-assisted
 suicide be legal in all states? How should we decide what care to provide if an individual did not make
 his or her wishes known?) Make sure you stay open and respectful of multiple views on the subject. This
 is not a time to convince others of your opinion.
 Prepare a 5-10 minute ppt presentation highlighting the issue. End with one or two thought provoking
 questions and lead the class in a 10-15 minute discussion of the issues. 
 9
 3. Class Attendance and Participation:
 Discussions will have two basic components. Each student will have the opportunity to comment about an
 aspect of the readings/movie that is important to him or her. This could mean talking about what part of
 the readings/movie most impact or resonate with you. It could mean taking issue with some aspect of the
 readings/film. I will assume that everyone has completed the readings and is prepared to respond [we will
 be watching film(s) in class]. So, come to class each week prepared to speak coherently about the
 readings or watch a film with a critical eye. I will act as discussion leader, and sometimes will provide
 informative notes, discussion questions, and lecture material to supplement class readings and discussion.
 At the end of the semester I will judge your overall contribution to class discussion. This portion of your
 participation grade will be based on your: (a) familiarity with readings; (b) ability to hear and understand
 what others say; (c) ability to express yourself clearly; (d) ability to synthesize the thoughts of others to
 form new insights, conclusions, or questions; (e) ability to disagree constructively; and (f) cooperation in
 building a stimulating and supportive intellectual atmosphere in class; Because a significant portion of
 your grade is based on class participation, it is obvious that attendance is crucial; you cannot participate if
 you aren’t physically present.
 Finally, because this is a Signature Course, attending at least one event of the University Lecture Series
 will also be factored into the participation portion of the final grade (see below for details).
 University Lecture Series
 Designed to create a campus-wide conversation, the University Lecture Series gives first-year students an
 opportunity to interact with leading members of our faculty—scholars, scientists, and civic leaders who are
 nationally and internationally renowned. All students, faculty, alumni, staff and community guests are
 invited, but the events will be aimed at entering first-year students.
 Signature Course students are required to attend at least one of the lectures (or watch online).
 University Lecture Series,
 The School of Undergraduate Studies will assemble a list of lectures that you may count for the spring 2013
 Signature Course University Lecture Series requirement. Please note that UGS does not sponsor its own
 lectures in the spring. For additional event details, see http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/uls. Bring your UT ID, as
 they have required this in years past for admittance.

Note that students are “assigned” a TA for support and grading purposes (see list above). You will have the same TA grading all of your assignments; this is the person you should work with throughout the semester. Of course, you are welcome (and encouraged!) to see Prof. McDaniel and Prof Shaw as well! But when it comes to evaluation, this system ensures that the person you talk to in office hours is actually the person who will be reading and grading your assignments. Thus, each student should (if they so desire) develop a more personal and edifying professional relationship with their TA.     Contact any/all Teaching Assistants at onlinegov310ta@austin.utexas.edu  Contact technical support at Online Course Tech Support Chat  Very soon, there will be a google doc on the course’s Canvas Homepage to sign up for virtual office hours.   COURSE OVERVIEW This course is an introduction to American government and politics.  While our main focus is on the national level,  additional  attention  is  paid  to the  state  and  local  governments  of  Texas.  In  some  instances,  the 
 2 American case is placed in a comparative context derived from the experience of other western democratic nations.  In  other  instances,  we  focus  on  changes  over  time  within  the  American  political  system  to demonstrate  how  principles  often  change  with  context.  At  all  times  we  are  interested  in  a  better understanding of how this particular system has developed and what it means for citizens of the United States.  There are three primary objectives in this course.  The first is to provide basic descriptive information about the  American  and  Texas  political  systems  by  examining  important  political  processes,  institutions,  and actors.  The  second  is to  develop  analytical  skills  by  which  to  understand  complex  relationships  and phenomena.  The third is to introduce the work of the political scientist by concentrating on the paradigms and techniques of the discipline.  COURSE MATERIALS  We  are  using  the Texas  Politics webtext.  ISBN 978-1-949164-62-6, Soomo  Learning  (2020).  You  can purchase access to the webtext which includes all of the Texas politics content directly through Canvas at $55 or buy a passkey from the Co-Op bookstore for approximately $73.39. The second option will allow you to use your financial aid.  For instructions on how to register for the webtext, use the student quick start guide. You can access it by clicking here.     NOTE: If you have already completed a course that has used the Texas Politics webtext, you can have your payment applied  to the  total  price of the  webtext  by  emailing  Soomo  Learning's  Student  Support at support@soomolearning.com. Please provide the course information from your previous course.  COURSE FORMAT This  is the on-demand  digital  version  of the  American  Government  course.  Unlike  most  of the  courses offered at the University of Texas, you will be viewing this class online (from the comfort of your own home, library, or coffee joint) rather than in-person. You are expected to “attend” class by logging into the course site to watch recorded lectures that have already been posted to Canvas.  There are no preset times that students are required to log in to view the recorded lectures.  Students can view them at any time day or night.  In addition to the lecture modules, for each weekly topic we will also offer a “10 Good Minutes” interview. Experts on different subjects within American Politics are interviewed about their research and thoughts on the current state of affairs. Our goal with these segments is to introduce students to the world of social scientific research and to a variety of viewpoints about how to study American politics.   Outside  of  the  lecture  modules,  we  occasionally  ask  students  to  listen  to  a  podcast  or  watch  a  short instructional video. These are designed to supplement the ideas and information offered in lecture, and to enhance our students’ understanding of how theories and concepts can be applied to real-world issues and problems. These materials are identified on the course schedule, and (unless otherwise noted) are required (that is, information discussed in these could be on the exams!).   Beyond the lecture modules and attendant supplementary materials, we will also offer weekly updates on the class and what’s going on in the world in the form a short video (20 minutes or so), to be posted on Mondays. These videos will also be available on demand, and we strongly urge students to watch each of them.    They  should  help  you  stay  abreast  of  how  the  class  is  proceeding,  and  might  personalize  your experience. The discussion of current events is to help contextualize the course with events happening in the U.S. and the world. Although we do not ask about these current events discussions on the exams, we do ask that you complete a short quiz on these videos every week (more on this later).   

 3 Before beginning this course, there are a few important additional information items to cover. To access everything associated with the class, simply go to: https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1301346   You can enter directly from the internet or through Canvas (https://utexas.instructure.com/).  To log in to Canvas and the class website, you will need your UT EID and password. Once you reach the class website, you can navigate your way to other areas. Some of the most important include:  ฀ Homepage  –  The  Homepage  will  have  links  to the  Modules,  information  regarding  technical questions, as well as contact information for the instructors and teaching assistants.  On the left-hand side of  each page of the Canvas course site  are navigation tabs to all  parts of the website, including the Syllabus.   ฀ Modules – The Modules page includes a listing of the reading assignments, as well as links to the lecture  videos,  graded  assignments,  and  other  course  documents.  Each  module  contains  the collection of reading, videos, and graded assignments organized around a particular course subject. Note that the readings and links may change up to about a week before the listed date.  Due dates for the reading assignments can also be accessed via the Calendar feature. o Pre-Class Activities – At top of the homepage, you’ll find the Pre-Class Activities Module. You should complete all pre-class activities before the first day of class. A lot of effort has been put into these activities to answer questions you may have about the course. Activities include information on the syllabus, a FAQ page, a technical requirements and testing page, and other helpful tips for doing well in the course. ฀ Announcements Page – The Announcements feature is the primary mode of communication from the instructors to students. You can access it on the left-hand side of Canvas or through a link on the  Homepage.  Students  should  be  sure  that  their  Canvas  settings  enable  them  to  receive announcements via email. ฀ Grades – We organize the gradebook by individual assignment as well as assignment group.  ฀ Zoom – This is where you can access professor and TA office hours discussion, as well as the weekly update videos (under “Cloud Recordings”).  Most of your activity on Canvas will take place in the Modules tab.     TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS Required Internet-Enabled Device All  students  are  required  to  have  access  to  a laptop or desktop  computer,  running either Windows or macOS operating  systems.  (Tablets,  smartphones,  and  Microsoft  Surface  devices  are not supported.)  Your computer should meet the following requirements: • Modern and up-to-date operating system (macOS or Windows) • Browser:  Chrome  (highly  recommended),  Safari  or  Firefox   (If  using  Safari  or  Firefox,  be  prepared to download Chrome (Links to an external site.) and use it.) • 5 Mbps internet connection speed (check your speed here (Links to an external site.)) • Functional webcam and microphone • Zoom installed and configured Confirm that your computer is able to stream video by visiting https://www.laits.utexas.edu/tower/tech.php (Links to an external site.) For the best class experience: •  Close all unnecessary browser windows and tabs and programs o  Streaming music (Pandora, Spotify, etc.) o  Social media sites o  Youtube or other video sites o  Online/Offline Gaming 
 4 •  Clear the browser's cache before class (here's how (Links to an external site.)) •  Check  your  computer  is  free  of  viruses,  malware,  and  spyware  (UT  recommendations (Links  to an external site.))  There are multiple computer labs on campus for your use if you do not have a personal computer or laptop.  (You can find a listing of these labs here.)If you do not have an internet-enabled device, some inexpensive ones are available at local stores or on the internet, some for as little as $100.    Course Communication From the student’s perspective, the basic rules are as follows:  ฀ Do NOT use the Canvas mail system. This class is too large to manage student communication through  this  platform.  We  will  not be  checking  the  Canvas  inbox  regularly  so  please  send  your inquiries to one of the two communication avenues below: 1. Technical support can be obtained through the ""Online Tech Support Chat"" button on the left-hand menu in Canvas (not the professors or the TAs). 2. Substantive questions about the class, as well as questions concerning accommodations or study  habits  should  be  sent  directly  to the  professors  and/or  TAs  at onlinegov310ta@austin.utexas.edu. Or, better yet, come to office hours! Please abide by the  rules  of  respect  and  decorum  described  below  when  participating  in  any  course conversations.  Questions about grades will only be answered in-person during virtual office hours. We will not answer questions about grades by email.   From the professors’ and the TAs’ perspective, we will communicate important information through the video lectures, as well as the Announcements page on our course website. In light of this, please make sure you check the Announcements page on a daily basis.     Information and Data Security All examinations, exercises, assignments, and online interactions over the TOWER system will be saved and stored.  All information will be kept for educational and general academic research.  Any research or data sharing with other researchers will involve de-identifying the data, including the removal of names, UT EIDs, email addresses, or other information.  To further ensure that your information is secure, please do not include identifying information in your online interactions with others.  Also, remember that all information is stored on secure UT-Austin computer servers.  In online interactions with others, remember that the professors and TAs will have access to all information.  COURSE EVALUATION & GRADES Here is a quick overview of what you will need to do, with more specific information offered further below.  First, there will be three midterm examinations. They are each worth 100 points. The exams will be given online at the appointed times and dates, and encompass 50 multiple-choice questions, 5 identification items you  choose  five  from  eight  options),  and  one  short  essay  (you  choose  one  prompt  from  two  or  three options). The exams are NOT cumulative.  Second,  there  will  be  fourteen  (14)  weekly  quizzes  associated  with  the “Weekly  Update/In  the  News” videos worth 100 points (your best 10 webtext chapter scores count, with each being worth 10 points).   Third and finally, there will be fourteen (14) weekly webtext assignments worth 100 points (your best 10 webtext chapter scores count, with each being worth 10 points).   

 5 This yields 500 total points available in the class.  EVALUATION ITEM POINTS DUE DATE    MIDTERM 1 100 Monday, Feb. 22 7:00-9:00 PM Central MIDTERM 2 100 Monday, Apr. 5 7:00-9:00 PM Central MIDTERM 3 100 Monday, May 10 7:00-9:00 PM Central    WEEKLY UPDATE/IN THE NEWS QUIZZES 100 Most every Friday @ 5:00 PM Central (10 best grades count/Each is worth 10 points)      WEBTEXT ASSIGNMENTS 100 Most every Friday @ 5:00 PM Central (10 best grades count/Each is worth 10 points)      TOTAL 500   Midterms The midterm exams will cover lecture and webtext materials. The exams consist of three different sections: (a) 50 multiple-choice questions; (b) 5 identification items, and (c) one short essay. You will have two hours (120 minutes) to complete the exam.  Multiple Choice We break the 50 questions down as follows: one-third of the questions will be drawn from Prof. McDaniel’s lectures, one-third will be drawn from Prof. Shaw’s lectures, and one-third will come from the webtext. Each item will have 4-5 possible response options. Supplemental materials (such as the “Ten Good Minutes” segments from within the lecture modules, or assigned podcasts) will be in play for the exams, although you are unlikely to get more than a few questions from these materials. Items will also give equal weight to the different topics covered during the given trimester.   Identification We will  offer approximately  eight identification  items,  from  which you will choose five about which  to write. You should define the term, and then briefly describe why it is important to the study of politics and governance. We expect these responses to be very short: 2-3 sentences should be more than adequate. Each item is worth 6 points, so that this section of the midterm is worth 30 points total.  Short Essays We will offer two or three potential essay prompts, from which you will write one essay. You should answer all elements of the prompt. We do not anticipate that you will need to write more than 4-5 paragraphs.  In General These exams are NOT cumulative.  The first exam will cover the reading and lecture material from the first day of class until the class immediately prior to the exam.  The last two exams will cover the material from the class immediately after the prior exam up until the class immediately before the scheduled exam.   Please note the dates and times of these exams and make sure that you are able to complete all exams. We will  consider  make-up  exams  for  students  with  compelling  (that  is,  university-sanctioned)  medical, educational,  or  personal  circumstances.  Please  be  prepared  to  offer  appropriate  documentation.  Also, please consult university guidelines on these matters, as standards and expectations are shifting in light of COVID-19.  Note also that we do NOT offer make-up exams simply because a particular exam time is inconvenient. Given the number of students enrolled in the course, this would be unfair as well as a logistical nightmare. Please contact us as soon as possible if there is a conflict.  
 6 Remember, the exam starts at 7:00 pm Central Time.  Please set up no later than 6:50 pm to insure that you have no technical issues. The exam ends promptly at 9:00 pm Central Time. We conduct the midterm exams online. We use the Proctorio test-taking tool, which requires that you use a Chrome browser AND that you install the Proctorio Chrome browser extension. Please see the following site for more information: https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/option3/Using+Proctorio+in+Canvas Students WILL be able to access the lecture outlines (PowerPoint slides) and their notes for the exams.  Students will NOT be able to access the lecture modules, webtext chapters, outside internet sites, or Google docs for the exams.  Weekly Update/In the News Quizzes As noted above, we will post a Weekly Update/In the News video most every Monday (beginning on Week 2; no video will be posted during the week of Spring Break). We will ask you to complete a brief quiz based on each of these videos. The quizzes consist of ten questions, and are worth a total of 10 points each. You will not be able to re-take the quiz; unlike the “Get the Gist” quizzes, your initial submitted response is your official answer. Your top 10 scores will determine your point total for this element of the course. Each quiz must be completed by 5:00 pm Central Time on the due date (Friday of the given week). Since you can drop your four low scores, we will not consider exceptions to these deadlines. If you cannot take the quiz due to extenuating circumstances, just use one of your “drop” scores.  Webtext Assignments The webtext will offer study questions and response boards that students will be asked to complete. Each chapter will be worth 10 points, with your top 10 chapter scores contributing to your point total for this element of the course. You must answer these “Get the Gist” questions correctly to receive credit. You may reset the answers to all the questions on a page if you answer any of them incorrectly, but you will only have 3 total attempts to answer each set of questions correctly. A numerical score based on the percentage of total questions answered correctly will constitute your Texas Politics reading grade. Each assignment must be submitted by 5:00 pm Central Time on the due date (Friday of the given week). Once again, since you can drop your four low scores, we will not consider exceptions to these deadlines. If you cannot do the webtext assignment due to extenuating circumstances, just use one of your “drop” scores.  The Grading Scale The grading scale is as follows:  Points Letter  Grade Points Letter  Grade Points Letter Grade 465-500 A 385-399.99 C+ 335-349.99 D+ 450-464.99 A- 365-384.99 C 315-334.99 D 435-449.99 B+ 350-364.99 C- 300-314.99 D- 415-434.99 B   0-299.99 F 400-414.99 B-      Please note that your grade is determined by your overall point total; percentages are used to determine the  cut-points,  but  are  otherwise  irrelevant  for  your  grade.  This  can  be  somewhat  confusing,  because Canvas automatically produces percentages in their grade scoring algorithms.  With respect to rounding, we typically round down when determining the cut-points. However, we do NOT then go ahead and round student point totals up. We can only take charity so far. In light of this, please refrain from asking us to “round up” your grade at the  end of the semester. We cannot do this without 

 7 offering the same to everyone else, and we are not prepared to thus destroy the integrity of the evaluative process.  Finally, we reserve the right to use a curve, which would take the top score in the course and “percentage” off of that number to determine cut-points. For example, say the top score were 495. We might then take 93% of this to set the A range at 460-500, the A- range at 445-459.99 (90% * 495), etc. We emphasize that students should NOT expect a curve; it is something that we occasionally use if we think it appropriate given the overall distribution of scores.  More information on this will come later in the class, if necessary.   Important Notes on Requirements and Evaluations • There is no final exam associated with this class. Final grades will be posted 48 hours prior to the official deadline from the College of Liberal Arts. • PLEASE NOTE: To receive credit for this course, students will need to…  o Complete all three midterm assignments, and  o Complete at least 7 Weekly Update/In the News quizzes, and   o Complete at least 7 webtext chapter assignments. These requirements are critical: Even if you have enough points for, say, a C in the course, you need to complete these assignments to pass. Failure to do so will result in a failing grade. • The readings, lectures, and short essay assignments are all designed to prepare you for the exams. There should be no surprises and you should do well if you do the readings, watch the videos, take notes, complete all short essay assignments, and pay attention to where you may need to allocate resources to studying.  Procedures for Dealing with Grade Concerns While we are always happy to discuss substantive issues and how to improve your performance in the class, we insist on a more formal process if you wish us to re-grade your work. There are only two legitimate reasons  for  a  re-grade  request.  First,  if you  wrote  something  that  was  correct  and  we  identified  it as incorrect. Second, if you wrote something that was clearly mischaracterized by us during evaluation. If you believe one or both of these situations pertains to your work, you can formally request that we re-grade a specific exam. Such a request must adhere to the following procedure: • The first step is to visit the TA who graded the assignment in office hours. A simple “face-to-face” may alleviate your questions or concerns.  • If you still think one or both of the two situations described above pertains, then you should proceed to a written request. All grade complaints must be TYPED and must clearly express the student’s specific  concerns.   These  written statements  must  be accompanied by citations  of  support  from course materials, i.e. readings, textbook, and/or lecture notes, in order to ensure accuracy. Please limit this statement  to one page.  These statements should be  submitted to Prof. Shaw and Prof. McDaniel. • Written  statements  may be  submitted  for  consideration AFTER one  week  has  passed  since  the assignment was returned to students. This allows the student time to re-read his/her answers and think carefully about what improvements could have been made. • Grade  complaints  will  not be considered once two  weeks have passed after the grade  has  been given.   For  example,  if we  return  a  graded  assignment  on  March  1st,  students  must  submit  a complaint BEFORE 5:00  PM  Central  Time  on  March  15th.   After  that  day,  no  complaints  will  be considered for that assignment. • Finally, submitting a grade grievance will result in a complete re-grade of the assignment. In other words, you cannot cherry-pick what we review. We will re-grade all responses. Just as we may have erred to your detriment on one item, we might have erred in your favor on another.

You will have the same TA grading all of your assignments; this is the person you should work with throughout the semester. Of course, you are welcome (and encouraged!) to see as well! But when it comes to evaluation, this system ensures that the person you talk to in office hours is actually the person who will be reading and grading your assignments.

COURSE OVERVIEW This course is an introduction to American government and politics.  While our main focus is on the national level,  additional  attention  is  paid  to the  state  and  local  governments  of  Texas.  In  some  instances,  the 
 2 American case is placed in a comparative context derived from the experience of other western democratic nations.  In  other  instances,  we  focus  on  changes  over  time  within  the  American  political  system  to demonstrate  how  principles  often  change  with  context.  At  all  times  we  are  interested  in  a  better understanding of how this particular system has developed and what it means for citizens of the United States.  There are three primary objectives in this course.  The first is to provide basic descriptive information about the  American  and  Texas  political  systems  by  examining  important  political  processes,  institutions,  and actors.  The  second  is to  develop  analytical  skills  by  which  to  understand  complex  relationships  and phenomena.  The third is to introduce the work of the political scientist by concentrating on the paradigms and techniques of the discipline.  COURSE MATERIALS  We  are  using  the Texas  Politics webtext.  ISBN 978-1-949164-62-6, Soomo  Learning  (2020).  You  can purchase access to the webtext which includes all of the Texas politics content directly through Canvas at $55 or buy a passkey from the Co-Op bookstore for approximately $73.39. The second option will allow you to use your financial aid.  For instructions on how to register for the webtext, use the student quick start guide. You can access it by clicking here.     NOTE: If you have already completed a course that has used the Texas Politics webtext, you can have your payment applied  to the  total  price of the  webtext  by  emailing  Soomo  Learning's  Student  Support at support@soomolearning.com. Please provide the course information from your previous course.  COURSE FORMAT This  is the on-demand  digital  version  of the  American  Government  course.  Unlike  most  of the  courses offered at the University of Texas, you will be viewing this class online (from the comfort of your own home, library, or coffee joint) rather than in-person. You are expected to “attend” class by logging into the course site to watch recorded lectures that have already been posted to Canvas.  There are no preset times that students are required to log in to view the recorded lectures.  Students can view them at any time day or night.  In addition to the lecture modules, for each weekly topic we will also offer a “10 Good Minutes” interview. Experts on different subjects within American Politics are interviewed about their research and thoughts on the current state of affairs. Our goal with these segments is to introduce students to the world of social scientific research and to a variety of viewpoints about how to study American politics.   Outside  of  the  lecture  modules,  we  occasionally  ask  students  to  listen  to  a  podcast  or  watch  a  short instructional video. These are designed to supplement the ideas and information offered in lecture, and to enhance our students’ understanding of how theories and concepts can be applied to real-world issues and problems. These materials are identified on the course schedule, and (unless otherwise noted) are required (that is, information discussed in these could be on the exams!).   Beyond the lecture modules and attendant supplementary materials, we will also offer weekly updates on the class and what’s going on in the world in the form a short video (20 minutes or so), to be posted on Mondays. These videos will also be available on demand, and we strongly urge students to watch each of them.    They  should  help  you  stay  abreast  of  how  the  class  is  proceeding,  and  might  personalize  your experience. The discussion of current events is to help contextualize the course with events happening in the U.S. and the world. Although we do not ask about these current events discussions on the exams, we do ask that you complete a short quiz on these videos every week (more on this later).   

 3 Before beginning this course, there are a few important additional information items to cover. To access everything associated with the class, simply go to: https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1301346   You can enter directly from the internet or through Canvas (https://utexas.instructure.com/).  To log in to Canvas and the class website, you will need your UT EID and password. Once you reach the class website, you can navigate your way to other areas. Some of the most important include:  ฀ Homepage  –  The  Homepage  will  have  links  to the  Modules,  information  regarding  technical questions, as well as contact information for the instructors and teaching assistants.  On the left-hand side of  each page of the Canvas course site  are navigation tabs to all  parts of the website, including the Syllabus.   ฀ Modules – The Modules page includes a listing of the reading assignments, as well as links to the lecture  videos,  graded  assignments,  and  other  course  documents.  Each  module  contains  the collection of reading, videos, and graded assignments organized around a particular course subject. Note that the readings and links may change up to about a week before the listed date.  Due dates for the reading assignments can also be accessed via the Calendar feature. o Pre-Class Activities – At top of the homepage, you’ll find the Pre-Class Activities Module. You should complete all pre-class activities before the first day of class. A lot of effort has been put into these activities to answer questions you may have about the course. Activities include information on the syllabus, a FAQ page, a technical requirements and testing page, and other helpful tips for doing well in the course. ฀ Announcements Page – The Announcements feature is the primary mode of communication from the instructors to students. You can access it on the left-hand side of Canvas or through a link on the  Homepage.  Students  should  be  sure  that  their  Canvas  settings  enable  them  to  receive announcements via email. ฀ Grades – We organize the gradebook by individual assignment as well as assignment group.  ฀ Zoom – This is where you can access professor and TA office hours discussion, as well as the weekly update videos (under “Cloud Recordings”).  Most of your activity on Canvas will take place in the Modules tab.     TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS Required Internet-Enabled Device All  students  are  required  to  have  access  to  a laptop or desktop  computer,  running either Windows or macOS operating  systems.  (Tablets,  smartphones,  and  Microsoft  Surface  devices  are not supported.)  Your computer should meet the following requirements: • Modern and up-to-date operating system (macOS or Windows) • Browser:  Chrome  (highly  recommended),  Safari  or  Firefox   (If  using  Safari  or  Firefox,  be  prepared to download Chrome (Links to an external site.) and use it.) • 5 Mbps internet connection speed (check your speed here (Links to an external site.)) • Functional webcam and microphone • Zoom installed and configured Confirm that your computer is able to stream video by visiting https://www.laits.utexas.edu/tower/tech.php (Links to an external site.)

There are multiple computer labs on campus for your use if you do not have a personal computer or laptop.  (You can find a listing of these labs here.)If you do not have an internet-enabled device, some inexpensive ones are available at local stores or on the internet, some for as little as $100.    Course Communication From the student’s perspective, the basic rules are as follows:  ฀ Do NOT use the Canvas mail system. This class is too large to manage student communication through  this  platform.  We  will  not be  checking  the  Canvas  inbox  regularly  so  please  send  your inquiries to one of the two communication avenues below: 1. Technical support can be obtained through the ""Online Tech Support Chat"" button on the left-hand menu in Canvas (not the professors or the TAs). 2. Substantive questions about the class, as well as questions concerning accommodations or study  habits  should  be  sent  directly  to the  professors  and/or  TAs  at onlinegov310ta@austin.utexas.edu. Or, better yet, come to office hours! Please abide by the  rules  of  respect  and  decorum  described  below  when  participating  in  any  course conversations.  Questions about grades will only be answered in-person during virtual office hours. We will not answer questions about grades by email.   From the professors’ and the TAs’ perspective, we will communicate important information through the video lectures, as well as the Announcements page on our course website. In light of this, please make sure you check the Announcements page on a daily basis.     Information and Data Security All examinations, exercises, assignments, and online interactions over the TOWER system will be saved and stored.  All information will be kept for educational and general academic research.  Any research or data sharing with other researchers will involve de-identifying the data, including the removal of names, UT EIDs, email addresses, or other information.  To further ensure that your information is secure, please do not include identifying information in your online interactions with others.  Also, remember that all information is stored on secure UT-Austin computer servers.  In online interactions with others, remember that the professors and TAs will have access to all information.  COURSE EVALUATION & GRADES Here is a quick overview of what you will need to do, with more specific information offered further below.  First, there will be three midterm examinations. They are each worth 100 points. The exams will be given online at the appointed times and dates, and encompass 50 multiple-choice questions, 5 identification items you  choose  five  from  eight  options),  and  one  short  essay  (you  choose  one  prompt  from  two  or  three options). The exams are NOT cumulative.  Second,  there  will  be  fourteen  (14)  weekly  quizzes  associated  with  the “Weekly  Update/In  the  News” videos worth 100 points (your best 10 webtext chapter scores count, with each being worth 10 points).   Third and finally, there will be fourteen (14) weekly webtext assignments worth 100 points (your best 10 webtext chapter scores count, with each being worth 10 points).   

 5 This yields 500 total points available in the class.  EVALUATION ITEM POINTS DUE DATE    MIDTERM 1 100 Monday, Feb. 22 7:00-9:00 PM Central MIDTERM 2 100 Monday, Apr. 5 7:00-9:00 PM Central MIDTERM 3 100 Monday, May 10 7:00-9:00 PM Central    WEEKLY UPDATE/IN THE NEWS QUIZZES 100 Most every Friday @ 5:00 PM Central (10 best grades count/Each is worth 10 points)      WEBTEXT ASSIGNMENTS 100 Most every Friday @ 5:00 PM Central (10 best grades count/Each is worth 10 points)      TOTAL 500   Midterms The midterm exams will cover lecture and webtext materials. The exams consist of three different sections: (a) 50 multiple-choice questions; (b) 5 identification items, and (c) one short essay. You will have two hours (120 minutes) to complete the exam.  Multiple Choice We break the 50 questions down as follows: one-third of the questions will be drawn from Prof. McDaniel’s lectures, one-third will be drawn from Prof. Shaw’s lectures, and one-third will come from the webtext. Each item will have 4-5 possible response options. Supplemental materials (such as the “Ten Good Minutes” segments from within the lecture modules, or assigned podcasts) will be in play for the exams, although you are unlikely to get more than a few questions from these materials. Items will also give equal weight to the different topics covered during the given trimester.   Identification We will  offer approximately  eight identification  items,  from  which you will choose five about which  to write. You should define the term, and then briefly describe why it is important to the study of politics and governance. We expect these responses to be very short: 2-3 sentences should be more than adequate. Each item is worth 6 points, so that this section of the midterm is worth 30 points total.  Short Essays We will offer two or three potential essay prompts, from which you will write one essay. You should answer all elements of the prompt. We do not anticipate that you will need to write more than 4-5 paragraphs.  In General These exams are NOT cumulative.  The first exam will cover the reading and lecture material from the first day of class until the class immediately prior to the exam.  The last two exams will cover the material from the class immediately after the prior exam up until the class immediately before the scheduled exam.   Please note the dates and times of these exams and make sure that you are able to complete all exams. We will  consider  make-up  exams  for  students  with  compelling  (that  is,  university-sanctioned)  medical, educational,  or  personal  circumstances.  Please  be  prepared  to  offer  appropriate  documentation.  Also, please consult university guidelines on these matters, as standards and expectations are shifting in light of COVID-19.  Note also that we do NOT offer make-up exams simply because a particular exam time is inconvenient. Given the number of students enrolled in the course, this would be unfair as well as a logistical nightmare. Please contact us as soon as possible if there is a conflict.  
 6 Remember, the exam starts at 7:00 pm Central Time.  Please set up no later than 6:50 pm to insure that you have no technical issues. The exam ends promptly at 9:00 pm Central Time. We conduct the midterm exams online. We use the Proctorio test-taking tool, which requires that you use a Chrome browser AND that you install the Proctorio Chrome browser extension. Please see the following site for more information: https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/option3/Using+Proctorio+in+Canvas Students WILL be able to access the lecture outlines (PowerPoint slides) and their notes for the exams.  Students will NOT be able to access the lecture modules, webtext chapters, outside internet sites, or Google docs for the exams.  Weekly Update/In the News Quizzes As noted above, we will post a Weekly Update/In the News video most every Monday (beginning on Week 2; no video will be posted during the week of Spring Break). We will ask you to complete a brief quiz based on each of these videos. The quizzes consist of ten questions, and are worth a total of 10 points each. You will not be able to re-take the quiz; unlike the “Get the Gist” quizzes, your initial submitted response is your official answer. Your top 10 scores will determine your point total for this element of the course. Each quiz must be completed by 5:00 pm Central Time on the due date (Friday of the given week). Since you can drop your four low scores, we will not consider exceptions to these deadlines. If you cannot take the quiz due to extenuating circumstances, just use one of your “drop” scores.  Webtext Assignments The webtext will offer study questions and response boards that students will be asked to complete. Each chapter will be worth 10 points, with your top 10 chapter scores contributing to your point total for this element of the course. You must answer these “Get the Gist” questions correctly to receive credit. You may reset the answers to all the questions on a page if you answer any of them incorrectly, but you will only have 3 total attempts to answer each set of questions correctly. A numerical score based on the percentage of total questions answered correctly will constitute your Texas Politics reading grade. Each assignment must be submitted by 5:00 pm Central Time on the due date (Friday of the given week). Once again, since you can drop your four low scores, we will not consider exceptions to these deadlines. If you cannot do the webtext assignment due to extenuating circumstances, just use one of your “drop” scores.  The Grading Scale The grading scale is as follows:  Points Letter  Grade Points Letter  Grade Points Letter Grade 465-500 A 385-399.99 C+ 335-349.99 D+ 450-464.99 A- 365-384.99 C 315-334.99 D 435-449.99 B+ 350-364.99 C- 300-314.99 D- 415-434.99 B   0-299.99 F 400-414.99 B-      Please note that your grade is determined by your overall point total; percentages are used to determine the  cut-points,  but  are  otherwise  irrelevant  for  your  grade.  This  can  be  somewhat  confusing,  because Canvas automatically produces percentages in their grade scoring algorithms.  With respect to rounding, we typically round down when determining the cut-points. However, we do NOT then go ahead and round student point totals up. We can only take charity so far. In light of this, please refrain from asking us to “round up” your grade at the  end of the semester. We cannot do this without 

 7 offering the same to everyone else, and we are not prepared to thus destroy the integrity of the evaluative process.  Finally, we reserve the right to use a curve, which would take the top score in the course and “percentage” off of that number to determine cut-points. For example, say the top score were 495. We might then take 93% of this to set the A range at 460-500, the A- range at 445-459.99 (90% * 495), etc. We emphasize that students should NOT expect a curve; it is something that we occasionally use if we think it appropriate given the overall distribution of scores.  More information on this will come later in the class, if necessary.   Important Notes on Requirements and Evaluations • There is no final exam associated with this class. Final grades will be posted 48 hours prior to the official deadline from the College of Liberal Arts. • PLEASE NOTE: To receive credit for this course, students will need to…  o Complete all three midterm assignments, and  o Complete at least 7 Weekly Update/In the News quizzes, and   o Complete at least 7 webtext chapter assignments. These requirements are critical: Even if you have enough points for, say, a C in the course, you need to complete these assignments to pass. Failure to do so will result in a failing grade. • The readings, lectures, and short essay assignments are all designed to prepare you for the exams. There should be no surprises and you should do well if you do the readings, watch the videos, take notes, complete all short essay assignments, and pay attention to where you may need to allocate resources to studying.  Procedures for Dealing with Grade Concerns While we are always happy to discuss substantive issues and how to improve your performance in the class, we insist on a more formal process if you wish us to re-grade your work. There are only two legitimate reasons  for  a  re-grade  request.  First,  if you  wrote  something  that  was  correct  and  we  identified  it as incorrect. Second, if you wrote something that was clearly mischaracterized by us during evaluation. If you believe one or both of these situations pertains to your work, you can formally request that we re-grade a specific exam. Such a request must adhere to the following procedure: • The first step is to visit the TA who graded the assignment in office hours. A simple “face-to-face” may alleviate your questions or concerns.  • If you still think one or both of the two situations described above pertains, then you should proceed to a written request. All grade complaints must be TYPED and must clearly express the student’s specific  concerns.   These  written statements  must  be accompanied by citations  of  support  from course materials, i.e. readings, textbook, and/or lecture notes, in order to ensure accuracy. Please limit this statement  to one page.  These statements should be  submitted to Prof. Shaw and Prof. McDaniel. • Written  statements  may be  submitted  for  consideration AFTER one  week  has  passed  since  the assignment was returned to students. This allows the student time to re-read his/her answers and think carefully about what improvements could have been made. • Grade  complaints  will  not be considered once two  weeks have passed after the grade  has  been given.   For  example,  if we  return  a  graded  assignment  on  March  1st,  students  must  submit  a complaint BEFORE 5:00  PM  Central  Time  on  March  15th.   After  that  day,  no  complaints  will  be considered for that assignment. • Finally, submitting a grade grievance will result in a complete re-grade of the assignment. In other words, you cannot cherry-pick what we review. We will re-grade all responses. Just as we may have erred to your detriment on one item, we might have erred in your favor on another.

You will have the same TA grading all of your assignments; this is the person you should work with throughout the semester. Of course, you are welcome (and encouraged!) to see as well! But when it comes to evaluation, this system ensures that the person you talk to in office hours is actually the person who will be reading and grading your assignments.

COURSE OVERVIEW This course is an introduction to American government and politics.  While our main focus is on the national level,  additional  attention  is  paid  to the  state  and  local  governments  of  Texas.  In  some  instances,  the 
 2 American case is placed in a comparative context derived from the experience of other western democratic nations.  In  other  instances,  we  focus  on  changes  over  time  within  the  American  political  system  to demonstrate  how  principles  often  change  with  context.  At  all  times  we  are  interested  in  a  better understanding of how this particular system has developed and what it means for citizens of the United States.  There are three primary objectives in this course.  The first is to provide basic descriptive information about the  American  and  Texas  political  systems  by  examining  important  political  processes,  institutions,  and actors.  The  second  is to  develop  analytical  skills  by  which  to  understand  complex  relationships  and phenomena.  The third is to introduce the work of the political scientist by concentrating on the paradigms and techniques of the discipline.  COURSE MATERIALS  We  are  using  the Texas  Politics webtext.  ISBN 978-1-949164-62-6, Soomo  Learning  (2020).  You  can purchase access to the webtext which includes all of the Texas politics content directly through Canvas at $55 or buy a passkey from the Co-Op bookstore for approximately $73.39. The second option will allow you to use your financial aid.  For instructions on how to register for the webtext, use the student quick start guide. You can access it by clicking here.     NOTE: If you have already completed a course that has used the Texas Politics webtext, you can have your payment applied  to the  total  price of the  webtext  by  emailing  Soomo  Learning's  Student  Support at support@soomolearning.com. Please provide the course information from your previous course.  COURSE FORMAT This  is the on-demand  digital  version  of the  American  Government  course.  Unlike  most  of the  courses offered at the University of Texas, you will be viewing this class online (from the comfort of your own home, library, or coffee joint) rather than in-person. You are expected to “attend” class by logging into the course site to watch recorded lectures that have already been posted to Canvas.  There are no preset times that students are required to log in to view the recorded lectures.  Students can view them at any time day or night.  In addition to the lecture modules, for each weekly topic we will also offer a “10 Good Minutes” interview. Experts on different subjects within American Politics are interviewed about their research and thoughts on the current state of affairs. Our goal with these segments is to introduce students to the world of social scientific research and to a variety of viewpoints about how to study American politics.   Outside  of  the  lecture  modules,  we  occasionally  ask  students  to  listen  to  a  podcast  or  watch  a  short instructional video. These are designed to supplement the ideas and information offered in lecture, and to enhance our students’ understanding of how theories and concepts can be applied to real-world issues and problems. These materials are identified on the course schedule, and (unless otherwise noted) are required (that is, information discussed in these could be on the exams!).   Beyond the lecture modules and attendant supplementary materials, we will also offer weekly updates on the class and what’s going on in the world in the form a short video (20 minutes or so), to be posted on Mondays. These videos will also be available on demand, and we strongly urge students to watch each of them.    They  should  help  you  stay  abreast  of  how  the  class  is  proceeding,  and  might  personalize  your experience. The discussion of current events is to help contextualize the course with events happening in the U.S. and the world. Although we do not ask about these current events discussions on the exams, we do ask that you complete a short quiz on these videos every week (more on this later).   

 3 Before beginning this course, there are a few important additional information items to cover. To access everything associated with the class, simply go to: https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1301346   You can enter directly from the internet or through Canvas (https://utexas.instructure.com/).  To log in to Canvas and the class website, you will need your UT EID and password. Once you reach the class website, you can navigate your way to other areas. Some of the most important include:  ฀ Homepage  –  The  Homepage  will  have  links  to the  Modules,  information  regarding  technical questions, as well as contact information for the instructors and teaching assistants.  On the left-hand side of  each page of the Canvas course site  are navigation tabs to all  parts of the website, including the Syllabus.   ฀ Modules – The Modules page includes a listing of the reading assignments, as well as links to the lecture  videos,  graded  assignments,  and  other  course  documents.  Each  module  contains  the collection of reading, videos, and graded assignments organized around a particular course subject. Note that the readings and links may change up to about a week before the listed date.  Due dates for the reading assignments can also be accessed via the Calendar feature. o Pre-Class Activities – At top of the homepage, you’ll find the Pre-Class Activities Module. You should complete all pre-class activities before the first day of class. A lot of effort has been put into these activities to answer questions you may have about the course. Activities include information on the syllabus, a FAQ page, a technical requirements and testing page, and other helpful tips for doing well in the course. ฀ Announcements Page – The Announcements feature is the primary mode of communication from the instructors to students. You can access it on the left-hand side of Canvas or through a link on the  Homepage.  Students  should  be  sure  that  their  Canvas  settings  enable  them  to  receive announcements via email. ฀ Grades – We organize the gradebook by individual assignment as well as assignment group.  ฀ Zoom – This is where you can access professor and TA office hours discussion, as well as the weekly update videos (under “Cloud Recordings”).  Most of your activity on Canvas will take place in the Modules tab.     TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS Required Internet-Enabled Device All  students  are  required  to  have  access  to  a laptop or desktop  computer,  running either Windows or macOS operating  systems.  (Tablets,  smartphones,  and  Microsoft  Surface  devices  are not supported.)

There are multiple computer labs on campus for your use if you do not have a personal computer or laptop.  (You can find a listing of these labs here.)If you do not have an internet-enabled device, some inexpensive ones are available at local stores or on the internet, some for as little as $100.    Course Communication From the student’s perspective, the basic rules are as follows:  ฀ Do NOT use the Canvas mail system. This class is too large to manage student communication through  this  platform.  We  will  not be  checking  the  Canvas  inbox  regularly  so  please  send  your inquiries to one of the two communication avenues below: 1. Technical support can be obtained through the ""Online Tech Support Chat"" button on the left-hand menu in Canvas (not the professors or the TAs). 2. Substantive questions about the class, as well as questions concerning accommodations or study  habits  should  be  sent  directly  to the  professors  and/or  TAs  at onlinegov310ta@austin.utexas.edu. Or, better yet, come to office hours! Please abide by the  rules  of  respect  and  decorum  described  below  when  participating  in  any  course conversations.  Questions about grades will only be answered in-person during virtual office hours. We will not answer questions about grades by email.   From the professors’ and the TAs’ perspective, we will communicate important information through the video lectures, as well as the Announcements page on our course website. In light of this, please make sure you check the Announcements page on a daily basis.     Information and Data Security All examinations, exercises, assignments, and online interactions over the TOWER system will be saved and stored.  All information will be kept for educational and general academic research.  Any research or data sharing with other researchers will involve de-identifying the data, including the removal of names, UT EIDs, email addresses, or other information.  To further ensure that your information is secure, please do not include identifying information in your online interactions with others.  Also, remember that all information is stored on secure UT-Austin computer servers.  In online interactions with others, remember that the professors and TAs will have access to all information.  COURSE EVALUATION & GRADES Here is a quick overview of what you will need to do, with more specific information offered further below.  First, there will be three midterm examinations. They are each worth 100 points. The exams will be given online at the appointed times and dates, and encompass 50 multiple-choice questions, 5 identification items you  choose  five  from  eight  options),  and  one  short  essay  (you  choose  one  prompt  from  two  or  three options). The exams are NOT cumulative.  Second,  there  will  be  fourteen  (14)  weekly  quizzes  associated  with  the “Weekly  Update/In  the  News” videos worth 100 points (your best 10 webtext chapter scores count, with each being worth 10 points).   Third and finally, there will be fourteen (14) weekly webtext assignments worth 100 points (your best 10 webtext chapter scores count, with each being worth 10 points).   

 5 This yields 500 total points available in the class.  EVALUATION ITEM POINTS DUE DATE    MIDTERM 1 100 Monday, Feb. 22 7:00-9:00 PM Central MIDTERM 2 100 Monday, Apr. 5 7:00-9:00 PM Central MIDTERM 3 100 Monday, May 10 7:00-9:00 PM Central    WEEKLY UPDATE/IN THE NEWS QUIZZES 100 Most every Friday @ 5:00 PM Central (10 best grades count/Each is worth 10 points)      WEBTEXT ASSIGNMENTS 100 Most every Friday @ 5:00 PM Central (10 best grades count/Each is worth 10 points)      TOTAL 500   Midterms The midterm exams will cover lecture and webtext materials. The exams consist of three different sections: (a) 50 multiple-choice questions; (b) 5 identification items, and (c) one short essay. You will have two hours (120 minutes) to complete the exam.  Multiple Choice We break the 50 questions down as follows: one-third of the questions will be drawn from Prof. McDaniel’s lectures, one-third will be drawn from Prof. Shaw’s lectures, and one-third will come from the webtext. Each item will have 4-5 possible response options. Supplemental materials (such as the “Ten Good Minutes” segments from within the lecture modules, or assigned podcasts) will be in play for the exams, although you are unlikely to get more than a few questions from these materials. Items will also give equal weight to the different topics covered during the given trimester.   Identification We will  offer approximately  eight identification  items,  from  which you will choose five about which  to write. You should define the term, and then briefly describe why it is important to the study of politics and governance. We expect these responses to be very short: 2-3 sentences should be more than adequate. Each item is worth 6 points, so that this section of the midterm is worth 30 points total.  Short Essays We will offer two or three potential essay prompts, from which you will write one essay. You should answer all elements of the prompt. We do not anticipate that you will need to write more than 4-5 paragraphs.  In General These exams are NOT cumulative.  The first exam will cover the reading and lecture material from the first day of class until the class immediately prior to the exam.  The last two exams will cover the material from the class immediately after the prior exam up until the class immediately before the scheduled exam.   Please note the dates and times of these exams and make sure that you are able to complete all exams. We will  consider  make-up  exams  for  students  with  compelling  (that  is,  university-sanctioned)  medical, educational,  or  personal  circumstances.  Please  be  prepared  to  offer  appropriate  documentation.  Also, please consult university guidelines on these matters, as standards and expectations are shifting in light of COVID-19.  Note also that we do NOT offer make-up exams simply because a particular exam time is inconvenient. Given the number of students enrolled in the course, this would be unfair as well as a logistical nightmare. Please contact us as soon as possible if there is a conflict.  
 6 Remember, the exam starts at 7:00 pm Central Time.  Please set up no later than 6:50 pm to insure that you have no technical issues. The exam ends promptly at 9:00 pm Central Time. We conduct the midterm exams online. We use the Proctorio test-taking tool, which requires that you use a Chrome browser AND that you install the Proctorio Chrome browser extension. Please see the following site for more information: https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/option3/Using+Proctorio+in+Canvas Students WILL be able to access the lecture outlines (PowerPoint slides) and their notes for the exams.  Students will NOT be able to access the lecture modules, webtext chapters, outside internet sites, or Google docs for the exams.  Weekly Update/In the News Quizzes As noted above, we will post a Weekly Update/In the News video most every Monday (beginning on Week 2; no video will be posted during the week of Spring Break). We will ask you to complete a brief quiz based on each of these videos. The quizzes consist of ten questions, and are worth a total of 10 points each. You will not be able to re-take the quiz; unlike the “Get the Gist” quizzes, your initial submitted response is your official answer. Your top 10 scores will determine your point total for this element of the course. Each quiz must be completed by 5:00 pm Central Time on the due date (Friday of the given week). Since you can drop your four low scores, we will not consider exceptions to these deadlines. If you cannot take the quiz due to extenuating circumstances, just use one of your “drop” scores.  Webtext Assignments The webtext will offer study questions and response boards that students will be asked to complete. Each chapter will be worth 10 points, with your top 10 chapter scores contributing to your point total for this element of the course. You must answer these “Get the Gist” questions correctly to receive credit. You may reset the answers to all the questions on a page if you answer any of them incorrectly, but you will only have 3 total attempts to answer each set of questions correctly. A numerical score based on the percentage of total questions answered correctly will constitute your Texas Politics reading grade. Each assignment must be submitted by 5:00 pm Central Time on the due date (Friday of the given week). Once again, since you can drop your four low scores, we will not consider exceptions to these deadlines. If you cannot do the webtext assignment due to extenuating circumstances, just use one of your “drop” scores.  The Grading Scale The grading scale is as follows:  Points Letter  Grade Points Letter  Grade Points Letter Grade 465-500 A 385-399.99 C+ 335-349.99 D+ 450-464.99 A- 365-384.99 C 315-334.99 D 435-449.99 B+ 350-364.99 C- 300-314.99 D- 415-434.99 B   0-299.99 F 400-414.99 B-      Please note that your grade is determined by your overall point total; percentages are used to determine the  cut-points,  but  are  otherwise  irrelevant  for  your  grade.  This  can  be  somewhat  confusing,  because Canvas automatically produces percentages in their grade scoring algorithms.  With respect to rounding, we typically round down when determining the cut-points. However, we do NOT then go ahead and round student point totals up. We can only take charity so far. In light of this, please refrain from asking us to “round up” your grade at the  end of the semester. We cannot do this without 

 7 offering the same to everyone else, and we are not prepared to thus destroy the integrity of the evaluative process.  Finally, we reserve the right to use a curve, which would take the top score in the course and “percentage” off of that number to determine cut-points. For example, say the top score were 495. We might then take 93% of this to set the A range at 460-500, the A- range at 445-459.99 (90% * 495), etc. We emphasize that students should NOT expect a curve; it is something that we occasionally use if we think it appropriate given the overall distribution of scores.  More information on this will come later in the class, if necessary.   Important Notes on Requirements and Evaluations • There is no final exam associated with this class. Final grades will be posted 48 hours prior to the official deadline from the College of Liberal Arts. • PLEASE NOTE: To receive credit for this course, students will need to…  o Complete all three midterm assignments, and  o Complete at least 7 Weekly Update/In the News quizzes, and   o Complete at least 7 webtext chapter assignments. These requirements are critical: Even if you have enough points for, say, a C in the course, you need to complete these assignments to pass. Failure to do so will result in a failing grade. • The readings, lectures, and short essay assignments are all designed to prepare you for the exams. There should be no surprises and you should do well if you do the readings, watch the videos, take notes, complete all short essay assignments, and pay attention to where you may need to allocate resources to studying.  Procedures for Dealing with Grade Concerns While we are always happy to discuss substantive issues and how to improve your performance in the class, we insist on a more formal process if you wish us to re-grade your work. There are only two legitimate reasons  for  a  re-grade  request.  First,  if you  wrote  something  that  was  correct  and  we  identified  it as incorrect. Second, if you wrote something that was clearly mischaracterized by us during evaluation. If you believe one or both of these situations pertains to your work, you can formally request that we re-grade a specific exam. Such a request must adhere to the following procedure: • The first step is to visit the TA who graded the assignment in office hours. A simple “face-to-face” may alleviate your questions or concerns.  • If you still think one or both of the two situations described above pertains, then you should proceed to a written request. All grade complaints must be TYPED and must clearly express the student’s specific  concerns.   These  written statements  must  be accompanied by citations  of  support  from course materials, i.e. readings, textbook, and/or lecture notes, in order to ensure accuracy. Please limit this statement  to one page.  These statements should be  submitted to Prof. Shaw and Prof. McDaniel. • Written  statements  may be  submitted  for  consideration AFTER one  week  has  passed  since  the assignment was returned to students. This allows the student time to re-read his/her answers and think carefully about what improvements could have been made. • Grade  complaints  will  not be considered once two  weeks have passed after the grade  has  been given.   For  example,  if we  return  a  graded  assignment  on  March  1st,  students  must  submit  a complaint BEFORE 5:00  PM  Central  Time  on  March  15th.   After  that  day,  no  complaints  will  be considered for that assignment. • Finally, submitting a grade grievance will result in a complete re-grade of the assignment. In other words, you cannot cherry-pick what we review. We will re-grade all responses. Just as we may have erred to your detriment on one item, we might have erred in your favor on another.

Course Description
This class investigates fascism as an ideology, movement, and regime in a global
framework. We will start our investigation with the cases of Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s
Germany before broadening our perspective to Francoist Spain, Shōwa Statism in
Japan, and more recent manifestations of (post-)fascism in Latin America, Europe, and
across the world. As we expand our understanding of the phenomenon, we will explore
the regional inflections of fascism (such as the genocidal antisemitism of German
National Socialism) and common characteristics (such fascism’s embrace of violence as
a means of politics). Thematic perspectives include: the origins and theories of fascism,
key terms in the fascist lexicon, motives that brought people to fascism, fascism as an
aesthetics and lived experience, and the role of women in fascism. We will also study
the historical articulations of antifascism, i.e. those groups and individuals who have
fought against fascism over the years.
Throughout this course, we will interrogate the term “fascism,” asking what it means -
and what it means for us to use it. Today, politicians of all stripes deride their opponents
as “fascists.” Is it possible to apply this term productively? How can we define fascism,
and what are the stakes of using such language? Is there a difference between fascist,
fascistic, and fascistoid? To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, is there a there there?
Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to:
 Identify and historicize fascism’s intellectual and sociopolitical origins, as well as
its major characteristics;
 Compare and contrast fascist ideologies and movements from the 19th century to
the present in a global framework;
 Recognize and analyze different interpretations of and approaches to fascism;
 Make connections between past and present, using history to inform our
understanding of current events;
 Complete writing exercises for different academic and professional purposes,
including (but not limited to) op-eds, think pieces, and research essays.
1
Mode of Instruction
This course will take place entirely online. All class meetings, discussion sections, and
office hours will be held via Zoom. If there is anything that makes it difficult for you to
participate – technology trouble, internet access, time zones – please talk to us as soon
as possible.
Most of our Monday meetings will consist of recorded lectures, though some that
feature guest speakers will be held synchronously. Please refer to the syllabus for
details and watch our Collab page for updates. Our Wednesday meetings are
synchronous and attendance is mandatory. Recordings will be available upon request to
students who have a valid excuse for missing a class.
To facilitate a safe environment that encourages the free exchange of ideas, smallgroup discussions and sections will not be recorded. If you have to miss a section,
please contact your teaching assistant to schedule a make-up assignment.
A Note on Online Education
In a traditional face-to-face class, you are expected to read the assigned materials
before coming to class. While in the classroom (about three hours a week), you listen to
lectures, participate in discussions and activities, interact with your peers, and take
quizzes/exams. You have several larger out-of-class assignments on top of that.
Online classes are as demanding as face-to-face classes: after all, they teach
equivalent content. This class, therefore, also requires you to read first. Then for about
three hours a week you attend synchronous and asynchronous online lectures,
participate in virtual discussions, and complete online mini assignments. You also have
several larger out-of-class assignments on top of that.
It will be up to you, the students, to manage your time effectively, and to make sure that
you are setting aside the time each week to complete the readings and assignments on
time. We, your teaching team, will support you every step along the way. Please do not
hesitate to contact us if you have questions, need special accommodations, or would
like to chat about class topics.
All our class materials, with the exception of the required books, are available through
Collab. Collab is also where we will post updates, extra credit opportunities, and
potential tweaks to the syllabus - so watch the space closely.
This course covers war and genocide, as well as other violent historical events and
practices. We ask all students to help create an atmosphere of mutual respect and
sensitivity. When using our virtual classroom spaces, please adhere to the following
expectations for classroom conduct:
2
 Come prepared: do the readings, pay attention, and participate. Encourage
others to do the same.
 Listen: keep an open mind and let others present their reasoning and opinions.
Contribute to the discussion at hand, rather than taking the conversation off topic.
 Debate: share your point of view and encourage different perspectives. Tackle
the idea instead of the person.
 Respect diversity: use respectful language and avoid personal attacks and
assumptions about peoples’ backgrounds. Give others the benefit of the doubt by
not taking different opinions personally.
 Question: encourage debate and try to see things from different perspectives.
There is no such thing as a bad question.
This year more than ever, our class depends on your full participation. While on Zoom,
please refrain from using your computer for anything other than academic work. This
includes emailing, messaging, texting, txtng, skyping, google-earthing, facebooking,
myspacing, yourspacing, just spacing out, blogging, vlogging, twittering, tweeting,
surfing, turfing, yahooing, googling, giggling (might be okay in some circumstances),
snapchatting, pin-ing, pinteresting, tumblering, linking-in, linking-out, selfie-ing, and any
other social media-ting that we don’t yet know about. We’ll be watching!
If you feel comfortable, please leave the camera on during our course sessions. So
much of community is built in how we react to each other. Zoom is no substitute for
physical interaction, but at least with the video feature it doesn’t feel as though you are
speaking into a void.
Assignments and Grading
This class emphasizes continuous engagement with the weekly readings, discussions,
and lectures. There are six primary elements to the course requirements and
expectations.
15% Class engagement (attendance, participation, presentation, posts; graded
holistically)
5% Map quiz
25% Weekly responses (to be collected in an electronic learning portfolio)
15% Reflections on the portfolio (two-page midterm; thee-page final)
15% Take-home midterm exam (essay with a prompt or source analysis)
25% Final essay/op-ed (students taking the class C/NC can take the final exam
instead)
[25%] Optional final exam
Attendance: You should come to every class and section, read all assigned materials,
and watch any films or recorded lectures ahead of time. While we recognize the
volatility of our lives in these complicated times, we ask you to arrive to synchronous
meetings on time. Switch on your camera if you can. Please notify us of any technical
3
issues or changes in your health and environment that may make staying connected
difficult. We are here to support you!
Participation: This class depends on your active participation. Your contributions are
productive when you listen with an open mind, ask thoughtful questions, offer insightful
comments, note relevant passages in texts or films, and point out connections between
ideas.
Presentation: Once during the semester, you will be asked to make an oral presentation
in section. This will involve introducing a brief text and raising questions for discussion.
Your presentation should last about five minutes and will be integrated into our Zoom
meetings. Alternatively, you may submit your presentation in the form of a nonsynchronous PowerPoint video. Click here for instructions on how to convert
PowerPoint presentations into videos (it’s easy): https://www.youtube.com/watch?
 v=AGSk_ynrvTA.
Discussion Board: An online discussion board is one more way for you to contribute to
our class discussions. You can use it to raise a question; to make a comment on the
lecture or in-class conversation; or to post a link to a relevant news article. You can also
respond to your classmates’ posts, not just with “likes” but with substantive comments.
You should visit the discussion board at least once a week, and ideally more;
participation in this virtual space is a key aspect of our class discussion. Please
remember to be as courteous and respectful online as you are in the classroom.
Map Quiz: in section on Thursday, February 18, you will have a brief map quiz (20
minutes) on the geography of Europe and the world. You will be given a list of countries,
cities, and natural features that are important to the subject of this course, and you’ll be
asked to identify these on a blank map.
Weekly Responses: each week, you will submit a one-page (300-450 words) written
response to that week’s readings, lectures, and discussions. Your response should not
summarize these materials, but rather connect them to the main themes of the class.
How do each week’s materials shape your understanding of fascism? What new
aspects and/or experiences of fascism do they illuminate? What lessons can we draw
from them?
Your responses will receive check marks, indicating whether they did (or did not) fulfill
expectations. To receive full credit for this assignment, each response should:
 identify and develop at least one idea or theme,
 directly connect to the weekly course readings and discussions,
 demonstrate critical reflection and original thought.
Your weekly responses must be posted under the “Assignments” tab on Collab by the
end of the day (11:59 PM EST) on Wednesdays. Collab will not accept late responses.
Please contact your TA if you experience any problems with this assignment.
4
Portfolio: Over the course of the semester, you will write ten weekly responses in all. At
two points, we will ask you to re-read all the entries you’ve written and compile them
into a portfolio with a short (2-3 page) introduction. This portfolio will allow you to reflect
on the evolution of your own thinking and flesh out your understanding of what fascism
is and does. Your midterm portfolio is due on Wednesday, March 10, at 11:59PM (EST);
the final version is due on Wednesday, May 5, at 11:59PM (EST). As with all
assignments for this class, this is not the place for flattery or arguments you don’t
believe in.
Midterm Exam: You will have a take-home final exam due on Thursday, April 1, at
11:59PM (EST). It will consist of short answer and essay questions covering all the
material we’ve studied by that point in the course.
Final paper: Your final paper in this course is an opinion piece, or op-ed, that draws on
everything you’ve learned in this class to make an argument about current events. It is
due on Thursday, May 13, at 11:59PM (EST). Students who are taking this class on a
Credit/No Credit basis have the option of taking a final exam instead of the final paper.
Final Exam (optional): The final exam will include multiple-choice questions,
identifications, and short essay prompts. Its main purpose is to give credit/no credit
students the option to conclude the class with an alternative assignment. Students who
are taking this class for a letter grade are welcome to take the final exam, but they must
still submit a final paper. If you choose to complete both a final paper and a final exam,
the average of those two grades will account for 25% of the total.
Extra Credit: There will be several opportunities to earn extra credit over the course of
the semester, by attending (virtual) events or watching extra films and lectures - and
then writing brief responses to them. Stay tuned for more information. You can improve
your final grade by at most three percent (3%) through three extra credits (1% for each
extra credit activity), i.e. B → B+ or B+ → A-. To receive the maximum extra credit of
three percent (3%), you need to hand in three individual short assignments.
Rules and Policies
Grading Policy: Your written work will be assessed for clarity, originality, organization,
and the effective use of evidence from the readings, films, lectures and discussions. The
penalty for late papers is 1/3 of a letter grade for each 24 hours the work is overdue.
Late weekly responses will not be accepted without a valid excuse, but they can be
included in your learning portfolio for partial credit. Exceptions will be granted on the
grounds of documented illness or personal emergency.
If you are concerned about meeting any of the deadlines, please notify us well ahead of
time or as soon as you can. You will receive more information on all assignments as we
get closer to their due dates.
Academic Integrity: We trust that all work turned in for this class was composed
exclusively for this class, and that all wording and ideas presented in any written work
5
are your own. Always cite any sources and resources you use and be sure to use
bibliographic citations. Plagiarism is a serious academic offence. Definitions of what it is
and how to avoid it can be found at: https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/c.php?
g=535505&p=3663691.
When collaborating with other students, do not copy their answers. Always acknowledge
the individuals you consulted to complete an assignment and detail the nature of their
input. If you have a question about what is or is not permitted on an assignment, you
should clarify your question with your instructors prior to doing the work.
The Bylaws of the Honor Committee define an Honor offense as “a Significant Act of
Lying, Cheating or Stealing, which Act is committed with Knowledge.” By enrolling into
this class, you pledge to adhere to UVa’s Honor Code. If you believe you may have
committed an Honor Offense, you may wish to file a Conscientious Retraction (“CR”) by
calling the Honor Offices at (434) 924-7602. For your retraction to be considered valid, it
must, among other things, be filed with the Honor Committee before you are aware that
the act in question has come under suspicion by anyone. More information about UVa’s
Honor Code can be found at: https://honor.virginia.edu/.
Copyright: You may not record, download, alter, and/or distribute class lectures, lecture
slides, or any other element of this class. We will consider violations of this policy a
“significant act of stealing” and thus an honor offence. Violations of these terms may
also be subject to disciplinary action under the University’s Standards of Conduct; for
details, see https://ujc.virginia.edu/.
Your Safety and Wellbeing
We are living through the greatest public health emergency this country has seen in
over a century. Please stay safe and do your part to slow the rate of transmission. This
involves complying with all state and local regulations; following university policies; and
being courteous, considerate, and compassionate towards others.
It also means that little about this semester will be “normal.” Learning online is still a
fairly new experience for all of us, and it will require some trial and error. Lecture
formats, readings, and even assignments may all change as we go along; we’ll give you
as much notice as we can, and hope that you’ll bear with us. We also ask for your
feedback: what’s working, what’s not, and what we can do better. Feel free to email us,
or use the Anonymous Feedback tab on Collab.
We recognize that this semester brings new challenges and stresses. Here are a
number of ways to get help:
Instructor Support: Feel free to schedule individual Zoom or Skype sessions with us to
discuss drafts, ideas, and our comments on your work. We also understand that
personal circumstances or unforeseen events can interfere with your academic
responsibilities. We can meet during office hours or by appointment to discuss any
6
aspect of the course, difficulties you may be experiencing, or suggestions for making
the course more accessible.
The Writing Center offers online appointments in non-synchronous mode. Good writers
know that another pair of eyes on their work is always helpful.
The Student Disability Access Center offers a range of remote services including
assessments, consultations, and support with accommodations. We always make
accommodations for students with documented disabilities. Students should notify us
and the SDAC (sdac@virginia.edu) of disability-related needs.
UVA libraries feature many helpful staff members and librarians who can help you with
your research. One name to keep in mind is Keith Weimer (kw6m@virginia.edu),
Alderman’s research librarian for History, Politics, and Religious Studies. Mr. Weimer
knows everything about the library’s resources, both on paper and online. Do not
hesitate to contact him or his colleagues; they’re eager to hear from you!
The Office of the Dean of Students provides a list of resources that can help if you are
experiencing mental health, housing, safety, or food insecurity issues.

 Course Description
 This class investigates fascism as an ideology, movement, and regime in a global
 framework. We will start our investigation with the cases of Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s
 Germany before broadening our perspective to Francoist Spain, Shōwa Statism in
 Japan, and more recent manifestations of (post-)fascism in Latin America, Europe, and
 across the world. As we expand our understanding of the phenomenon, we will explore
 the regional inflections of fascism (such as the genocidal antisemitism of German
 National Socialism) and common characteristics (such fascism’s embrace of violence as
 a means of politics). Thematic perspectives include: the origins and theories of fascism,
 key terms in the fascist lexicon, motives that brought people to fascism, fascism as an
 aesthetics and lived experience, and the role of women in fascism. We will also study
 the historical articulations of antifascism, i.e. those groups and individuals who have
 fought against fascism over the years.
 Throughout this course, we will interrogate the term “fascism,” asking what it means -
 and what it means for us to use it. Today, politicians of all stripes deride their opponents
 as “fascists.” Is it possible to apply this term productively? How can we define fascism,
 and what are the stakes of using such language? Is there a difference between fascist,
 fascistic, and fascistoid? To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, is there a there there?
 Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to:
 · Identify and historicize fascism’s intellectual and sociopolitical origins, as well as
 its major characteristics;
 · Compare and contrast fascist ideologies and movements from the 19th century to
 the present in a global framework;
 · Recognize and analyze different interpretations of and approaches to fascism;
 · Make connections between past and present, using history to inform our
 understanding of current events;
 · Complete writing exercises for different academic and professional purposes,
 including (but not limited to) op-eds, think pieces, and research essays.

 Mode of Instruction
 This course will take place entirely online. All class meetings, discussion sections, and
 office hours will be held via Zoom. If there is anything that makes it difficult for you to
 participate – technology trouble, internet access, time zones – please talk to us as soon
 as possible.
 Most of our Monday meetings will consist of recorded lectures, though some that
 feature guest speakers will be held synchronously. Please refer to the syllabus for
 details and watch our Collab page for updates. Our Wednesday meetings are
 synchronous and attendance is mandatory. Recordings will be available upon request to
 students who have a valid excuse for missing a class.
 To facilitate a safe environment that encourages the free exchange of ideas, smallgroup discussions and sections will not be recorded. If you have to miss a section,
 please contact your teaching assistant to schedule a make-up assignment.
 A Note on Online Education
 In a traditional face-to-face class, you are expected to read the assigned materials
 before coming to class. While in the classroom (about three hours a week), you listen to
 lectures, participate in discussions and activities, interact with your peers, and take
 quizzes/exams. You have several larger out-of-class assignments on top of that.
 Online classes are as demanding as face-to-face classes: after all, they teach
 equivalent content. This class, therefore, also requires you to read first. Then for about
 three hours a week you attend synchronous and asynchronous online lectures,
 participate in virtual discussions, and complete online mini assignments. You also have
 several larger out-of-class assignments on top of that.
 It will be up to you, the students, to manage your time effectively, and to make sure that
 you are setting aside the time each week to complete the readings and assignments on
 time. We, your teaching team, will support you every step along the way. Please do not
 hesitate to contact us if you have questions, need special accommodations, or would
 like to chat about class topics.
 All our class materials, with the exception of the required books, are available through
 Collab. Collab is also where we will post updates, extra credit opportunities, and
 potential tweaks to the syllabus - so watch the space closely.
 This course covers war and genocide, as well as other violent historical events and
 practices. We ask all students to help create an atmosphere of mutual respect and
 sensitivity. When using our virtual classroom spaces, please adhere to the following
 expectations for classroom conduct:
 2
 · Come prepared: do the readings, pay attention, and participate. Encourage
 others to do the same.
 · Listen: keep an open mind and let others present their reasoning and opinions.
 Contribute to the discussion at hand, rather than taking the conversation off topic.
 · Debate: share your point of view and encourage different perspectives. Tackle
 the idea instead of the person.
 · Respect diversity: use respectful language and avoid personal attacks and
 assumptions about peoples’ backgrounds. Give others the benefit of the doubt by
 not taking different opinions personally.
 · Question: encourage debate and try to see things from different perspectives.
 There is no such thing as a bad question.
 This year more than ever, our class depends on your full participation. While on Zoom,
 please refrain from using your computer for anything other than academic work. This
 includes emailing, messaging, texting, txtng, skyping, google-earthing, facebooking,
 myspacing, yourspacing, just spacing out, blogging, vlogging, twittering, tweeting,
 surfing, turfing, yahooing, googling, giggling (might be okay in some circumstances),
 snapchatting, pin-ing, pinteresting, tumblering, linking-in, linking-out, selfie-ing, and any
 other social media-ting that we don’t yet know about. We’ll be watching!
 If you feel comfortable, please leave the camera on during our course sessions. So
 much of community is built in how we react to each other. Zoom is no substitute for
 physical interaction, but at least with the video feature it doesn’t feel as though you are
 speaking into a void.
 Assignments and Grading
 This class emphasizes continuous engagement with the weekly readings, discussions,
 and lectures. There are six primary elements to the course requirements and
 expectations.
 15% Class engagement (attendance, participation, presentation, posts; graded
 holistically)
 5% Map quiz
 25% Weekly responses (to be collected in an electronic learning portfolio)
 15% Reflections on the portfolio (two-page midterm; thee-page final)
 15% Take-home midterm exam (essay with a prompt or source analysis)
 25% Final essay/op-ed (students taking the class C/NC can take the final exam
 instead)
 [25%] Optional final exam
 Attendance: You should come to every class and section, read all assigned materials,
 and watch any films or recorded lectures ahead of time. While we recognize the
 volatility of our lives in these complicated times, we ask you to arrive to synchronous
 meetings on time. Switch on your camera if you can. Please notify us of any technical
 3
 issues or changes in your health and environment that may make staying connected
 difficult. We are here to support you!
 Participation: This class depends on your active participation. Your contributions are
 productive when you listen with an open mind, ask thoughtful questions, offer insightful
 comments, note relevant passages in texts or films, and point out connections between
 ideas.
 Presentation: Once during the semester, you will be asked to make an oral presentation
 in section. This will involve introducing a brief text and raising questions for discussion.
 Your presentation should last about five minutes and will be integrated into our Zoom
 meetings. Alternatively, you may submit your presentation in the form of a nonsynchronous PowerPoint video. Click here for instructions on how to convert
 PowerPoint presentations into videos (it’s easy): https://www.youtube.com/watch?
  v=AGSk_ynrvTA.
 Discussion Board: An online discussion board is one more way for you to contribute to
 our class discussions. You can use it to raise a question; to make a comment on the
 lecture or in-class conversation; or to post a link to a relevant news article. You can also
 respond to your classmates’ posts, not just with “likes” but with substantive comments.
 You should visit the discussion board at least once a week, and ideally more;
 participation in this virtual space is a key aspect of our class discussion. Please
 remember to be as courteous and respectful online as you are in the classroom.
 Map Quiz: in section on Thursday, February 18, you will have a brief map quiz (20
 minutes) on the geography of Europe and the world. You will be given a list of countries,
 cities, and natural features that are important to the subject of this course, and you’ll be
 asked to identify these on a blank map.
 Weekly Responses: each week, you will submit a one-page (300-450 words) written
 response to that week’s readings, lectures, and discussions. Your response should not
 summarize these materials, but rather connect them to the main themes of the class.
 How do each week’s materials shape your understanding of fascism? What new
 aspects and/or experiences of fascism do they illuminate? What lessons can we draw
 from them?
 Your responses will receive check marks, indicating whether they did (or did not) fulfill
 expectations. To receive full credit for this assignment, each response should:
 · identify and develop at least one idea or theme,
 · directly connect to the weekly course readings and discussions,
 · demonstrate critical reflection and original thought.
 Your weekly responses must be posted under the “Assignments” tab on Collab by the
 end of the day (11:59 PM EST) on Wednesdays. Collab will not accept late responses.
 Please contact your TA if you experience any problems with this assignment.
 4
 Portfolio: Over the course of the semester, you will write ten weekly responses in all. At
 two points, we will ask you to re-read all the entries you’ve written and compile them
 into a portfolio with a short (2-3 page) introduction. This portfolio will allow you to reflect
 on the evolution of your own thinking and flesh out your understanding of what fascism
 is and does. Your midterm portfolio is due on Wednesday, March 10, at 11:59PM (EST);
 the final version is due on Wednesday, May 5, at 11:59PM (EST). As with all
 assignments for this class, this is not the place for flattery or arguments you don’t
 believe in.
 Midterm Exam: You will have a take-home final exam due on Thursday, April 1, at
 11:59PM (EST). It will consist of short answer and essay questions covering all the
 material we’ve studied by that point in the course.
 Final paper: Your final paper in this course is an opinion piece, or op-ed, that draws on
 everything you’ve learned in this class to make an argument about current events. It is
 due on Thursday, May 13, at 11:59PM (EST). Students who are taking this class on a
 Credit/No Credit basis have the option of taking a final exam instead of the final paper.
 Final Exam (optional): The final exam will include multiple-choice questions,
 identifications, and short essay prompts. Its main purpose is to give credit/no credit
 students the option to conclude the class with an alternative assignment. Students who
 are taking this class for a letter grade are welcome to take the final exam, but they must
 still submit a final paper. If you choose to complete both a final paper and a final exam,
 the average of those two grades will account for 25% of the total.
 Extra Credit: There will be several opportunities to earn extra credit over the course of
 the semester, by attending (virtual) events or watching extra films and lectures - and
 then writing brief responses to them. Stay tuned for more information. You can improve
 your final grade by at most three percent (3%) through three extra credits (1% for each
 extra credit activity), i.e. B → B+ or B+ → A-. To receive the maximum extra credit of
 three percent (3%), you need to hand in three individual short assignments.
 Rules and Policies
 Grading Policy: Your written work will be assessed for clarity, originality, organization,
 and the effective use of evidence from the readings, films, lectures and discussions. The
 penalty for late papers is 1/3 of a letter grade for each 24 hours the work is overdue.
 Late weekly responses will not be accepted without a valid excuse, but they can be
 included in your learning portfolio for partial credit. Exceptions will be granted on the
 grounds of documented illness or personal emergency.
 If you are concerned about meeting any of the deadlines, please notify us well ahead of
 time or as soon as you can. You will receive more information on all assignments as we
 get closer to their due dates.
 Academic Integrity: We trust that all work turned in for this class was composed
 exclusively for this class, and that all wording and ideas presented in any written work
 5
 are your own. Always cite any sources and resources you use and be sure to use
 bibliographic citations. Plagiarism is a serious academic offence. Definitions of what it is
 and how to avoid it can be found at: https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/c.php?
 g=535505&p=3663691.
 When collaborating with other students, do not copy their answers. Always acknowledge
 the individuals you consulted to complete an assignment and detail the nature of their
 input. If you have a question about what is or is not permitted on an assignment, you
 should clarify your question with your instructors prior to doing the work.
 The Bylaws of the Honor Committee define an Honor offense as “a Significant Act of
 Lying, Cheating or Stealing, which Act is committed with Knowledge.” By enrolling into
 this class, you pledge to adhere to UVa’s Honor Code. If you believe you may have
 committed an Honor Offense, you may wish to file a Conscientious Retraction (“CR”) by
 calling the Honor Offices at (434) 924-7602. For your retraction to be considered valid, it
 must, among other things, be filed with the Honor Committee before you are aware that
 the act in question has come under suspicion by anyone. More information about UVa’s
 Honor Code can be found at: https://honor.virginia.edu/.
 Copyright: You may not record, download, alter, and/or distribute class lectures, lecture
 slides, or any other element of this class. We will consider violations of this policy a
 “significant act of stealing” and thus an honor offence. Violations of these terms may
 also be subject to disciplinary action under the University’s Standards of Conduct; for
 details, see https://ujc.virginia.edu/.
 Your Safety and Wellbeing
 We are living through the greatest public health emergency this country has seen in
 over a century. Please stay safe and do your part to slow the rate of transmission. This
 involves complying with all state and local regulations; following university policies; and
 being courteous, considerate, and compassionate towards others.
 It also means that little about this semester will be “normal.” Learning online is still a
 fairly new experience for all of us, and it will require some trial and error. Lecture
 formats, readings, and even assignments may all change as we go along; we’ll give you
 as much notice as we can, and hope that you’ll bear with us. We also ask for your
 feedback: what’s working, what’s not, and what we can do better. Feel free to email us,
 or use the Anonymous Feedback tab on Collab.
 We recognize that this semester brings new challenges and stresses. Here are a
 number of ways to get help:
 Instructor Support: Feel free to schedule individual Zoom or Skype sessions with us to
 discuss drafts, ideas, and our comments on your work. We also understand that
 personal circumstances or unforeseen events can interfere with your academic
 responsibilities. We can meet during office hours or by appointment to discuss any
 6
 aspect of the course, difficulties you may be experiencing, or suggestions for making
 the course more accessible.
 The Writing Center offers online appointments in non-synchronous mode. Good writers
 know that another pair of eyes on their work is always helpful.
 The Student Disability Access Center offers a range of remote services including
 assessments, consultations, and support with accommodations. We always make
 accommodations for students with documented disabilities. Students should notify us
 and the SDAC of disability-related needs.
 UVA libraries feature many helpful staff members and librarians who can help you with
 your research. One name to keep in mind is Keith Weimer Alderman’s research librarian for History, Politics, and Religious Studies. Mr. Weimer
 knows everything about the library’s resources, both on paper and online. Do not
 hesitate to contact him or his colleagues; they’re eager to hear from you!
 The Office of the Dean of Students provides a list of resources that can help if you are
 experiencing mental health, housing, safety, or food insecurity issues.
 If you or someone you know has experienced or witnessed incidents of bias, hazing, or
 sexual or gender-based violence, go to https://justreportit.virginia.edu/ to report such
 behaviors. Please note that your instructors are “responsible employees,” which means
 that they are required to report issues of violence to the University.
 Confidential employees are available if you want to discuss an issue related to violence
 in depth but want it to remain confidential.

 Course Description
 This class investigates fascism as an ideology, movement, and regime in a global
 framework. We will start our investigation with the cases of Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s
 Germany before broadening our perspective to Francoist Spain, Shōwa Statism in
 Japan, and more recent manifestations of (post-)fascism in Latin America, Europe, and
 across the world. As we expand our understanding of the phenomenon, we will explore
 the regional inflections of fascism (such as the genocidal antisemitism of German
 National Socialism) and common characteristics (such fascism’s embrace of violence as
 a means of politics). Thematic perspectives include: the origins and theories of fascism,
 key terms in the fascist lexicon, motives that brought people to fascism, fascism as an
 aesthetics and lived experience, and the role of women in fascism. We will also study
 the historical articulations of antifascism, i.e. those groups and individuals who have
 fought against fascism over the years.
 Throughout this course, we will interrogate the term “fascism,” asking what it means -
 and what it means for us to use it. Today, politicians of all stripes deride their opponents
 as “fascists.” Is it possible to apply this term productively? How can we define fascism,
 and what are the stakes of using such language? Is there a difference between fascist,
 fascistic, and fascistoid? To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, is there a there there?
 Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to:
 · Identify and historicize fascism’s intellectual and sociopolitical origins, as well as
 its major characteristics;
 · Compare and contrast fascist ideologies and movements from the 19th century to
 the present in a global framework;
 · Recognize and analyze different interpretations of and approaches to fascism;
 · Make connections between past and present, using history to inform our
 understanding of current events;
 · Complete writing exercises for different academic and professional purposes,
 including (but not limited to) op-eds, think pieces, and research essays.

 Mode of Instruction
 This course will take place entirely online. All class meetings, discussion sections, and
 office hours will be held via Zoom. If there is anything that makes it difficult for you to
 participate – technology trouble, internet access, time zones – please talk to us as soon
 as possible.
 Most of our Monday meetings will consist of recorded lectures, though some that
 feature guest speakers will be held synchronously. Please refer to the syllabus for
 details and watch our Collab page for updates. Our Wednesday meetings are
 synchronous and attendance is mandatory. Recordings will be available upon request to
 students who have a valid excuse for missing a class.
 To facilitate a safe environment that encourages the free exchange of ideas, smallgroup discussions and sections will not be recorded. If you have to miss a section,
 please contact your teaching assistant to schedule a make-up assignment.
 A Note on Online Education
 In a traditional face-to-face class, you are expected to read the assigned materials
 before coming to class. While in the classroom (about three hours a week), you listen to
 lectures, participate in discussions and activities, interact with your peers, and take
 quizzes/exams. You have several larger out-of-class assignments on top of that.
 Online classes are as demanding as face-to-face classes: after all, they teach
 equivalent content. This class, therefore, also requires you to read first. Then for about
 three hours a week you attend synchronous and asynchronous online lectures,
 participate in virtual discussions, and complete online mini assignments. You also have
 several larger out-of-class assignments on top of that.
 It will be up to you, the students, to manage your time effectively, and to make sure that
 you are setting aside the time each week to complete the readings and assignments on
 time. We, your teaching team, will support you every step along the way. Please do not
 hesitate to contact us if you have questions, need special accommodations, or would
 like to chat about class topics.
 All our class materials, with the exception of the required books, are available through
 Collab. Collab is also where we will post updates, extra credit opportunities, and
 potential tweaks to the syllabus - so watch the space closely.
 This course covers war and genocide, as well as other violent historical events and
 practices. We ask all students to help create an atmosphere of mutual respect and
 sensitivity. When using our virtual classroom spaces, please adhere to the following
 expectations for classroom conduct:
 2
 · Come prepared: do the readings, pay attention, and participate. Encourage
 others to do the same.
 · Listen: keep an open mind and let others present their reasoning and opinions.
 Contribute to the discussion at hand, rather than taking the conversation off topic.
 · Debate: share your point of view and encourage different perspectives. Tackle
 the idea instead of the person.
 · Respect diversity: use respectful language and avoid personal attacks and
 assumptions about peoples’ backgrounds. Give others the benefit of the doubt by
 not taking different opinions personally.
 · Question: encourage debate and try to see things from different perspectives.
 There is no such thing as a bad question.
 This year more than ever, our class depends on your full participation. While on Zoom,
 please refrain from using your computer for anything other than academic work. This
 includes emailing, messaging, texting, txtng, skyping, google-earthing, facebooking,
 myspacing, yourspacing, just spacing out, blogging, vlogging, twittering, tweeting,
 surfing, turfing, yahooing, googling, giggling (might be okay in some circumstances),
 snapchatting, pin-ing, pinteresting, tumblering, linking-in, linking-out, selfie-ing, and any
 other social media-ting that we don’t yet know about. We’ll be watching!
 If you feel comfortable, please leave the camera on during our course sessions. So
 much of community is built in how we react to each other. Zoom is no substitute for
 physical interaction, but at least with the video feature it doesn’t feel as though you are
 speaking into a void.
 Assignments and Grading
 This class emphasizes continuous engagement with the weekly readings, discussions,
 and lectures. There are six primary elements to the course requirements and
 expectations.
 15% Class engagement (attendance, participation, presentation, posts; graded
 holistically)
 5% Map quiz
 25% Weekly responses (to be collected in an electronic learning portfolio)
 15% Reflections on the portfolio (two-page midterm; thee-page final)
 15% Take-home midterm exam (essay with a prompt or source analysis)
 25% Final essay/op-ed (students taking the class C/NC can take the final exam
 instead)
 [25%] Optional final exam
 Attendance: You should come to every class and section, read all assigned materials,
 and watch any films or recorded lectures ahead of time. While we recognize the
 volatility of our lives in these complicated times, we ask you to arrive to synchronous
 meetings on time. Switch on your camera if you can. Please notify us of any technical
 3
 issues or changes in your health and environment that may make staying connected
 difficult. We are here to support you!
 Participation: This class depends on your active participation. Your contributions are
 productive when you listen with an open mind, ask thoughtful questions, offer insightful
 comments, note relevant passages in texts or films, and point out connections between
 ideas.
 Presentation: Once during the semester, you will be asked to make an oral presentation
 in section. This will involve introducing a brief text and raising questions for discussion.
 Your presentation should last about five minutes and will be integrated into our Zoom
 meetings. Alternatively, you may submit your presentation in the form of a nonsynchronous PowerPoint video. Click here for instructions on how to convert
 PowerPoint presentations into videos (it’s easy): https://www.youtube.com/watch?
  v=AGSk_ynrvTA.
 Discussion Board: An online discussion board is one more way for you to contribute to
 our class discussions. You can use it to raise a question; to make a comment on the
 lecture or in-class conversation; or to post a link to a relevant news article. You can also
 respond to your classmates’ posts, not just with “likes” but with substantive comments.
 You should visit the discussion board at least once a week, and ideally more;
 participation in this virtual space is a key aspect of our class discussion. Please
 remember to be as courteous and respectful online as you are in the classroom.
 Map Quiz: in section on Thursday, February 18, you will have a brief map quiz (20
 minutes) on the geography of Europe and the world. You will be given a list of countries,
 cities, and natural features that are important to the subject of this course, and you’ll be
 asked to identify these on a blank map.
 Weekly Responses: each week, you will submit a one-page (300-450 words) written
 response to that week’s readings, lectures, and discussions. Your response should not
 summarize these materials, but rather connect them to the main themes of the class.
 How do each week’s materials shape your understanding of fascism? What new
 aspects and/or experiences of fascism do they illuminate? What lessons can we draw
 from them?
 Your responses will receive check marks, indicating whether they did (or did not) fulfill
 expectations. To receive full credit for this assignment, each response should:
 · identify and develop at least one idea or theme,
 · directly connect to the weekly course readings and discussions,
 · demonstrate critical reflection and original thought.
 Your weekly responses must be posted under the “Assignments” tab on Collab by the
 end of the day (11:59 PM EST) on Wednesdays. Collab will not accept late responses.
 Please contact your TA if you experience any problems with this assignment.
 4
 Portfolio: Over the course of the semester, you will write ten weekly responses in all. At
 two points, we will ask you to re-read all the entries you’ve written and compile them
 into a portfolio with a short (2-3 page) introduction. This portfolio will allow you to reflect
 on the evolution of your own thinking and flesh out your understanding of what fascism
 is and does. Your midterm portfolio is due on Wednesday, March 10, at 11:59PM (EST);
 the final version is due on Wednesday, May 5, at 11:59PM (EST). As with all
 assignments for this class, this is not the place for flattery or arguments you don’t
 believe in.
 Midterm Exam: You will have a take-home final exam due on Thursday, April 1, at
 11:59PM (EST). It will consist of short answer and essay questions covering all the
 material we’ve studied by that point in the course.
 Final paper: Your final paper in this course is an opinion piece, or op-ed, that draws on
 everything you’ve learned in this class to make an argument about current events. It is
 due on Thursday, May 13, at 11:59PM (EST). Students who are taking this class on a
 Credit/No Credit basis have the option of taking a final exam instead of the final paper.
 Final Exam (optional): The final exam will include multiple-choice questions,
 identifications, and short essay prompts. Its main purpose is to give credit/no credit
 students the option to conclude the class with an alternative assignment. Students who
 are taking this class for a letter grade are welcome to take the final exam, but they must
 still submit a final paper. If you choose to complete both a final paper and a final exam,
 the average of those two grades will account for 25% of the total.
 Extra Credit: There will be several opportunities to earn extra credit over the course of
 the semester, by attending (virtual) events or watching extra films and lectures - and
 then writing brief responses to them. Stay tuned for more information. You can improve
 your final grade by at most three percent (3%) through three extra credits (1% for each
 extra credit activity), i.e. B → B+ or B+ → A-. To receive the maximum extra credit of
 three percent (3%), you need to hand in three individual short assignments.
 Rules and Policies
 Grading Policy: Your written work will be assessed for clarity, originality, organization,
 and the effective use of evidence from the readings, films, lectures and discussions. The
 penalty for late papers is 1/3 of a letter grade for each 24 hours the work is overdue.
 Late weekly responses will not be accepted without a valid excuse, but they can be
 included in your learning portfolio for partial credit. Exceptions will be granted on the
 grounds of documented illness or personal emergency.
 If you are concerned about meeting any of the deadlines, please notify us well ahead of
 time or as soon as you can. You will receive more information on all assignments as we
 get closer to their due dates.
 Academic Integrity: We trust that all work turned in for this class was composed
 exclusively for this class, and that all wording and ideas presented in any written work
 5
 are your own. Always cite any sources and resources you use and be sure to use
 bibliographic citations. Plagiarism is a serious academic offence. Definitions of what it is
 and how to avoid it can be found at: https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/c.php?
 g=535505&p=3663691.
 When collaborating with other students, do not copy their answers. Always acknowledge
 the individuals you consulted to complete an assignment and detail the nature of their
 input. If you have a question about what is or is not permitted on an assignment, you
 should clarify your question with your instructors prior to doing the work.
 The Bylaws of the Honor Committee define an Honor offense as “a Significant Act of
 Lying, Cheating or Stealing, which Act is committed with Knowledge.” By enrolling into
 this class, you pledge to adhere to UVa’s Honor Code. If you believe you may have
 committed an Honor Offense, you may wish to file a Conscientious Retraction (“CR”) by
 calling the Honor Offices at (434) 924-7602. For your retraction to be considered valid, it
 must, among other things, be filed with the Honor Committee before you are aware that
 the act in question has come under suspicion by anyone. More information about UVa’s
 Honor Code can be found at: https://honor.virginia.edu/.
 Copyright: You may not record, download, alter, and/or distribute class lectures, lecture
 slides, or any other element of this class. We will consider violations of this policy a
 “significant act of stealing” and thus an honor offence. Violations of these terms may
 also be subject to disciplinary action under the University’s Standards of Conduct; for
 details, see https://ujc.virginia.edu/.
 Your Safety and Wellbeing
 We are living through the greatest public health emergency this country has seen in
 over a century. Please stay safe and do your part to slow the rate of transmission. This
 involves complying with all state and local regulations; following university policies; and
 being courteous, considerate, and compassionate towards others.
 It also means that little about this semester will be “normal.” Learning online is still a
 fairly new experience for all of us, and it will require some trial and error. Lecture
 formats, readings, and even assignments may all change as we go along; we’ll give you
 as much notice as we can, and hope that you’ll bear with us. We also ask for your
 feedback: what’s working, what’s not, and what we can do better. Feel free to email us,
 or use the Anonymous Feedback tab on Collab.
 We recognize that this semester brings new challenges and stresses. Here are a
 number of ways to get help:
 Instructor Support: Feel free to schedule individual Zoom or Skype sessions with us to
 discuss drafts, ideas, and our comments on your work. We also understand that
 personal circumstances or unforeseen events can interfere with your academic
 responsibilities. We can meet during office hours or by appointment to discuss any
 6
 aspect of the course, difficulties you may be experiencing, or suggestions for making
 the course more accessible.
 The Writing Center offers online appointments in non-synchronous mode. Good writers
 know that another pair of eyes on their work is always helpful.
 The Student Disability Access Center offers a range of remote services including
 assessments, consultations, and support with accommodations. We always make
 accommodations for students with documented disabilities. Students should notify us
 and the SDAC of disability-related needs.
 UVA libraries feature many helpful staff members and librarians who can help you with
 your research. One name to keep in mind is research librarian for History, Politics, and Religious Studies. 
 knows everything about the library’s resources, both on paper and online. Do not
 hesitate to contact him or his colleagues; they’re eager to hear from you!
 The Office of the Dean of Students provides a list of resources that can help if you are
 experiencing mental health, housing, safety, or food insecurity issues.
 If you or someone you know has experienced or witnessed incidents of bias, hazing, or
 sexual or gender-based violence, go to https://justreportit.virginia.edu/ to report such
 behaviors. Please note that your instructors are “responsible employees,” which means
 that they are required to report issues of violence to the University.
 Confidential employees are available if you want to discuss an issue related to violence
 in depth but want it to remain confidential.

HIUS 3232: The US South in the Twentieth Century

Spring 2015

Tell about the South.  What's it like there.  What do they do there. Why do they live there. Why do they live at all.

                                                William Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom (1936)

 

            This course examines the broad history of the American South in the twentieth century, with special emphasis on racial oppression and violence, the creation of segregation, class and gender relations within the region, the role of evangelical Christianity, the cultural and economic interdependence of black and white southerners, and the Civil Right Movement and its aftermath.  It explores the idea of the global South by comparing the region to the rest of the US and placing this relationship in a transnational frame.  It also models how historians use primary historical documents, including visual and audio as well as textual sources, to think critically about the past. 

               This course meets for lecture twice a week and for discussion once a week.  Each lecture will start with a primary document of the day, which will range from photographs, songs, and film clips to laws, newspaper editorials, and artifacts. We will begin with an analysis of what this document tells us about southern history.  Please complete the readings and/or viewings before your discussion section meets.

Teaching Assistants:  Your teaching assistants are Jonathan Cohen and Joey Thompson, both PhD students in the department of history.  Jonathan did his undergraduate work at McGill University and is interested in twentieth century US history, working-class culture, the political economy, race, Jewish Studies, and Bruce Springsteen, probably not in that order.  Joey did his undergraduate work at the University of Alabama and an MA in Southern Studies at the Center for the Study of Southern Culture.  He is interested in twentieth century US history, the South, and vernacular and popular music, probably not in that order either.  They will provide you with information about policies for their discussion sections.

 

Office Hours:

Hale: Nau 238 M, W 2-3:30

Cohen: Tuesdays, 10-11am in Nau 396, Wednesdays, 2-3pm in the Alderman lobby

Thompson: 10:30-12:30 at the Greenberry's in Alderman

 

Course Requirements: 

Midterm (25%)

Reading response papers (20%)

Final exam (30%)

Class participation (25%)

 

Reading Response Papers:   Students in this course are required to attend their discussion sections each week with a one page, single-spaced, printed response to the questions provided below.  Your teaching assistant will take up this response 9 unannounced times during the semester.  The grades for 8 of these papers will be combined into one score that counts 20% of your final grade.  Please draw your answers from the readings and viewings, rather than the lectures (there will of course be overlap but the purpose of the responses is to make you think about the readings and other materials).   Use specific references where possible, but no footnotes or citations are required.

 

Class participation includes attendance at lectures; participation in sections; and attendance at an MLK celebration event and two other campus lecture to be approved by your TA.

 

Class Policies:

HIUS 3232: The US South in the Twentieth Century

Tell about the South.  What's it like there.  What do they do there. Why do they live there. Why do they live at all

                                                                                                               William Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom (1936)

            This course examines the broad history of the US South in the twentieth century, with special emphasis on racial oppression and violence, the creation of segregation, class and gender relations within the region, the role of evangelical Christianity, the cultural and economic interdependence of black and white southerners, and the Civil Right Movement and its aftermath.  It explores the idea of the global South by comparing the region to the rest of the US and placing this relationship in a transnational frame.  It also models how historians use primary historical documents, including visual and audio as well as textual sources, to think critically about the past.

HIUS 3232: The US South in the Twentieth Century

Spring 2015

Tell about the South.  What's it like there.  What do they do there. Why do they live there. Why do they live at all.

                                                William Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom (1936)

 

            This course examines the broad history of the American South in the twentieth century, with special emphasis on racial oppression and violence, the creation of segregation, class and gender relations within the region, the role of evangelical Christianity, the cultural and economic interdependence of black and white southerners, and the Civil Right Movement and its aftermath.  It explores the idea of the global South by comparing the region to the rest of the US and placing this relationship in a transnational frame.  It also models how historians use primary historical documents, including visual and audio as well as textual sources, to think critically about the past. 

               This course meets for lecture twice a week and for discussion once a week.  Each lecture will start with a primary document of the day, which will range from photographs, songs, and film clips to laws, newspaper editorials, and artifacts. We will begin with an analysis of what this document tells us about southern history.  Please complete the readings and/or viewings before your discussion section meets.

Teaching Assistants:  Your teaching assistants are Jonathan Cohen and Joey Thompson, both PhD students in the department of history.  Jonathan did his undergraduate work at McGill University and is interested in twentieth century US history, working-class culture, the political economy, race, Jewish Studies, and Bruce Springsteen, probably not in that order.  Joey did his undergraduate work at the University of Alabama and an MA in Southern Studies at the Center for the Study of Southern Culture.  He is interested in twentieth century US history, the South, and vernacular and popular music, probably not in that order either.  They will provide you with information about policies for their discussion sections.

 


 

Course Requirements: 

Midterm (25%)

Reading response papers (20%)

Final exam (30%)

Class participation (25%)

 

Reading Response Papers:   Students in this course are required to attend their discussion sections each week with a one page, single-spaced, printed response to the questions provided below.  Your teaching assistant will take up this response 9 unannounced times during the semester.  The grades for 8 of these papers will be combined into one score that counts 20% of your final grade.  Please draw your answers from the readings and viewings, rather than the lectures (there will of course be overlap but the purpose of the responses is to make you think about the readings and other materials).   Use specific references where possible, but no footnotes or citations are required.

 

Class participation includes attendance at lectures; participation in sections; and attendance at an MLK celebration event and two other campus lecture to be approved by your TA.

 

Class Policies:  

Cell phones, tablets, and computers are not allowed in the lecture or discussion sections of this course.  Students using these devices in class will be asked to leave the lecture hall.

HIUS 3232: The US South in the Twentieth Century

Spring 2015

Tell about the South.  What's it like there.  What do they do there. Why do they live there. Why do they live at all.

                                                William Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom (1936)

 

            This course examines the broad history of the American South in the twentieth century, with special emphasis on racial oppression and violence, the creation of segregation, class and gender relations within the region, the role of evangelical Christianity, the cultural and economic interdependence of black and white southerners, and the Civil Right Movement and its aftermath.  It explores the idea of the global South by comparing the region to the rest of the US and placing this relationship in a transnational frame.  It also models how historians use primary historical documents, including visual and audio as well as textual sources, to think critically about the past. 

               This course meets for lecture twice a week and for discussion once a week.  Each lecture will start with a primary document of the day, which will range from photographs, songs, and film clips to laws, newspaper editorials, and artifacts. We will begin with an analysis of what this document tells us about southern history.  Please complete the readings and/or viewings before your discussion section meets.

Teaching Assistants:  Your teaching assistants are Jonathan Cohen and Joey Thompson, both PhD students in the department of history.  Jonathan did his undergraduate work at McGill University and is interested in twentieth century US history, working-class culture, the political economy, race, Jewish Studies, and Bruce Springsteen, probably not in that order.  Joey did his undergraduate work at the University of Alabama and an MA in Southern Studies at the Center for the Study of Southern Culture.  He is interested in twentieth century US history, the South, and vernacular and popular music, probably not in that order either.  They will provide you with information about policies for their discussion sections.

 


 

Course Requirements: 

Midterm (25%)

Reading response papers (20%)

Final exam (30%)

Class participation (25%)

 

Reading Response Papers:   Students in this course are required to attend their discussion sections each week with a one page, single-spaced, printed response to the questions provided below.  Your teaching assistant will take up this response 9 unannounced times during the semester.  The grades for 8 of these papers will be combined into one score that counts 20% of your final grade.  Please draw your answers from the readings and viewings, rather than the lectures (there will of course be overlap but the purpose of the responses is to make you think about the readings and other materials).   Use specific references where possible, but no footnotes or citations are required.

 

Class participation includes attendance at lectures; participation in sections; and attendance at an MLK celebration event and two other campus lecture to be approved by your TA.

 

Class Policies:  

Cell phones, tablets, and computers are not allowed in the lecture or discussion sections of this course.  Students using these devices in class will be asked to leave the lecture hall.  If you have an emergency (a hospitalized family, for example) that requires you to leave your phone on vibrate, please clear this with the TA or the professor before class. 

As your professor, I am committed to making UVA a safe space for all students.  If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here who can help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for its students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially over the phone, call Madison House's HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.  You may also speak to me in office hours or make an appointment.

If you or someone you know is struggling with gender, sexual, or domestic violence, there are many community and University of Virginia resources available.

            This course examines the broad history of the US South in the twentieth century, with special emphasis on racial oppression and violence, the creation of segregation, class and gender relations within the region, the role of evangelical Christianity, the cultural and economic interdependence of black and white southerners, and the Civil Right Movement and its aftermath.  It explores the idea of the global South by comparing the region to the rest of the US and placing this relationship in a transnational frame.  It also models how historians use primary historical documents, including visual and audio as well as textual sources, to think critically about the past.

ABOUT THE COURSE
The University of Virginia, founded in 1819, began with a rich history of writing and writers; that tradition
continues today. But with so many different writing activities taking place across Grounds and across time, we may
not fully appreciate what all this culture means.
In this course, you will both research and contribute to the culture of writing at UVA. You’ll have a chance to read
the (mostly unpublished) writing of past students and faculty, to see where we’ve come from.
You’ll investigate current writing activities across Grounds, helping put together a puzzle that reveals what and how
we’re writing today. And finally, you’ll create your own original writing to add to our university archives, making
your mark for future generations to read. Through this hands-on literary adventure, you will gain a holistic sense of
UVA's rich writing culture and your place, as well.
Questions to Ask:
● What do texts tell us about a community or institution?
(And of course, what do they NOT tell us?)
● How do we read texts in context? What does studying the past tell us about the present, and vice versa?
● What is the “culture of writing” at UVA? What can we really articulate about UVA’s identity more generally?
● What does it mean to be a transitory part of a stable place?
● What do YOU want to add to the history and culture of writing at UVA?
By the end of this course, you should be able to:
● Conduct basic archival and qualitative field research.
● Read and represent primary sources in both exhibit form and essays.
● Prepare materials for digital exhibit and archival preservation.
● Speak with substance regarding the history and culture of writing at UVA.
Required Materials
● Mr. Jefferson’s Telescope: A History of the University of Virginia in One Hundred Objects, by Brendan Wolfe
(ISBN: 978-0813940106)
● Access to a reasonable camera, photo editing software, and word processor. (For most of you, your
smartphone, Google Docs, and possibly free online tools will be easy to work with. If you have any
concerns about resources, please let me know, and we’ll work out alternatives.)

Office Hours and Contact Information
Please feel free to drop by during my office hours or to make an appointment for other times. For short notes, the
best way to reach me is by text message. I check these regularly during business hours (M-F, 9-5) and can usually
respond within a few hours. For longer communications, I also check email regularly during business hours and will
do my best to respond to your emails within 24 hours.
I will release course announcements/updates via Collab. You will need to configure your Collab account to make
sure you receive announcements quickly.
UVA Writing Center
The UVA Writing Center is a writing resource staffed by graduate and undergraduate student tutors and available to
all UVA students. They DO have limited available hours over the summer. Tutors work one on one with students
in 50-minute appointments and can help with drafting, revision, argument structure, and other special concerns. Do
note that although they can offer help at every stage of the writing process, they do not offer proofreading or
editing services. Their concern is not to “clean up” your specific assignment, but to help you become a better writer
overall. Register online for sessions at https://virginia.mywconline.com.
COURSE POLICIES
Attendance
Attendance and active participation is required throughout the term. You will need to come to class prepared
(having completed all reading/writing assignments in advance) and ready to engage the day’s activities, which may
be solo or collaborative.
In most cases, the standard attendance policy will apply as follows:
● Any student is allowed three class absences for any reason.
o You should use these for typical illness or personal leave.
● If you miss more than 2 class periods without contacting me, I may refer you to the Office of the Dean of
Students out of concern for your safety.
● If you miss more than 6 class periods, I will recommend that you withdraw; otherwise, you will fail the class.
*Exceptions:
If you have outstanding circumstances that you believe warrants additional attendance accommodations, please see
me as early as possible to discuss whether those are appropriate. These usually arise connected to the following:
o technology difficulties
o pandemic-induced quarantine (asynchronous meeting options will be available in these cases)
o pandemic-induced extra home responsibilities
o religious observances
o medical or personal crises for you or a member of your immediate family
**NOTE: I do not need or accept medical notes; please do not provide them.
Late Work
Work will be due at the beginning of class and will be considered late thereafter. If you know you will be missing a
class, you must submit the assignment ahead of time to receive credit. During collaborative projects, some late work
will be unusable and will therefore receive a grade of “zero.” In most other situations, extensions are available and
late penalties will apply (a one-time, flat penalty of 10%). You must arrange extensions PRIOR to the assignment
due date in order to avoid late penalties.
Class Conduct
Our classroom is a place for the free exchange of ideas in an environment of mutual respect. Students whose
behavior distracts or disrespects others will be asked to leave and will be counted absent. 
ENWR 2520-002 (Spring 2022) syllabus • Heidi Nobles • Page 3 of 5
Revisions on Major Assignments
You are encouraged to revise major essay assignments to improve your grades. FAQs:
• What can I revise?
o On Essays 1 and 2, you will receive a grade and feedback on your final submission, and you may opt
to revise further.
o Your Unit 3 assignment is a presentation; you will not be able to revise.
o Your Unit 4 assignment is the most self-directed. You will have about a month to draft and revise,
using feedback from a Whole Class Workshop. At any time in the unit, you may bring a draft to my
office for a grade estimate. However, once the final draft is due (last day of class), the grade will be
final.
• How do I revise for a regrade?
o You must meet with me live (in person or on Zoom) to request a regrade. You cannot email
submissions for regrade requests. Most meetings last about 10 minutes.
o You should bring both the original and a revised draft to the regrade meeting. I’ll read and regrade
during our time together.
o You ARE welcome to schedule an additional meeting, if you’d like to discuss the written feedback
before revising.
• When is the final day to meet with you for regrade revisions?
o All grades will be final as of 5 p.m. on the last day of class. Note that I may not have time to meet
on that day if you wait until the last minute, so you should schedule meetings well in advance.
Transparency Practices
Most student work created in this course will be shared in open Drive folders, easily accessible to the rest of the
class. We practice active collaboration throughout the term, reading and providing input on drafts in progress.
• If you wish to submit something without others’ having access, please restrict sharing to only me, and email
me so I know to retain the restricted privacy settings.
• Any grades will be restricted to individual students only.
Disclosure Statement:
Please be advised that I, as with most UVA employees, am considered a “responsible employee”—that is, if you
disclose to me information that falls under Title IX, I am legally required to report that information. Primarily, this
means I have to report harassment and interpersonal violence; I am also responsible for reporting many forms of
self-harm and criminal activity. If you still want to talk with me, I am happy to be a resource, but if you want to talk
to someone who does not have the same obligation to share your information, I can also refer you to others who are
designated “confidential employees.” You can find a list of these confidential resources at
https://eocr.virginia.edu/chart-confidential-resources.
Accommodations Statement:
It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the
format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential
options. I am happy to consider creative solutions as long as they do not compromise the intent of the assessment
or learning activity. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with the
Student Disability Access Center (SDAC), to request an official accommodation. You can find more information
about SDAC, including how to apply online, through their website at sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu. If you have
already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please make sure to send me your accommodation
letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

Academic Misconduct:
I trust every student in this course to fully comply with all of the provisions of the University’s Honor Code. By
enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the Honor System of the University of Virginia, as
well as the following policies specific to this course:
Collaboration is an essential part of this course and a key component of any writing activity. That said:
● You should be transparent about those whose assistance has contributed to your work (peer reviewers, outside
readers, proofreaders, etc.). You may disclose these names in footnotes or a cover note, as appropriate.
● You must fully cite all outside sources in your work.
● If you submit an assignment that properly discloses outside sources but does not demonstrate adequate
independent work, you will be given an opportunity to revise for regrading.
● If you submit an assignment in which you fail to acknowledge outside sources or in which you include little to
no original work (i.e. in which you copied someone else’s work and presented it as your own), you will not be
given the opportunity to revise. Such suspected violations will be forwarded to the Honor Committee, and you
may, at my discretion, receive an immediate zero on that assignment regardless of any action taken by the
Honor Committee.
ENWR 2520-002 (Spring 2022) syllabus • Heidi Nobles • Page 5 of 5
Assignments and Grading
1) Short Writing Assignments & Peer Feedback (20%)
Throughout the course, you will have short writing assignments (mostly Forum posts, though there may be
additional exercises) and you will provide important feedback to your peers on miscellaneous work in
progress, ranging from developmental notes to proofreading.
2) Major Assignments (70%)
● Unit One: Essay #1 [Text & Culture at UVA (Round One)] (15%)
● Unit Two: Archival Exhibit+Essay #2 [Analysis & Reflection: Historical UVA] (20%)
● Unit Three: Contemporary Exhibit+Group Presentations [Analysis & Reflection: UVA Today] (20%)
● Unit Four: Original Contribution to the Archives (15%)
3) Final Exam (10%)
For your final exam, you will give a short presentation on the portfolio of work you compiled this term and
reflections on a final prompt. These presentations will place during our scheduled exam period.
Grading Rubrics
Specific rubrics will vary based on assignment and will be handed out with the assignments themselves.
Grading Scale
Coming to class every day and completing assignments is a basic expectation for coursework; simply fulfilling the
minimum requirements of the course warrants an average grade (i.e., C). A higher than average grade will be based
on: 1) the distinctive quality and development of your work; 2) consistently demonstrating critical and creative
thinking in your writing; 3) your ability to guide a piece of writing through various stages of editing and revision,
and to ultimately hone the ability to write polished prose on deadline; and 4) a willingness to take risks by exploring
new subjects, genres, and techniques. Below is a breakdown of how final grades are calculated; as we move into the
term, you will receive more detailed descriptions and we’ll talk more about how your writing is evaluated. I grade on
a 100-point scale, as illustrated below.
Letter

class, you must submit the assignment ahead of time to receive credit. During collaborative projects, some late work
will be unusable and will therefore receive a grade of “zero.” In most other situations, extensions are available and
late penalties will apply (a one-time, flat penalty of 10%). You must arrange extensions PRIOR to the assignment
due date in order to avoid late penalties.
Class Conduct
Our classroom is a place for the free exchange of ideas in an environment of mutual respect. Students whose
behavior distracts or disrespects others will be asked to leave and will be counted absent.

Revisions on Major Assignments
You are encouraged to revise major essay assignments to improve your grades. FAQs:
• What can I revise?
o On Essays 1 and 2, you will receive a grade and feedback on your final submission, and you may opt
to revise further.
o Your Unit 3 assignment is a presentation; you will not be able to revise.
o Your Unit 4 assignment is the most self-directed. You will have about a month to draft and revise,
using feedback from a Whole Class Workshop. At any time in the unit, you may bring a draft to my
office for a grade estimate. However, once the final draft is due (last day of class), the grade will be
final.
• How do I revise for a regrade?
o You must meet with me live (in person or on Zoom) to request a regrade. You cannot email
submissions for regrade requests. Most meetings last about 10 minutes.
o You should bring both the original and a revised draft to the regrade meeting. I’ll read and regrade
during our time together.
o You ARE welcome to schedule an additional meeting, if you’d like to discuss the written feedback
before revising.
• When is the final day to meet with you for regrade revisions?
o All grades will be final as of 5 p.m. on the last day of class. Note that I may not have time to meet
on that day if you wait until the last minute, so you should schedule meetings well in advance.
Transparency Practices
Most student work created in this course will be shared in open Drive folders, easily accessible to the rest of the
class. We practice active collaboration throughout the term, reading and providing input on drafts in progress.
• If you wish to submit something without others’ having access, please restrict sharing to only me, and email
me so I know to retain the restricted privacy settings.
• Any grades will be restricted to individual students only.
Disclosure Statement:
Please be advised that I, as with most UVA employees, am considered a “responsible employee”—that is, if you
disclose to me information that falls under Title IX, I am legally required to report that information. Primarily, this
means I have to report harassment and interpersonal violence; I am also responsible for reporting many forms of
self-harm and criminal activity. If you still want to talk with me, I am happy to be a resource, but if you want to talk
to someone who does not have the same obligation to share your information, I can also refer you to others who are
designated “confidential employees.” You can find a list of these confidential resources at
https://eocr.virginia.edu/chart-confidential-resources.
Accommodations Statement:
It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the
format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential
options. I am happy to consider creative solutions as long as they do not compromise the intent of the assessment
or learning activity. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with the
Student Disability Access Center (SDAC), to request an official accommodation. You can find more information
about SDAC, including how to apply online, through their website at sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu. If you have
already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please make sure to send me your accommodation
letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

Academic Misconduct:
I trust every student in this course to fully comply with all of the provisions of the University’s Honor Code. By
enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the Honor System of the University of Virginia, as
well as the following policies specific to this course:
Collaboration is an essential part of this course and a key component of any writing activity. That said:
● You should be transparent about those whose assistance has contributed to your work (peer reviewers, outside
readers, proofreaders, etc.). You may disclose these names in footnotes or a cover note, as appropriate.
● You must fully cite all outside sources in your work.
● If you submit an assignment that properly discloses outside sources but does not demonstrate adequate
independent work, you will be given an opportunity to revise for regrading.
● If you submit an assignment in which you fail to acknowledge outside sources or in which you include little to
no original work (i.e. in which you copied someone else’s work and presented it as your own), you will not be
given the opportunity to revise. Such suspected violations will be forwarded to the Honor Committee, and you
may, at my discretion, receive an immediate zero on that assignment regardless of any action taken by the
Honor Committee.

Assignments and Grading
1) Short Writing Assignments & Peer Feedback (20%)

Grading Rubrics
Specific rubrics will vary based on assignment and will be handed out with the assignments themselves.
Grading Scale
Coming to class every day and completing assignments is a basic expectation for coursework; simply fulfilling the
minimum requirements of the course warrants an average grade (i.e., C). A higher than average grade will be based
on: 1) the distinctive quality and development of your work; 2) consistently demonstrating critical and creative
thinking in your writing; 3) your ability to guide a piece of writing through various stages of editing and revision,
and to ultimately hone the ability to write polished prose on deadline; and 4) a willingness to take risks by exploring
new subjects, genres, and techniques. Below is a breakdown of how final grades are calculated; as we move into the
term, you will receive more detailed descriptions and we’ll talk more about how your writing is evaluated. I grade on
a 100-point scale, as illustrated below.

ABOUT THE COURSE
The University of Virginia, founded in 1819, began with a rich history of writing and writers; that tradition
continues today. But with so many different writing activities taking place across Grounds and across time, we may
not fully appreciate what all this culture means.
In this course, you will both research and contribute to the culture of writing at UVA. You’ll have a chance to read
the (mostly unpublished) writing of past students and faculty, to see where we’ve come from.
You’ll investigate current writing activities across Grounds, helping put together a puzzle that reveals what and how
we’re writing today. And finally, you’ll create your own original writing to add to our university archives, making
your mark for future generations to read. Through this hands-on literary adventure, you will gain a holistic sense of
UVA's rich writing culture and your place, as well.
Questions to Ask:
● What do texts tell us about a community or institution?
(And of course, what do they NOT tell us?)
● How do we read texts in context? What does studying the past tell us about the present, and vice versa?
● What is the “culture of writing” at UVA? What can we really articulate about UVA’s identity more generally?
● What does it mean to be a transitory part of a stable place?
● What do YOU want to add to the history and culture of writing at UVA?
By the end of this course, you should be able to:
● Conduct basic archival and qualitative field research.
● Read and represent primary sources in both exhibit form and essays.
● Prepare materials for digital exhibit and archival preservation.
● Speak with substance regarding the history and culture of writing at UVA.
Required Materials
● Mr. Jefferson’s Telescope: A History of the University of Virginia in One Hundred Objects, by Brendan Wolfe
(ISBN: 978-0813940106)
● Access to a reasonable camera, photo editing software, and word processor. (For most of you, your
smartphone, Google Docs, and possibly free online tools will be easy to work with. If you have any
concerns about resources, please let me know, and we’ll work out alternatives.)

Office Hours and Contact Information
Please feel free to drop by during my office hours or to make an appointment for other times. For short notes, the
best way to reach me is by text message. I check these regularly during business hours (M-F, 9-5) and can usually
respond within a few hours. For longer communications, I also check email regularly during business hours and will
do my best to respond to your emails within 24 hours.
I will release course announcements/updates via Collab. You will need to configure your Collab account to make
sure you receive announcements quickly.
UVA Writing Center
The UVA Writing Center is a writing resource staffed by graduate and undergraduate student tutors and available to
all UVA students. They DO have limited available hours over the summer. Tutors work one on one with students
in 50-minute appointments and can help with drafting, revision, argument structure, and other special concerns. Do
note that although they can offer help at every stage of the writing process, they do not offer proofreading or
editing services. Their concern is not to “clean up” your specific assignment, but to help you become a better writer
overall. Register online for sessions at https://virginia.mywconline.com.
COURSE POLICIES
Attendance
Attendance and active participation is required throughout the term. You will need to come to class prepared
(having completed all reading/writing assignments in advance) and ready to engage the day’s activities, which may
be solo or collaborative.
In most cases, the standard attendance policy will apply as follows:
● Any student is allowed three class absences for any reason.
o You should use these for typical illness or personal leave.
● If you miss more than 2 class periods without contacting me, I may refer you to the Office of the Dean of
Students out of concern for your safety.
● If you miss more than 6 class periods, I will recommend that you withdraw; otherwise, you will fail the class.
*Exceptions:
If you have outstanding circumstances that you believe warrants additional attendance accommodations, please see
me as early as possible to discuss whether those are appropriate. These usually arise connected to the following:
o technology difficulties
o pandemic-induced quarantine (asynchronous meeting options will be available in these cases)
o pandemic-induced extra home responsibilities
o religious observances
o medical or personal crises for you or a member of your immediate family
**NOTE: I do not need or accept medical notes; please do not provide them.
Late Work
Work will be due at the beginning of class and will be considered late thereafter. If you know you will be missing a
class, you must submit the assignment ahead of time to receive credit. During collaborative projects, some late work
will be unusable and will therefore receive a grade of “zero.” In most other situations, extensions are available and
late penalties will apply (a one-time, flat penalty of 10%). You must arrange extensions PRIOR to the assignment
due date in order to avoid late penalties.
Class Conduct
Our classroom is a place for the free exchange of ideas in an environment of mutual respect. Students whose
behavior distracts or disrespects others will be asked to leave and will be counted absent.

Textbook: (Required) Mark R. Rosenzweig, Arnold L. Leiman, & S. Marc Breedlove, (1999). Biological Psychology:
An Introduction to Behavioral, Cognitive, and Clinical Neuroscience (4
th ed.). Sinauer Associates,
Inc., Publishers, Sunderland, Massachusetts.
Course Objectives:
This course will introduce the student to the basic concepts, principles, and theories of biological correlates of behavior. The
student should emerge from this class with a basic understanding in the following areas:
1. Students should emerge with a basic concept of functional neuroanatomy and understand how the nervous system impacts
behavior.
2. Students should have a basic knowledge and understanding of neurophysiology.
3. Students should acquire a basic understanding of the impact of psychopharmacology and neuroendrocrinology and how they
impact behavior.
4. Students should gain a basic understanding of modality-specific sensory and perceptual processing.
5. Students should gain a perspective of neurophysiological integration with regulation of behavior, and mental disorders.
6. Students should gain an introductory knowledge and understanding of the area of neuropsychology and the emerging field of
cognitive neuroscience.
7. Students should gain an introductory knowledge of the biological and neural mechanisms of learning.
Class Communications:
The preferred method of communications for this course is via email. I will answer questions, make class
announcements which may include changes in the class requirements and provide feedback via email so it is important
that you maintain a current email address and frequently check the mailbox for that address. Bad email addresses and
full mailboxes create problems for the class messages and prevent you from receiving information. Due to the impact on
the class and the demonstrated lack of personal responsibility these conditions present, I will not normally allow any
credit lost due to bad email addresses or full mailboxes to be made up.
Software: This course assumes a complete installation of a Web browser, a college e-mail account and access to the
Internet. You should be able to do everything required with your IPad that was furnished by UVA WISE, however, if you have a
problem accessing the Internet or software needed to successfully complete this course we will do everything possible to assist you
and ensure that you have what you need.
Internet use: Since this course is online, students will be required to use the Internet to access course content in
Moodle. If you have a problem with Internet access or accessing course content contact me immediately so that we can
investigate possible solutions and assist you in any way we can.
Moodle: The Moodle system will be a key tool in completing this course so I advise you to take time to get familiar with
the content it holds for this course. There will be PowerPoint files with notes for the material to supplement your
textbook, chat rooms and forums for you to participate in course material discussions as well as announcements about
the class. Be sure to check it often.
Discussion Forum and Chat Room evaluation is based on four points:
1. Number of posts on the discussion forum for each Discussion topic. (Are you really involved in the discussion? I am looking for
real activity focused on learning or sharing class related information)
2. How well your posting shows your understanding or efforts to gain understanding of the subject.
3. Your posting provides value to the discussion (basically it is not irrelevant talk – something submitted just to say you did it)
4. Replies to and comments on other students’ postings on the discussion forum that contribute to a better understanding of the
topic or a solution to a problem.
Postings to the discussion forum should be written as you would for a formally submitted paper, not in a texting or
instant messaging style (no capitalization, punctuation, abbreviations, etc.). Your written word has a large impact of
potential employers so let’s practice good writing skills throughout the class. 
Discussion forums are graded as individual assignments and the average of all postings becomes a weighted percentage
of the overall class grade. Remember that any discussion without a post from you will receive a grade of zero and
substantially reduce the credit you receive for class discussions.
Zoom Meetings
Zoom meetings will be scheduled as needed with students that prefer to use Zoom rather than forum or chat rooms.
Exams:
There will be five section exams.
Homework Assignments:
There will be homework assignments, as determined by the instructor, designed to prepare the student for forthcoming exams.
Honor Code:
The Honor Code of The University of Virginia’s College at Wise is fully supported and each student in this class will be treated as
a responsible and honest adult. Violations of the Honor Code will be prosecuted through the Honor Court.
Grading:
Your grade will be determined by your participation online, assignments and the section exams.

Assignments (considered part of participation) 0%

Special Accommodations: ADA: All students with disabilities requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork
from the ADA Coordinator (Faculty Accommodation Notice). It is the student’s responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered. Accommodations for test-taking (e.g.
extended time) should be arranged at least 3 class days before an exam. If you are not registered with the Disability Services,
please do so as soon as possible by contacting the ADA Coordinator (Zehmer Hall, Office 152, 328-0177).
Sexual Misconduct/Harassment Statement: The University of Virginia’s College at Wise is committed to maintaining a respectful,
professional and nondiscriminatory academic, living, and working environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors. This
includes having an environment free from sexual and gender based harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence, stalking,
sexual exploitation, complicity and retaliation. The College reaffirms its commitment to maintain a campus environment
emphasizing the dignity and worth of all members of the college community.

PSYC 2600-100 – F2019 Syllabus 2
Learning Objectives
As a result of taking this class, students will
 Describe how the discipline sees all behavior as a function of the person and the
environment across research area
 Describe how social psychology differentiates itself from other psychological disciplines
 Demonstrate an understanding of research and theory describing how individuals come to
understand themselves, their beliefs and attitudes, and their own behaviors, as well as the
behavior of others
 Identify the different ways individuals influence or attempt to influence one another and
be able to identify the specific factors that increase and/or decrease the likelihood of
successful influence
 Demonstrate an understanding of how research and theory explains the origin and
dynamics of both positive (i.e.; attraction, helping behavior) and negative (i.e.; prejudice,
aggression) social relations
Attendance & Participation
It is expected that you will attend each class meeting. Be aware that material will be
presented in class that is not available in your textbook, material that is fair game for the exams.
If you do miss a class, it is your responsibility to obtain the information presented in the class
you missed.
Final Grading
Students’ grade for the semester will use the following scale cutoffs of the percentage of
points earned in the course that is listed as the default for the College of Arts & Sciences:
A+ = 100% A = 95% A- = 90%
B+ = 87% B = 83% B- = 80%
C+ = 77% C = 73% C- = 70%
D+ = 67% D = 63% D- = 60%
F = < 60%
In calculating your final grade, I will round grades up to the next highest step if applicable (e.g.;
79.45% to 80%; 92.45% to 93%). However, I will not add points beyond rounding so students
can make the next highest letter grade, maintain a scholarship or athletic eligibility, etc. Please do
not ask.
Exams
There will be five exams during the class. The first four combined will be worth 70% of
your final grade, with a cumulative final exam worth 30% of your final grade.
The first four exams will cover only the material presented since the previous exam. The
final exam is cumulative. The exams will consist of multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short
answer questions. Exams will cover text and class material.
Note that all tests must be taken on-line through Collab during class. Details about
how to do this will be given in class. Students are asked not to look at any past tests from this

course to which they might have access. LOOKING AT PAST TESTS IS CONSIDERED AN
HONOR OFFENSE. It is also an honor offense to share information about a test given in this
class with other students. Please note that University policy prohibits students from taking tests
or exams before the scheduled dates
Exam Make-Up
Please take the exam dates on the syllabus into consideration when making travel plans
and appointments for the semester, as exams will not be moved for student convenience.
Missing an exam will result in a score of zero on that exam. However, students can choose which
three exam scores count towards their total grade calculation for the semester. (NOTE: this does
not include the comprehensive final, which will always be counted). Be aware that this
accommodation is the way this class will deal with absences due to personal illness, mishap, etc.
That is, if you have a conflict, don’t ask for a make-up exam so you can “save” your exam drop
for later. That is not the intended use of this policy.
The Dean of Undergraduate Academic Programs has asked that faculty allow for
rescheduling in the case of serious family illness or death, religious obligations, and participation
in NCAA athletic contests. Only the first of these is unexpected; students wishing to reschedule
exams due to athletic or religious obligations should be aware of such conflicts upon receiving
the syllabus and should request rescheduling within the first full week of classes.
It is rare that students will have two or more exam scheduling concerns over the course of
the semester. You will need to speak with me individually if this is the case.
Final Exam
The final will be administered during the assigned final exam time in our regularly
assigned classroom. Given the time of year and pressures to grade, moving the final exam will
not be accommodated unless it meets the College of Arts & Sciences criteria: three or more
exams on two consecutive days. If this describes you, you will need to fill out the Exam
Postponement form found on the College's Forms page (link) and bring it to me to sign, then
submit it to the appropriate College office. Please note that the make-up time will only be
available for students who successfully petition to have their exam postponed through channels –
it’s not an option for you to choose which time best suits you.
Post-Exam Questions
Exams typically take about a week to grade, and will be posted via Collab. Students may
wish to discuss a particular question with myself or the TA(s) to clarify their understanding or to
petition for an equally strong alternative or improved scoring. In dealing with these questions,
this class will follow the 24/7 Rule:
 You MUST wait 24 hours from the return of the exam to ask a question, and
 You have 7 days to pose your question.
Requests to change marks on previous exams received after 7 days will not be considered. Please
see the document The 24/7 Rule & Post-Exam Questions in the Resources tab for more details.
Please note that if the TA(s) or I receive an email prior to the end of the 24-hour
moratorium, we will simply delete it. Additionally, please be aware that prior to, during, or after
class in the classroom is not an appropriate place to be discussing questions.

Extra Credit: i>Clicker Quizzes
Beginning September 11th, I will put up a question in the PowerPoint presentation based
on course material that we have covered or that you were assigned to read for that day. Each
question is worth one extra credit point1
. The extra credit will figure in at the end of class as an
adjustment to your final grade. Extra credit can add no more than 1% to your final grade in the
class. This is meant to help with edge cases. As these are extra credit points, there will be no
opportunity to make up the questions. Be aware that there will be no extra credit given in the
course other than the i>Clicker quizzes.
N.B.: To earn clicker credits you MUST register AFTER you have used the clicker in
class. To do so:
1) After using the i>Clicker in class, go to the Collab page for the course
2) Click on i>Clicker
3) Enter your ID number from your i>Clicker in the text window
4) Click Register
University Email Policy
Students are expected to activate and then check their official UVa email addresses on a
frequent and consistent basis to remain informed of University communications, as certain
communications may be time sensitive. Students who fail to check their email on a regular basis
are responsible for any resulting consequences.
University of Virginia Honor System
All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System of the University of
Virginia. None of the exams in this course permit collaboration or any form of outside assistance.
Exams will require students to check a box indicating their acceptance of the Honor System, and
checking said box will be equivalent to writing the honor pledge on the exam. For more
information please visit http://www.virginia.edu/honor/.
Special Needs
It is the policy of the University of Virginia to accommodate students with disabilities in
accordance with federal and state laws. Any student with a disability who needs accommodation
(e.g., in arrangements for seating, extended time for examinations, or note-taking, etc.), should
contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) and provide them with appropriate medical
or psychological documentation of his/her condition. Once accommodations are approved, it is
the student’s responsibility to follow up with the instructor about logistics and implementation of
accommodations.
If students have difficulty accessing any part of the course materials or activities for this
class, they should contact the instructor immediately. Accommodations for test taking should be
arranged at least 14 business days in advance of the date of the test(s). Students with disabilities
are encouraged to contact SDAC: 434-243-5180/Voice, 434-465-6579/Video Phone, 434-243-
1 Please note that the honor code applies to these clicker questions just as much as it applies to your exams; you may not use
another student’s clicker, share your answer or copy someone else’s, or try to find questions used in previous sections of PSYC
2600.

Participant Pool Research Requirement:
As a supplement to lecture, you are required to participate in 6 hours of experimental
research studies, or to complete an equivalent alternate assignment, which involves reviewing six
empirical articles. If you have already done this in a different 1000 or 2000-level Psychology
course at UVA, then you do not need to complete this requirement again. ALL STUDENTS
(even if you think you already completed the requirement) must read the document entitled
“Accessing the Participant Pool.docx,” which can be found in the Participant Pool folder in the
Resources section of the course Collab page. This document provides detailed instructions on
how to complete the requirement and what to do if you already completed the requirement in a
previous semester. You may begin the requirement on September 2nd. Three of the hours must be
completed by October 25th, and the remaining three must be completed by midnight on the last
day of classes, December 6th
.
If you fail to complete the research requirement, your final grade will be lowered by one
step (e.g., B- will become C+). Please direct all questions about the Participant Pool requirement
to ppool@virginia.edu.
Syllabus Flexibility
The topics, pages, and dates listed on the following syllabus page are to be considered
tentative – circumstances may be such that an alteration is necessary. If this occurs, I will notify
you as to how this will affect the material on which you will be tested. Be aware that in many
cases, I’ll still hold you responsible for the reading, even if I never get to lecture on the material.

in NCAA athletic contests. Only the first of these is unexpected; students wishing to reschedule
exams due to athletic or religious obligations should be aware of such conflicts upon receiving
the syllabus and should request rescheduling within the first full week of classes.
It is rare that students will have two or more exam scheduling concerns over the course of
the semester. You will need to speak with me individually if this is the case.
Final Exam
The final will be administered during the assigned final exam time in our regularly
assigned classroom. Given the time of year and pressures to grade, moving the final exam will
not be accommodated unless it meets the College of Arts & Sciences criteria: three or more
exams on two consecutive days. If this describes you, you will need to fill out the Exam
Postponement form found on the College's Forms page (link) and bring it to me to sign, then
submit it to the appropriate College office. Please note that the make-up time will only be
available for students who successfully petition to have their exam postponed through channels –
it’s not an option for you to choose which time best suits you.
Post-Exam Questions
Exams typically take about a week to grade, and will be posted via Collab. Students may
wish to discuss a particular question with myself or the TA(s) to clarify their understanding or to
petition for an equally strong alternative or improved scoring. In dealing with these questions,
this class will follow the 24/7 Rule:
 You MUST wait 24 hours from the return of the exam to ask a question, and
 You have 7 days to pose your question.
Requests to change marks on previous exams received after 7 days will not be considered. Please
see the document The 24/7 Rule & Post-Exam Questions in the Resources tab for more details.
Please note that if the TA(s) or I receive an email prior to the end of the 24-hour
moratorium, we will simply delete it. Additionally, please be aware that prior to, during, or after
class in the classroom is not an appropriate place to be discussing questions.

Extra Credit: i>Clicker Quizzes
Beginning September 11th, I will put up a question in the PowerPoint presentation based
on course material that we have covered or that you were assigned to read for that day. Each
question is worth one extra credit point1
. The extra credit will figure in at the end of class as an
adjustment to your final grade. Extra credit can add no more than 1% to your final grade in the
class. This is meant to help with edge cases. As these are extra credit points, there will be no
opportunity to make up the questions. Be aware that there will be no extra credit given in the
course other than the i>Clicker quizzes.
N.B.: To earn clicker credits you MUST register AFTER you have used the clicker in
class. To do so:
1) After using the i>Clicker in class, go to the Collab page for the course
2) Click on i>Clicker
3) Enter your ID number from your i>Clicker in the text window
4) Click Register
University Email Policy
Students are expected to activate and then check their official UVa email addresses on a
frequent and consistent basis to remain informed of University communications, as certain
communications may be time sensitive. Students who fail to check their email on a regular basis
are responsible for any resulting consequences.
University of Virginia Honor System
All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System of the University of
Virginia. None of the exams in this course permit collaboration or any form of outside assistance.

(e.g., in arrangements for seating, extended time for examinations, or note-taking, etc.), should
contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) and provide them with appropriate medical
or psychological documentation of his/her condition. Once accommodations are approved, it is
the student’s responsibility to follow up with the instructor about logistics and implementation of
accommodations.

Participant Pool Research Requirement:
As a supplement to lecture, you are required to participate in 6 hours of experimental
research studies, or to complete an equivalent alternate assignment, which involves reviewing six
empirical articles. If you have already done this in a different 1000 or 2000-level Psychology
course at UVA, then you do not need to complete this requirement again. ALL STUDENTS
(even if you think you already completed the requirement) must read the document entitled
“Accessing the Participant Pool.docx,” which can be found in the Participant Pool folder in the
Resources section of the course Collab page. This document provides detailed instructions on
how to complete the requirement and what to do if you already completed the requirement in a
previous semester. You may begin the requirement on September 2nd. Three of the hours must be
completed by October 25th, and the remaining three must be completed by midnight on the last
day of classes, December 6th
.
If you fail to complete the research requirement, your final grade will be lowered by one
step (e.g., B- will become C+). Please direct all questions about the Participant Pool requirement
to ppool@virginia.edu.
Syllabus Flexibility
The topics, pages, and dates listed on the following syllabus page are to be considered
tentative – circumstances may be such that an alteration is necessary. If this occurs, I will notify
you as to how this will affect the material on which you will be tested. Be aware that in many
cases, I’ll still hold you responsible for the reading, even if I never get to lecture on the material.

Course Description
Surveys major topics in social psychology, including personal perception and social
cognition, attitudes and persuasion, interpersonal influence, interpersonal attraction, and helping
relationships. Considers research theory and applications of social psychology. Three lecture
hours.
Learning Objectives
As a result of taking this class, students will
Describe how the discipline sees all behavior as a function of the person and the
environment across research area
Describe how social psychology differentiates itself from other psychological disciplines
Demonstrate an understanding of research and theory describing how individuals come to
understand themselves, their beliefs and attitudes, and their own behaviors, as well as the
behavior of others
Identify the different ways individuals influence or attempt to influence one another and
be able to identify the specific factors that increase and/or decrease the likelihood of
successful influence
Demonstrate an understanding of how research and theory explains the origin and
dynamics of both positive (i.e.; attraction, helping behavior) and negative (i.e.; prejudice,
aggression) social relations
Attendance & Participation
It is expected that you will attend each class meeting. Be aware that material will be
presented in class that is not available in your textbook, material that is fair game for the exams.
If you do miss a class, it is your responsibility to obtain the information presented in the class
you missed.
Final Grading
Students’ grade for the semester will use the following scale cutoffs of the percentage of
points earned in the course that is listed as the default for the College of Arts & Sciences:
A+ = 100% A = 95% A- = 90%
B+ = 87% B = 83% B- = 80%
C+ = 77% C = 73% C- = 70%
D+ = 67% D = 63% D- = 60%
F = < 60%
In calculating your final grade, I will round grades up to the next highest step if applicable (e.g.;
79.45% to 80%; 92.45% to 93%). However, I will not add points beyond rounding so students
can make the next highest letter grade, maintain a scholarship or athletic eligibility, etc. Please do
not ask.
Exams
There will be five exams during the class. The first four combined will be worth 70% of
your final grade, with a cumulative final exam worth 30% of your final grade.
The first four exams will cover only the material presented since the previous exam. The
final exam is cumulative. The exams will consist of multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short
answer questions. Exams will cover text and class material.
Note that all tests must be taken on-line through Collab during class. Details about
how to do this will be given in class. Students are asked not to look at any past tests from this

PSYC 2600-100 – F2019 Syllabus 3
course to which they might have access. LOOKING AT PAST TESTS IS CONSIDERED AN
HONOR OFFENSE. It is also an honor offense to share information about a test given in this
class with other students. Please note that University policy prohibits students from taking tests
or exams before the scheduled dates
Exam Make-Up
Please take the exam dates on the syllabus into consideration when making travel plans
and appointments for the semester, as exams will not be moved for student convenience.
Missing an exam will result in a score of zero on that exam. However, students can choose which
three exam scores count towards their total grade calculation for the semester. (NOTE: this does
not include the comprehensive final, which will always be counted). Be aware that this
accommodation is the way this class will deal with absences due to personal illness, mishap, etc.
That is, if you have a conflict, don’t ask for a make-up exam so you can “save” your exam drop
for later. That is not the intended use of this policy.
The Dean of Undergraduate Academic Programs has asked that faculty allow for
rescheduling in the case of serious family illness or death, religious obligations, and participation
in NCAA athletic contests. Only the first of these is unexpected; students wishing to reschedule
exams due to athletic or religious obligations should be aware of such conflicts upon receiving
the syllabus and should request rescheduling within the first full week of classes.
It is rare that students will have two or more exam scheduling concerns over the course of
the semester. You will need to speak with me individually if this is the case.
Final Exam
The final will be administered during the assigned final exam time in our regularly
assigned classroom. Given the time of year and pressures to grade, moving the final exam will
not be accommodated unless it meets the College of Arts & Sciences criteria: three or more
exams on two consecutive days. If this describes you, you will need to fill out the Exam
Postponement form found on the College's Forms page (link) and bring it to me to sign, then
submit it to the appropriate College office. Please note that the make-up time will only be
available for students who successfully petition to have their exam postponed through channels –
it’s not an option for you to choose which time best suits you.
Post-Exam Questions
Exams typically take about a week to grade, and will be posted via Collab. Students may
wish to discuss a particular question with myself or the TA(s) to clarify their understanding or to
petition for an equally strong alternative or improved scoring. In dealing with these questions,
this class will follow the 24/7 Rule:
 You MUST wait 24 hours from the return of the exam to ask a question, and
 You have 7 days to pose your question.
Requests to change marks on previous exams received after 7 days will not be considered. Please
see the document The 24/7 Rule & Post-Exam Questions in the Resources tab for more details.
Please note that if the TA(s) or I receive an email prior to the end of the 24-hour
moratorium, we will simply delete it. Additionally, please be aware that prior to, during, or after
class in the classroom is not an appropriate place to be discussing questions.

Course Overview:
The poet Robert Frost once said “Home is the place where, when you
have to go there, they have to take you in.” If this is home, what is
family? How do we know family when we see it? What do families do
for their members, historically and in contemporary times? This class
will help you think about family as a social construct – to critically
assess who counts as a family and how that has changed, and to
consider how social factors such as work, the state, and inequality
shape the experience of care and intimacy.
Sociology usually looks to explain broad trends and patterns, but the
sociology of the family is often taught instead as a series of discrete
units aimed at different components of families: marriage, divorce,
fathers, children, and the like. This course is organized differently: we
will look at families less as a noun than as a verb, so that we can think
about what families do rather than what families are. Organizing the
course in this way helps avoid the pitfalls that plague many other
approaches: namely, a centering of a particular kind of family (white,
middle-class, nuclear) and a marginalization of other ways of
organizing care. In this class we will consider how families do care,
provisioning, and intimacy, and also consider how the organization of
work, the state, and inequalities of race, class and gender shape the
kind of caring/provisioning/intimacy that we experience. We conclude
by considering steps towards a more family-friendly state, economy,
and culture.
Requirements include a midterm, a final exam and three types of
writing, including reading responses, a book review, and an interview
analysis (more information below). We’ll also sprinkle a few pop
quizzes throughout, so you have an indication of your understanding of
the material.
This class is a collaborative exercise, in which what you get out of it
reflects what you put into it. We assume students will take
responsibility for their own learning, ask questions, challenge
assumptions, and participate actively in section, and when possible, in
lecture. The course has five broad goals for the new skills and
understandings students will have when they leave the course:
 You will grapple with current sociological thinking about
families. What are families like today? Why do we see an
array of diverse family forms? Where did they come from, and
are they here to stay? What are the implications of all this
diversity for how people connect and care for each other? 
 You will reflect upon your own family, and broaden your
exposure to other kinds of families, in the United States
and internationally.
 You will think critically about families and synthesize
concepts, meaning apply ideas learned in class to new facts.
 You will help build a learning community.
 You will write well.
Requirements and grading:
 Reading reports: In 5 weeks of your choice, students will write
an approximately one-page single-spaced response to the
reading (one of these must be in the first three weeks).
Responses should not be simple summaries of the reading,
but instead should interact with it/engage it/render an opinion
about it. Students can do so in multiple ways, such as: 1)
critique the logic, evidence or argument (but please do not spend
much time complaining about the writing/density/difficulty); 2)
put the reading in dialogue with another reading or aspect of
class discussion (e.g., “Jones said hookup culture was a result of
women’s continuing oppression, and this idea is in direct
contradiction to Smith’s point, that women engage in hookup
culture because their career orientation means they don’t have
time for romance”); or 3) apply the ideas in the reading to facts/a
situation/an experience in your life/other reading/politics/civic life
(e.g. “When Jones argued that child labor laws served to punish
and stigmatize working-class families, I remembered working in
my family’s restaurant growing up: my parents knew that other
people thought that was a problem, even though they thought it
taught me discipline and gratitude”). Essentially a good response
works with a reading as if it is a live thing, wrestling with it,
having an opinion about it, applying it to something else. (At
least one of these is in the first three weeks). Graded on
a √+/- basis; worth 15% of your grade.
 Book review: Students will write a double-spaced 2-4 page
review of an academic book. You may choose your own, either
from the list at the back of this syllabus or from the
recommended readings, or a book that you get approved in
advance by your TA (must be published by a university press).
You should pick the book by Week 4. Book reviews should
include only 1-2 paragraphs of summary; the rest should be
critique and synthesis, meaning analyzing the work, critically
engaging with its ideas, and situating it with other ideas/sources
of the course. Due Week 5. Worth 10%.
 Interview assignment: Family/Caregiver. Students will
interview a family member or caregiver for 30-60 minutes; the 
interview should be recorded and transcribed. (ALERT: set aside
enough time for this; transcribing can be time-consuming). The
topic of the interview is of your choosing, although it must be
tied in some way to the book you reviewed. Students will
analyze the interview in light of the themes of the book and the
course, and submit a double-spaced 4-6 page analysis, with
excerpts. Students will be given opportunities to practice
interviewing and analysis in section; more details about this
assignment will be posted on Collab. Transcripts are due in
section Week 8; interview analysis is due in section Week 12
and graded on a letter-grade basis. Worth 20%.
 Several pop quizzes (via iclicker or iclicker-enabled
phone): 5%
 In-class midterm Wednesday 10/24: 15%
 Final Exam (Friday 12/14: 0900-1200): 25%
 Section participation/attendance: 10%
Please note:
There will be no incompletes. The following are dates established by
the University:
Wednesday September 12 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion from
the transcript);
Tuesday, September 11-- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit
option, change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an
independent study;
Tuesday, October 23 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
I am committed to creating a course that is inclusive in its design. If
you encounter barriers, please let me know immediately so we can
determine if there is a design adjustment that can be made. I am
happy to consider creative solutions as long as they do not
compromise the intent of the assessment or learning activity. If you are
a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, you are
also welcome to initiate this conversation with the Student Disability
Access Center (SDAC). SDAC works with students with disabilities and
faculty members/TAs to identify reasonable accommodations. Please
visit their website for information and start the application process
online: sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu. If you have already been
approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your
accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an
implementation plan together.
Papers should be submitted through UVa Collab to the sites for your
sections. Please submit your papers in Microsoft Word format with your
name and date at the top. Please name the file by your last name
(example: Smith). Double check to make sure it is uploaded by trying 
to download the file. In addition, your TA may ask that you also
submit your papers in hardcopy (brought to section or lecture on the
due date, with your TA’s name written on the front); check with your TA
about their preference. Late papers will lose one-third of a grade per
day in which they are late (from an A- to a B+, for example).
Each paper should be prepared and written independently. Similar
papers and exams are easy to spot and may be forwarded to the UVA
honor system. All written work submitted in a course, except for
acknowledged quotations, is to be expressed in your own words. It
should also be constructed upon a plan of your devising. Work copied
from a book, from another student’s paper, or from any other source, is
not acceptable, constitutes plagiarism, and violates the UVA honor
code.
Writing a sociology paper is a process of synthesizing the ideas of
others and producing an argument for which you provide evidence.
When you rely on a particular work for ideas, you must acknowledge
that work. Most of the time, you will be paraphrasing these ideas,
which still requires you to cite the work. Very rarely will you be quoting
directly from the text, and generally only when the original passage
was so beautifully written you could not improve upon it. All such
passages must be placed within quotation marks or otherwise
identified. Your TA will be glad to answer questions as to the proper
use of footnotes and citations for identification of sources; also see the
appendix at the end of this syllabus for further guidance.
Resources for writing:
Free individual tutoring is available in the Writing Center for all
students. Located in Bryan 314, the Center is open Monday-Friday. It
gets busy as the semester progresses, but you can make an
appointment by calling 924-6678.
They write: “our tutors can work with you to clarify your ideas,
strengthen your argument, improve your transitions, brush up on your
grammar, as well as improve other writing skills. You may bring in your
paper at any point in the writing process, including the brainstorming
phase. In compliance with UVa's honor code, we cannot offer editing or
proofreading services.”
The following is also worthwhile to consult, a good website with
guidelines for writing sociology papers:

MATERIALS
The course will rely on the following books, available for purchase at
the UVA bookstore or on reserve at Clemons library (see:
https://reserves.lib.virginia.edu/?loc=cl&user=ap9cd&course=SOC2052). Other
readings are available on Collab. Recommended readings are optional,
for those students who have time and are interested. Please print the
required readings, read them (preferably before the lecture day for
which they are assigned), and bring them to section. If you have any
problems accessing the readings, let your TA know immediately.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES: PLAGIARISM VS. PROPER CITATION
(with thanks to Prof. Carol Mershon, UVA Politics)
Under the Honor System at this University, plagiarism warrants
expulsion. Obviously, you should never plagiarize. According to the
pamphlet, Academic Fraud and the Honor System, published by the
University of Virginia (no date given): “Plagiarism is the use of the
distinctive ideas or words belonging to another person without
adequate acknowledgment of that person's contribution.” Taking
responsibility for your own intellectual work and giving credit to others
for their work go to the heart of what we do at a university. To repeat:
You should never, under any circumstances, plagiarize.
The U.Va. English Department places acts of plagiarism into three
categories: “failing to cite quotations and borrowed ideas; failing to
enclose direct quotations in quotation marks; failing to put summaries
and paraphrases in your own words” (quotation from
http://www.engl.virginia.edu/wctr/plagiarism.html ). Avoid all three
sorts of pitfalls.
If I identify an instance of plagiarism in any assignment submitted by a
student, that student will earn the grade of F for the course, in addition
to other possible outcomes. 
How do you make sure you understand proper rules of citation vs. acts
of plagiarism? Consult such classic style manuals as The Chicago
Manual of Style (University of Chicago Press, 14th ed., 1993) and
William Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White, The Elements of Style (Macmillan,
3
rd ed., 1979). The following URLs are also likely to be helpful:
http://www.engl.virginia.edu/wctr/plagiarism.html This excellent site
gives examples of proper citation and proper paraphrasing, and
thus clarifies what constitutes plagiarism. Check references too.
http://plagiarism.phys.virginia.edu Includes a wealth of related links.
http://trc.virginia.edu/Resources/Online.htm Resources on cheating and
plagiarism from the U.Va. Teaching Resource Center.
http://www.academicintegrity.org Rich source, well worth
investigating.
http://www.duke.edu/web/HonorCouncil/citation.htm
Excellent Duke webpage on proper citation, with extremely
helpful links.
http://www.rbs2.com/plag.htm
Superb site on why plagiarism is wrong and what it is. One of the
few sites to discuss plagiarism as a legal issue.
http://www.georgetown.edu/honor/plagiarism.html
Useful site, though perhaps not as good as the Duke one.

Course Overview:
The poet Robert Frost once said “Home is the place where, when you
have to go there, they have to take you in.” If this is home, what is
family? How do we know family when we see it? What do families do
for their members, historically and in contemporary times? This class
will help you think about family as a social construct – to critically
assess who counts as a family and how that has changed, and to
consider how social factors such as work, the state, and inequality
shape the experience of care and intimacy.
Sociology usually looks to explain broad trends and patterns, but the
sociology of the family is often taught instead as a series of discrete
units aimed at different components of families: marriage, divorce,
fathers, children, and the like. This course is organized differently: we
will look at families less as a noun than as a verb, so that we can think
about what families do rather than what families are. Organizing the
course in this way helps avoid the pitfalls that plague many other
approaches: namely, a centering of a particular kind of family (white,
middle-class, nuclear) and a marginalization of other ways of
organizing care. In this class we will consider how families do care,
provisioning, and intimacy, and also consider how the organization of
work, the state, and inequalities of race, class and gender shape the
kind of caring/provisioning/intimacy that we experience. We conclude
by considering steps towards a more family-friendly state, economy,
and culture.
Requirements include a midterm, a final exam and three types of
writing, including reading responses, a book review, and an interview
analysis (more information below). We’ll also sprinkle a few pop
quizzes throughout, so you have an indication of your understanding of
the material.
This class is a collaborative exercise, in which what you get out of it
reflects what you put into it. We assume students will take
responsibility for their own learning, ask questions, challenge
assumptions, and participate actively in section, and when possible, in
lecture. The course has five broad goals for the new skills and
understandings students will have when they leave the course:
 You will grapple with current sociological thinking about
families. What are families like today? Why do we see an
array of diverse family forms? Where did they come from, and
are they here to stay? What are the implications of all this
diversity for how people connect and care for each other? 
 You will reflect upon your own family, and broaden your
exposure to other kinds of families, in the United States
and internationally.
 You will think critically about families and synthesize
concepts, meaning apply ideas learned in class to new facts.
 You will help build a learning community.
 You will write well.
Requirements and grading:
 Reading reports: In 5 weeks of your choice, students will write
an approximately one-page single-spaced response to the
reading (one of these must be in the first three weeks).
Responses should not be simple summaries of the reading,
but instead should interact with it/engage it/render an opinion
about it. Students can do so in multiple ways, such as: 1)
critique the logic, evidence or argument (but please do not spend
much time complaining about the writing/density/difficulty); 2)
put the reading in dialogue with another reading or aspect of
class discussion (e.g., “Jones said hookup culture was a result of
women’s continuing oppression, and this idea is in direct
contradiction to Smith’s point, that women engage in hookup
culture because their career orientation means they don’t have
time for romance”); or 3) apply the ideas in the reading to facts/a
situation/an experience in your life/other reading/politics/civic life
(e.g. “When Jones argued that child labor laws served to punish
and stigmatize working-class families, I remembered working in
my family’s restaurant growing up: my parents knew that other
people thought that was a problem, even though they thought it
taught me discipline and gratitude”). Essentially a good response
works with a reading as if it is a live thing, wrestling with it,
having an opinion about it, applying it to something else. (At
least one of these is in the first three weeks). Graded on
a √+/- basis; worth 15% of your grade.
 Book review: Students will write a double-spaced 2-4 page
review of an academic book. You may choose your own, either
from the list at the back of this syllabus or from the
recommended readings, or a book that you get approved in
advance by your TA (must be published by a university press).
You should pick the book by Week 4. Book reviews should
include only 1-2 paragraphs of summary; the rest should be
critique and synthesis, meaning analyzing the work, critically
engaging with its ideas, and situating it with other ideas/sources
of the course. Due Week 5. Worth 10%.
 Interview assignment: Family/Caregiver. Students will
interview a family member or caregiver for 30-60 minutes; the 
interview should be recorded and transcribed. (ALERT: set aside
enough time for this; transcribing can be time-consuming). The
topic of the interview is of your choosing, although it must be
tied in some way to the book you reviewed. Students will
analyze the interview in light of the themes of the book and the
course, and submit a double-spaced 4-6 page analysis, with
excerpts. Students will be given opportunities to practice
interviewing and analysis in section; more details about this
assignment will be posted on Collab. Transcripts are due in
section Week 8; interview analysis is due in section Week 12
and graded on a letter-grade basis. Worth 20%.
 Several pop quizzes (via iclicker or iclicker-enabled
phone): 5%
 In-class midterm Wednesday 10/24: 15%
 Final Exam (Friday 12/14: 0900-1200): 25%
 Section participation/attendance: 10%
Please note:
There will be no incompletes. The following are dates established by
the University:
Wednesday September 12 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion from
the transcript);
Tuesday, September 11-- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit
option, change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an
independent study;
Tuesday, October 23 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
I am committed to creating a course that is inclusive in its design. If
you encounter barriers, please let me know immediately so we can
determine if there is a design adjustment that can be made. I am
happy to consider creative solutions as long as they do not
compromise the intent of the assessment or learning activity. If you are
a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, you are
also welcome to initiate this conversation with the Student Disability
Access Center (SDAC). SDAC works with students with disabilities and
faculty members/TAs to identify reasonable accommodations. Please
visit their website for information and start the application process
online: sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu. If you have already been
approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your
accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an
implementation plan together.
Papers should be submitted through UVa Collab to the sites for your
sections. Please submit your papers in Microsoft Word format with your
name and date at the top. Please name the file by your last name
(example: Smith). Double check to make sure it is uploaded by trying 
to download the file. In addition, your TA may ask that you also
submit your papers in hardcopy (brought to section or lecture on the
due date, with your TA’s name written on the front); check with your TA
about their preference. Late papers will lose one-third of a grade per
day in which they are late (from an A- to a B+, for example).
Each paper should be prepared and written independently. Similar
papers and exams are easy to spot and may be forwarded to the UVA
honor system. All written work submitted in a course, except for
acknowledged quotations, is to be expressed in your own words. It
should also be constructed upon a plan of your devising. Work copied
from a book, from another student’s paper, or from any other source, is
not acceptable, constitutes plagiarism, and violates the UVA honor
code.
Writing a sociology paper is a process of synthesizing the ideas of
others and producing an argument for which you provide evidence.
When you rely on a particular work for ideas, you must acknowledge
that work. Most of the time, you will be paraphrasing these ideas,
which still requires you to cite the work. Very rarely will you be quoting
directly from the text, and generally only when the original passage
was so beautifully written you could not improve upon it. All such
passages must be placed within quotation marks or otherwise
identified. Your TA will be glad to answer questions as to the proper
use of footnotes and citations for identification of sources; also see the
appendix at the end of this syllabus for further guidance.
Resources for writing:
Free individual tutoring is available in the Writing Center for all
students. Located in Bryan 314, the Center is open Monday-Friday. It
gets busy as the semester progresses, but you can make an
appointment by calling 924-6678.
They write: “our tutors can work with you to clarify your ideas,
strengthen your argument, improve your transitions, brush up on your
grammar, as well as improve other writing skills. You may bring in your
paper at any point in the writing process, including the brainstorming
phase. In compliance with UVa's honor code, we cannot offer editing or
proofreading services.”
The following is also worthwhile to consult, a good website with
guidelines for writing sociology papers:

MATERIALS
The course will rely on the following books, available for purchase at
the UVA bookstore or on reserve at Clemons library (see:
https://reserves.lib.virginia.edu/?loc=cl&user=ap9cd&course=SOC2052). Other
readings are available on Collab. Recommended readings are optional,
for those students who have time and are interested. Please print the
required readings, read them (preferably before the lecture day for
which they are assigned), and bring them to section. If you have any
problems accessing the readings, let your TA know immediately.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES: PLAGIARISM VS. PROPER CITATION
(with thanks to Prof. Carol Mershon, UVA Politics)
Under the Honor System at this University, plagiarism warrants
expulsion. Obviously, you should never plagiarize. According to the
pamphlet, Academic Fraud and the Honor System, published by the
University of Virginia (no date given): “Plagiarism is the use of the
distinctive ideas or words belonging to another person without
adequate acknowledgment of that person's contribution.” Taking
responsibility for your own intellectual work and giving credit to others
for their work go to the heart of what we do at a university. To repeat:
You should never, under any circumstances, plagiarize.
The U.Va. English Department places acts of plagiarism into three
categories: “failing to cite quotations and borrowed ideas; failing to
enclose direct quotations in quotation marks; failing to put summaries
and paraphrases in your own words” (quotation from
http://www.engl.virginia.edu/wctr/plagiarism.html ). Avoid all three
sorts of pitfalls.
If I identify an instance of plagiarism in any assignment submitted by a
student, that student will earn the grade of F for the course, in addition
to other possible outcomes. 
How do you make sure you understand proper rules of citation vs. acts
of plagiarism? Consult such classic style manuals as The Chicago
Manual of Style (University of Chicago Press, 14th ed., 1993) and
William Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White, The Elements of Style (Macmillan,
3
rd ed., 1979). The following URLs are also likely to be helpful:
http://www.engl.virginia.edu/wctr/plagiarism.html This excellent site
gives examples of proper citation and proper paraphrasing, and
thus clarifies what constitutes plagiarism. Check references too.
http://plagiarism.phys.virginia.edu Includes a wealth of related links.
http://trc.virginia.edu/Resources/Online.htm Resources on cheating and
plagiarism from the U.Va. Teaching Resource Center.
http://www.academicintegrity.org Rich source, well worth
investigating.
http://www.duke.edu/web/HonorCouncil/citation.htm
Excellent Duke webpage on proper citation, with extremely
helpful links.
http://www.rbs2.com/plag.htm
Superb site on why plagiarism is wrong and what it is. One of the
few sites to discuss plagiarism as a legal issue.
http://www.georgetown.edu/honor/plagiarism.html
Useful site, though perhaps not as good as the Duke one.

Course Overview:
The poet Robert Frost once said “Home is the place where, when you
have to go there, they have to take you in.” If this is home, what is
family? How do we know family when we see it? What do families do
for their members, historically and in contemporary times? This class
will help you think about family as a social construct – to critically
assess who counts as a family and how that has changed, and to
consider how social factors such as work, the state, and inequality
shape the experience of care and intimacy.
Sociology usually looks to explain broad trends and patterns, but the
sociology of the family is often taught instead as a series of discrete
units aimed at different components of families: marriage, divorce,
fathers, children, and the like. This course is organized differently: we
will look at families less as a noun than as a verb, so that we can think
about what families do rather than what families are. Organizing the
course in this way helps avoid the pitfalls that plague many other
approaches: namely, a centering of a particular kind of family (white,
middle-class, nuclear) and a marginalization of other ways of
organizing care. In this class we will consider how families do care,
provisioning, and intimacy, and also consider how the organization of
work, the state, and inequalities of race, class and gender shape the
kind of caring/provisioning/intimacy that we experience. We conclude
by considering steps towards a more family-friendly state, economy,
and culture.
Requirements include a midterm, a final exam and three types of
writing, including reading responses, a book review, and an interview
analysis (more information below). We’ll also sprinkle a few pop
quizzes throughout, so you have an indication of your understanding of
the material.
This class is a collaborative exercise, in which what you get out of it
reflects what you put into it. We assume students will take
responsibility for their own learning, ask questions, challenge
assumptions, and participate actively in section, and when possible, in
lecture. The course has five broad goals for the new skills and
understandings students will have when they leave the course:
 You will grapple with current sociological thinking about
families. What are families like today? Why do we see an
array of diverse family forms? Where did they come from, and
are they here to stay? What are the implications of all this
diversity for how people connect and care for each other? 
 You will reflect upon your own family, and broaden your
exposure to other kinds of families, in the United States
and internationally.
 You will think critically about families and synthesize
concepts, meaning apply ideas learned in class to new facts.
 You will help build a learning community.
 You will write well.
Requirements and grading:
 Reading reports: In 5 weeks of your choice, students will write
an approximately one-page single-spaced response to the
reading (one of these must be in the first three weeks).
Responses should not be simple summaries of the reading,
but instead should interact with it/engage it/render an opinion
about it. Students can do so in multiple ways, such as: 1)
critique the logic, evidence or argument (but please do not spend
much time complaining about the writing/density/difficulty); 2)
put the reading in dialogue with another reading or aspect of
class discussion (e.g., “Jones said hookup culture was a result of
women’s continuing oppression, and this idea is in direct
contradiction to Smith’s point, that women engage in hookup
culture because their career orientation means they don’t have
time for romance”); or 3) apply the ideas in the reading to facts/a
situation/an experience in your life/other reading/politics/civic life
(e.g. “When Jones argued that child labor laws served to punish
and stigmatize working-class families, I remembered working in
my family’s restaurant growing up: my parents knew that other
people thought that was a problem, even though they thought it
taught me discipline and gratitude”). Essentially a good response
works with a reading as if it is a live thing, wrestling with it,
having an opinion about it, applying it to something else. (At
least one of these is in the first three weeks). Graded on
a √+/- basis; worth 15% of your grade.
 Book review: Students will write a double-spaced 2-4 page
review of an academic book. You may choose your own, either
from the list at the back of this syllabus or from the
recommended readings, or a book that you get approved in
advance by your TA (must be published by a university press).
You should pick the book by Week 4. Book reviews should
include only 1-2 paragraphs of summary; the rest should be
critique and synthesis, meaning analyzing the work, critically
engaging with its ideas, and situating it with other ideas/sources
of the course. Due Week 5. Worth 10%.
 Interview assignment: Family/Caregiver. Students will
interview a family member or caregiver for 30-60 minutes; the 
interview should be recorded and transcribed. (ALERT: set aside
enough time for this; transcribing can be time-consuming). The
topic of the interview is of your choosing, although it must be
tied in some way to the book you reviewed. Students will
analyze the interview in light of the themes of the book and the
course, and submit a double-spaced 4-6 page analysis, with
excerpts. Students will be given opportunities to practice
interviewing and analysis in section; more details about this
assignment will be posted on Collab. Transcripts are due in
section Week 8; interview analysis is due in section Week 12
and graded on a letter-grade basis. Worth 20%.
Several pop quizzes (via iclicker or iclicker-enabled
phone): 5%
In-class midterm Wednesday 10/24: 15%
 Final Exam (Friday 12/14: 0900-1200): 25%
Section participation/attendance: 10%
Please note:
There will be no incompletes. The following are dates established by
the University:
Wednesday September 12 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion from
the transcript);
Tuesday, September 11-- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit
option, change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an
independent study;
Tuesday, October 23 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
I am committed to creating a course that is inclusive in its design. If
you encounter barriers, please let me know immediately so we can
determine if there is a design adjustment that can be made. I am
happy to consider creative solutions as long as they do not
compromise the intent of the assessment or learning activity. If you are
a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, you are
also welcome to initiate this conversation with the Student Disability
Access Center (SDAC). SDAC works with students with disabilities and
faculty members/TAs to identify reasonable accommodations. Please
visit their website for information and start the application process
online: sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu. If you have already been
approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your
accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an
implementation plan together.
Papers should be submitted through UVa Collab to the sites for your
sections. Please submit your papers in Microsoft Word format with your
name and date at the top. Please name the file by your last name
(example: Smith). Double check to make sure it is uploaded by trying 
to download the file. In addition, your TA may ask that you also
submit your papers in hardcopy (brought to section or lecture on the
due date, with your TA’s name written on the front); check with your TA
about their preference. Late papers will lose one-third of a grade per
day in which they are late (from an A- to a B+, for example).
Each paper should be prepared and written independently. Similar
papers and exams are easy to spot and may be forwarded to the UVA
honor system. All written work submitted in a course, except for
acknowledged quotations, is to be expressed in your own words. It
should also be constructed upon a plan of your devising. Work copied
from a book, from another student’s paper, or from any other source, is
not acceptable, constitutes plagiarism, and violates the UVA honor
code.
Writing a sociology paper is a process of synthesizing the ideas of
others and producing an argument for which you provide evidence.
When you rely on a particular work for ideas, you must acknowledge
that work. Most of the time, you will be paraphrasing these ideas,
which still requires you to cite the work. Very rarely will you be quoting
directly from the text, and generally only when the original passage
was so beautifully written you could not improve upon it. All such
passages must be placed within quotation marks or otherwise
identified. Your TA will be glad to answer questions as to the proper
use of footnotes and citations for identification of sources; also see the
appendix at the end of this syllabus for further guidance.
Resources for writing:
Free individual tutoring is available in the Writing Center for all
students. Located in Bryan 314, the Center is open Monday-Friday. It
gets busy as the semester progresses, but you can make an
appointment by calling 924-6678.
They write: “our tutors can work with you to clarify your ideas,
strengthen your argument, improve your transitions, brush up on your
grammar, as well as improve other writing skills. You may bring in your
paper at any point in the writing process, including the brainstorming
phase. In compliance with UVa's honor code, we cannot offer editing or
proofreading services.”
The following is also worthwhile to consult, a good website with
guidelines for writing sociology papers:
MATERIALS
The course will rely on the following books, available for purchase at
the UVA bookstore or on reserve at Clemons library. Other

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES: PLAGIARISM VS. PROPER CITATION
Under the Honor System at this University, plagiarism warrants
expulsion. Obviously, you should never plagiarize. According to the
pamphlet, Academic Fraud and the Honor System, published by the
University of Virginia (no date given): “Plagiarism is the use of the
distinctive ideas or words belonging to another person without
adequate acknowledgment of that person's contribution.” Taking
responsibility for your own intellectual work and giving credit to others
for their work go to the heart of what we do at a university. To repeat:
You should never, under any circumstances, plagiarize.
The U.Va. English Department places acts of plagiarism into three
categories: “failing to cite quotations and borrowed ideas; failing to
enclose direct quotations in quotation marks; failing to put summaries
and paraphrases in your own words” (quotation from
http://www.engl.virginia.edu/wctr/plagiarism.html ). Avoid all three
sorts of pitfalls.
If I identify an instance of plagiarism in any assignment submitted by a
student, that student will earn the grade of F for the course, in addition
to other possible outcomes. 
How do you make sure you understand proper rules of citation vs. acts
of plagiarism? Consult such classic style manuals as The Chicago
Manual of Style (University of Chicago Press, 14th ed., 1993) and
, The Elements of Style (Macmillan,
rd ed., 1979). The following URLs are also likely to be helpful:
http://www.engl.virginia.edu/wctr/plagiarism.html This excellent site
gives examples of proper citation and proper paraphrasing, and
thus clarifies what constitutes plagiarism. Check references too.
http://plagiarism.phys.virginia.edu Includes a wealth of related links.
h Resources on cheating and
plagiarism from the U.Va. Teaching Resource Center.
http://www.academicintegrity.org Rich source, well worth
investigating.
Excellent Duke webpage on proper citation, with extremely
helpful links.

Superb site on why plagiarism is wrong and what it is. One of the
few sites to discuss plagiarism as a legal issue.
http://www.georgetown.edu/honor/plagiarism.html
Useful site, though perhaps not as good as the Duke one.

Course Overview
GEOG 30N: Environment and Society in a Changing World (3 credits) GEOG 30N is an integrative study, inter-domain general education course. Students who started at Penn State prior to summer 2018 can apply these credits to either GS or GN requirements. The course also covers U.S. or international cultures requirements.

GEOG 30N can be applied toward Penn State's General Education(link is external) [3] ""Social and Behavioral Sciences"" (GS), ""Natural Sciences"" (GN), ""United States Cultures,"" or ""International Cultures"" (IL) requirements.

Prerequisites: None

This course introduces the study of sustainability and human-environment interactions from a geographic perspective. We examine both the influence of humanity on the environment and the influence of the environment on humanity, with attention to the sustainability of current human activities. We take a complex systems perspective on major environmental and societal challenges and examine linked human-environment issues in a variety of contexts. We emphasize the major individual and societal decisions which impact the environment and the ethical views implicit in the decisions. We explore key concepts such as scale, systems analysis, and individual and collective action, as well as various topical issues related to climate change, agriculture, biodiversity, and development. The key concepts above are cross-cutting and applicable to several topical issues; in turn, topical issues are strongly interrelated. By introducing cross-cutting key concepts and asking students to apply them across topical issues in human-environment systems familiar to them, this course encourages students to think both within and beyond the main topic of each unit, thereby integrating previous and new knowledge. Course assignments highlight both major themes in human-environment geography and the experience of what it is like to perform human-environment geography.

Where Is This Class Held/When Does It Meet?

All components of GEOG 30N will be conducted entirely on the World Wide Web. You do not have to be in University Park campus at any point of the course period or afterward for course completion, so long as you have reliable access to the Internet. There will be no set class meeting times, so students are responsible for setting aside time to complete the course work. 

How Is The Course Structured? 

There are 10 modules spread over three units that will be completed over the course of the 15-week semester. GEOG 30N will be conducted entirely on the World Wide Web. There will be no set class meeting times, so students are responsible for setting aside time to complete the course work. Each module contains readings, links, animations, movies, and novel explanations of the basic principles related to sustainability and human-environment systems. Each of the three units includes two writtten assignments and will conclude with an open book, on-line assessment. There is no final exam for this course in Fall 2022.

Written assignments are due approximately every two or three weeks. The deadline for the submission will always be on Friday's by 11:59 pm EST. You should plan ahead as these assignments require a deep grasp of the module material as well as independent research to complete. We recommend beginning work on them at least one week prior to the due date. Please check Canvas regularly to ensure that you are completing all written assignments and quizzes on time. Anything not completed by the due date at midnight will be considered late and will receive a point deduction.

Modules will be graded with feedback in a timely manner, generally during the 10 days following their submission. Due dates for the assignments must be strictly followed. An exception will only be made in case of an official, written documentation of a family or personal medical emergency. Lack of Internet access is NOT a valid exception. Do the work ahead of time and you should easily avoid this issue.

Late Exams will NOT be accepted

Note:
All components of this course will be conducted entirely online. You do not have to be in University Park campus at any point of the course period or afterward for course completion, so long as you have reliable access to the Internet.

What Do We Expect of You?
We expect that you will treat this course in the same manner you would a face-to-face section of an introductory level course. You should expect to spend the same amount of time on this course that you would spend in and out of class in your other courses. On average, that may be about eight hours per week. However, you will find your workload depends on your familiarity with the technology needed to take an online course and any past experience you have with the subject matter.

In our experience, the students who reach their goals in online courses are those that are able to motivate themselves to keep up with the coursework and those that take the opportunity to communicate with the instructor and their peers. We encourage you to ask as many questions as you would in a face-to-face class. If you are struggling with any aspect of the course, we can only help you if you ask.

Specific learning objectives for each module and assignment are detailed within each module.

Course Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes
Through completion of course modules, learning activities, and quizzes successful students will:

understand foundational principles of nature-society geography;
build a toolkit of key concepts and theories for analyzing human-environment systems;
evaluate how biophysical and social environments are intertwined and shape one another;
critique specific nature-society problems across a range of geographic contexts;
develop possible solutions for addressing contemporary sustainability challenges.
Required Course Materials
All (other) materials needed for this course are presented online through our course website and in Canvas. In order to access the online materials, you need to have an active Penn State Access Account user ID and password (used to access the online course resources). If you have any questions about obtaining or activating your Penn State Access Account, please contact  Penn State IT Service Desk [4] for World Campus students or  Penn State IT Get Support [5] (for students at all other campus locations).

Assignments and Grading
GEOG 30N will rely upon a variety of methods to assess and evaluate student learning, including:

Written Assignments provide you with an opportunity to synthesize the course concepts and supporting information you’ve learned in the class. These assignments will allow you to communicate your understanding of the material, demonstrate your critical thinking skills, and showcase your ability to analyze information. Each written assignment should be approximately 500-750 words in length, engage a minimum of three course concepts in bolded font, demonstrate quality academic writing skills, and include compelling arguments with supporting evidence. Rubrics are provided for each writing assignment to ensure the expectations for these assessments are clearly articulated to you.

Automated Quizzes will allow you to practice your mastery of the concepts presented in the course readings and supporting materials. There are three quizzes you will be required to participate in throughout the semester. Each quiz consists of approximately 25 questions and is open note. These assessments are autograded by Canvas, so you will receive your scores immediately upon submission of your quiz.

You will earn a grade that reflects the extent to which you achieve the course learning objectives listed above. Grades are assigned by the percentage of possible points earned in each module's activities. Below is a breakdown of each assignment's value as a percentage of the total course grade.

Breakdown of course assignments as points and a percentage of the total course grade
Assessment	Points	Total Points	% of Course Grade
Written Assignments (6)	50 points each	300	65%
Quizzes (3)	50 points each	150	35%
Total Possible		450	100%
Each assignment is worth 10% of your grade. I expect well-written assignments that demonstrate a strong grasp of the course material. For grading rubrics and tips for getting good grades on the written assignments and quizzes, please see the Assignments [6] page.

Make-up Exam Policy
We expect students to plan for and to take all quizzes and exams during the open period for each. In exceptional circumstances, make-up exams and quizzes will only be granted through the approval of the course instructor for legitimate and excused absences. Prior notification and approval for a make-up exam must be obtained by the student at least 72 hours prior to the scheduled exam. Special circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Curve
There is no grading curve in this course.

Late Policy
In exceptional circumstances, you should contact me, your instructor, Elise, at eaq10@psu.edu . The earlier you contact me to request a late submission, the better. Requests will be considered on a case by case basis. 

Late Written Assignments will be penalized at 10% per day. Activities more than seven days late automatically receive zero points. All assignments have precise (to the minute) deadlines that are understood in terms of Eastern Standard Time (EST) as applied in Penn State's resident campuses in Pennsylvania. Anything past the deadline is automatically late, even if it is just one minute late. Every 24 hours (to the minute) after the deadline, another day of late penalty is incurred.

Grades
We will use the Canvas gradebook to keep track of your grades. The minimum scores for course grades are as follows.

Letter Grades and Points
Letter	Minimum Points Needed to Earn this Grade
A	94%
A-	90%
B+	87%
B	84%
B-	80.0%
C+ 	77%

Tips for Success in GEOG 30N
Pay extra attention to course announcements
Read all the email announcements and read the whole announcement when you do. Unlike face-to-face courses where instructors have more diverse means to get your attention, online courses typically have email as the only channel through which you can get news and reminders. Not paying full attention to the emails may result in your missing deadlines and opportunities, which will be detrimental to your grade.

Participate
In order to make the most out of this opportunity, you will need to be actively involved in this course. 

Do the work on time
I see my role in this course as lead facilitator; that is, it is my job to help you achieve your educational objectives. I set deadlines to keep everyone on track to reach those goals. I think that if you do your best to adhere to those deadlines (for example, setting up a routine schedule when you work on the course), you will succeed. I strongly suggest setting a personal deadline that is earlier than the class deadline, which will help you avoid most issues that tend to cause delays. As described earlier in this syllabus, I am firm on deadlines. However, I do understand that emergencies may arise, and I am willing to work with you if I am informed (preferably ahead of time) and the reason was unavoidable.

Struggling? Get help!
There could be a case where you are paying full attention to the announcements and working hard for this course, but still somehow struggling. If this is you, please ask for help! The instructor can be a source of help. Let me know of your concerns (e.g., ways to improve your upcoming assignment) and the situations you want us to take into consideration when instructing and grading. Also, in case you didn't know, you can go to Penn State to get institutional yet individualized help! If you would like advice on writing, please go to Penn State Learning website for more resources (https://pennstatelearning.psu.edu/tutoring/writing [8]). They give you a range of tutoring options from online tutoring to in-person meetings by appointment.

Additional Course Policies
Academic Integrity
I will assume that everyone in the class will behave with integrity. As a student at Penn State, this goes beyond simply avoiding ""what you assume"" as lying and cheating, but accepting and adhering to what Penn State regards as academic integrity and violation of the value. You will have to actively study to be a person of integrity and remain as one. Penn State defines academic integrity as ""the pursuit of scholarly projects in an open, honest and responsible manner."" Academic integrity includes ""a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception."" In particular, the University defines plagiarism as ""the fabrication of information and citations; submitting others' work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other students' papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one's own."" I have zero tolerance for plagiarism, including self-plagiarism, and I will be checking for it. Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include course failure and I have observed students failing the course as a consequence. 

Academic Integrity Advice
Your violation being an ""honest mistake"" may help reduce the severity of your sanction, but it does NOT make your violation a non-violation. If you are really an honest person and made one mistake, you will naturally want to study to make sure you don't do it again. Penn State does have buffer measures for its members (e.g., your one-time breach will amount to nothing in terms of your career until you make two more breaches) but it does NOT have enough measures for those people who simply do not care if they repeat similar kind of mistakes or not.
Remaining a student of academic integrity needs active work. You need to study what academic integrity means to avoid violation of it. Individuals do NOT define what academic integrity is and what actions violate it. It is Penn State who defines it for its members. This is because individual opinions vary, and we cannot accommodate all. But as you understand the process of making Penn State policy, you will probably understand how the policies we have came to exist and what purposes they serve.
If in doubt, please consult official materials and relevant person(s) before taking any action.
You may collaborate before taking quizzes or submitting essays (working toward making an efficient summary of course materials), but you may not communicate anything related to quiz content in any form during the quiz with your coursemates or any person, or third-party website once the quiz questions are revealed to you. Similarly, you are not to share essay feedback with coursemates or third-party websites. 
Do not procure actual quiz questions from former takers of quizzes. Yes, it is a violation of academic integrity.
Nobody can stand in for you. Do not let any other person take any part of your quiz for you or lend knowledge of questions. This applies to you being the source of information.
Citation and Reference Style
In this course, you will be expected to follow a specific formatting guideline for your references. You should use Chicago Style or APA format for all citations done in all assignments in this class. You can see specific examples of how to cite different types of references (books, journal articles, website, etc.) by visiting the Chicago Manual of Style [9] reference guide or APA [10] style manual. Please make sure that you have selected 'Author/Date' not 'Notes and Bibliography' when reviewing the formatting guidelines. To make this process as easy as possible, you may use a free citation manager, such as Zotero [11], to collect, organize, and format your references.

You can also visit the ""Plagiarism"" section in Penn State's Academic Integrity training website [12] to learn more about how and when to cite.

Netiquette
The term ""Netiquette"" refers to the etiquette guidelines for electronic communications, such as email and bulletin board postings. Netiquette covers not only rules to maintain civility in discussions, but also special guidelines unique to the electronic nature of forum messages. Please review Virginia Shea's ""The Core Rules of Netiquette [13]"" for general guidelines that should be followed when communicating in this course. Most importantly, do not use slang, informal language, or text messaging jargon when communicating via email or when posting to the discussion board. Emails and posts should never begin with ""Hey"" or similarly informal language.

Penn State E-mail Accounts
All official communications from Penn State are sent to students' Penn State e-mail accounts. Be sure to check your Penn State account regularly, or forward your Penn State e-mail [14] to your preferred e-mail account, so you don't miss any important information.

Academic Integrity
This course follows the procedures for academic integrity [15] of Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. Penn State defines academic integrity as ""the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner."" Academic integrity includes ""a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception."" In particular, the University defines plagiarism as ""the fabrication of information and citations; submitting others' work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other students' papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one's own."" Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include course failure. To learn more, see Penn State's Academic Integrity Training for Students [16]. 

Course Copyright
All course materials students receive or to which students have online access are protected by copyright laws. Students may use course materials and make copies for their own use as needed, but unauthorized distribution and/or uploading of materials without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited. University Policy AD 40, the University Policy Recording of Classroom Activities and Note Taking Services addresses this issue. Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials may be held in violation of the University’s Code of Conduct, and/or liable under Federal and State laws.

For example, uploading completed labs, homework, or other assignments to any study site constitutes a violation of this policy.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Office for Student Disability Resources [17] website provides contact information for Campus Disability Coordinators [18]at every Penn State campus. For further information, please visit the Office for Student Disability Resources [17] website

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled. You will participate in an intake interview and provide documentation. See documentation guidelines at Applying for Services from Student Disability Resources [19]. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

Change in Normal Campus Operations
In case of weather-related delays or other emergency camps disruptions or closures at the University, this online course will proceed as planned. Your instructor will inform you if there are any extenuating circumstances regarding content or activity due dates in the course due to these delays or closures. If you are affected by a weather-related emergency, please contact your instructor at the earliest possible time to make special arrangements.

Reporting Educational Equity Concerns
Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated (Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance [20]) and can be reported through Educational Equity via Report Bias [21].

Counseling and Psychological Services
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional well-being.  The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings.  These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity, and sexual orientation.  Services include the following:

Counseling and Psychological Services at University Park  (CAPS) [22]: 814-863-0395
Counseling Services at Commonwealth Campuses [23]
Penn State Crisis Line (24 hours/7 days/week): 877-229-6400
Crisis Text Line (24 hours/7 days/week): Text LIONS to 741741

Military Personnel
Veterans and currently serving military personnel and/or spouses with unique circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill/duty requirements, disabilities, VA appointments, etc.) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor in the case that special arrangements need to be made.

Connect Online with Caution
Penn State is committed to educational access for all. Our students come from all walks of life and have diverse life experiences. As with any other online community, the lack of physical interaction in an online classroom can create a false sense of anonymity and security. While one can make new friends online, digital relationships can also be misleading. Good judgment and decision-making are critical when choosing to disclose personal information to others whom you do not know.

Technical Requirements
For this course, we recommend the minimum technical requirements outlined on the World Campus Technical Requirements [24] page, including the requirements listed for same-time, synchronous communications. If you need technical assistance at any point during the course, please contact the HelpDesk [25] (for World Campus students) or the IT Service Desk [26] (for students at all other campus locations).

Internet Connection
Access to a reliable Internet connection is required for this course. A problem with your Internet access may not be used as an excuse for late, missing, or incomplete coursework. If you experience problems with your Internet connection while working on this course, it is your responsibility to find an alternative Internet access point, such as a public library or Wi-Fi ® hotspot.

Mixed Content
This site is considered a secure web site which means that your connection is encrypted. We do however link to content that isn't necessarily encrypted. This is called mixed content. By default, mixed content is blocked in Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. This may result in a blank page or a message saying that only secure content is displayed. Follow the directions on our Technical Requirements [24] page to view the mixed content.

Equations
This course must be viewed using the latest version of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, or Edge. Internet Explorer is not supported. If you use any other browser, or if you are not using the latest version of your browser, some pages containing equations may not render properly. In addition, javascript must be enabled for equations to render properly. If you have any issues with equations not rendering properly, please update your browser to the latest version or try using a different browser. If you need additional technical assistance at any point during the course, please contact the HelpDesk [25] (for World Campus students) or the IT Service Desk [27] (for students at all other campus locations).
Deferred Grades
If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for reasons that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence of the instructor, following Penn State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40 [28]. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a written request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the instructor describing the reason(s) for the request. Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the final examination period.  It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the instructor to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy.  If for any reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade of ""F"" will be automatically entered on your transcript.

Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect
Penn State is “committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others” as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance [20]. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment and to interact with civility.

Attendance
This course will be conducted entirely online. There will be no set class meeting times, but you will be required to complete weekly assignments with specific due dates. Many of the assignments are open for multiple days, so it is your responsibility to complete the work early if you plan to travel or participate in national holidays, religious observances or University approved activities.

If you need to request an exception due to a personal or medical emergency, contact the instructor directly as soon as you are able. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Mandated Reporting Statement
Penn State’s policies require me, as a faculty member, to share information about incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation) with Penn State’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to me in person or shared by students as part of their coursework. For more information regarding the University's policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual or gender-based harassment or misconduct, please visit Penn State's Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention & Response [34] website.

Additionally, I am required to make a report on any reasonable suspicion of child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law [35].

Welcome to GEOG 30N! We look forward to getting to know you this semester. Please take the time to read the entire syllabus. We share critical information here that will help you succeed in the course, especially regarding assignment expectations and due dates. 

This syllabus is divided into several sections. You can read it sequentially by scrolling down the length of the document.

This course takes place entirely online so please correspond via email. I will do my best to reply to emails within 48 hours. Before emailing with an administrative question, kindly check the course syllabus. As many students tend to have the same questions, you may find it more convenient to use the course Q&A discussion board in the course Canvas page (under Discussions). I will reply to these posts on a daily basis (excluding weekends).

Also, when sending an email or Canvas message, be sure to include at minimum: GEOG 30n in the subject, a salutation addressing me, and your name so I know who is contacting me.

Class Support Services
Penn State Online [1] offers online tutoring to World Campus students in math, writing, and some business classes. Tutoring and guided study groups for residential students are available through Penn State Learning [2].

Course Overview
GEOG 30N: Environment and Society in a Changing World (3 credits) GEOG 30N is an integrative study, inter-domain general education course. Students who started at Penn State prior to summer 2018 can apply these credits to either GS or GN requirements. The course also covers U.S. or international cultures requirements.

GEOG 30N can be applied toward Penn State's General Education(link is external) [3] ""Social and Behavioral Sciences"" (GS), ""Natural Sciences"" (GN), ""United States Cultures,"" or ""International Cultures"" (IL) requirements.

Prerequisites: None

This course introduces the study of sustainability and human-environment interactions from a geographic perspective. We examine both the influence of humanity on the environment and the influence of the environment on humanity, with attention to the sustainability of current human activities. We take a complex systems perspective on major environmental and societal challenges and examine linked human-environment issues in a variety of contexts. We emphasize the major individual and societal decisions which impact the environment and the ethical views implicit in the decisions. We explore key concepts such as scale, systems analysis, and individual and collective action, as well as various topical issues related to climate change, agriculture, biodiversity, and development. The key concepts above are cross-cutting and applicable to several topical issues; in turn, topical issues are strongly interrelated. By introducing cross-cutting key concepts and asking students to apply them across topical issues in human-environment systems familiar to them, this course encourages students to think both within and beyond the main topic of each unit, thereby integrating previous and new knowledge. Course assignments highlight both major themes in human-environment geography and the experience of what it is like to perform human-environment geography.

Where Is This Class Held/When Does It Meet?

All components of GEOG 30N will be conducted entirely on the World Wide Web. You do not have to be in University Park campus at any point of the course period or afterward for course completion, so long as you have reliable access to the Internet. There will be no set class meeting times, so students are responsible for setting aside time to complete the course work. 

How Is The Course Structured? 

There are 10 modules spread over three units that will be completed over the course of the 15-week semester. GEOG 30N will be conducted entirely on the World Wide Web. There will be no set class meeting times, so students are responsible for setting aside time to complete the course work. Each module contains readings, links, animations, movies, and novel explanations of the basic principles related to sustainability and human-environment systems. Each of the three units includes two writtten assignments and will conclude with an open book, on-line assessment. There is no final exam for this course in Fall 2022.

Written assignments are due approximately every two or three weeks. The deadline for the submission will always be on Friday's by 11:59 pm EST. You should plan ahead as these assignments require a deep grasp of the module material as well as independent research to complete. We recommend beginning work on them at least one week prior to the due date. Please check Canvas regularly to ensure that you are completing all written assignments and quizzes on time. Anything not completed by the due date at midnight will be considered late and will receive a point deduction.

Modules will be graded with feedback in a timely manner, generally during the 10 days following their submission. Due dates for the assignments must be strictly followed. An exception will only be made in case of an official, written documentation of a family or personal medical emergency. Lack of Internet access is NOT a valid exception. Do the work ahead of time and you should easily avoid this issue.

Late Exams will NOT be accepted

Note:
All components of this course will be conducted entirely online. You do not have to be in University Park campus at any point of the course period or afterward for course completion, so long as you have reliable access to the Internet.

What Do We Expect of You?
We expect that you will treat this course in the same manner you would a face-to-face section of an introductory level course. You should expect to spend the same amount of time on this course that you would spend in and out of class in your other courses. On average, that may be about eight hours per week. However, you will find your workload depends on your familiarity with the technology needed to take an online course and any past experience you have with the subject matter.

In our experience, the students who reach their goals in online courses are those that are able to motivate themselves to keep up with the coursework and those that take the opportunity to communicate with the instructor and their peers. We encourage you to ask as many questions as you would in a face-to-face class. If you are struggling with any aspect of the course, we can only help you if you ask.

Specific learning objectives for each module and assignment are detailed within each module.

Course Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes
Through completion of course modules, learning activities, and quizzes successful students will:

understand foundational principles of nature-society geography;
build a toolkit of key concepts and theories for analyzing human-environment systems;
evaluate how biophysical and social environments are intertwined and shape one another;
critique specific nature-society problems across a range of geographic contexts;
develop possible solutions for addressing contemporary sustainability challenges.
Required Course Materials
All (other) materials needed for this course are presented online through our course website and in Canvas. In order to access the online materials, you need to have an active Penn State Access Account user ID and password (used to access the online course resources). If you have any questions about obtaining or activating your Penn State Access Account, please contact  Penn State IT Service Desk [4] for World Campus students or  Penn State IT Get Support [5] (for students at all other campus locations).

Assignments and Grading
GEOG 30N will rely upon a variety of methods to assess and evaluate student learning, including:

Written Assignments provide you with an opportunity to synthesize the course concepts and supporting information you’ve learned in the class. These assignments will allow you to communicate your understanding of the material, demonstrate your critical thinking skills, and showcase your ability to analyze information. Each written assignment should be approximately 500-750 words in length, engage a minimum of three course concepts in bolded font, demonstrate quality academic writing skills, and include compelling arguments with supporting evidence. Rubrics are provided for each writing assignment to ensure the expectations for these assessments are clearly articulated to you.

Automated Quizzes will allow you to practice your mastery of the concepts presented in the course readings and supporting materials. There are three quizzes you will be required to participate in throughout the semester. Each quiz consists of approximately 25 questions and is open note. These assessments are autograded by Canvas, so you will receive your scores immediately upon submission of your quiz.

You will earn a grade that reflects the extent to which you achieve the course learning objectives listed above. Grades are assigned by the percentage of possible points earned in each module's activities. Below is a breakdown of each assignment's value as a percentage of the total course grade.

Breakdown of course assignments as points and a percentage of the total course grade
Assessment        Points        Total Points        % of Course Grade
Written Assignments (6)        50 points each        300        65%
Quizzes (3)        50 points each        150        35%
Total Possible                450        100%
Each assignment is worth 10% of your grade. I expect well-written assignments that demonstrate a strong grasp of the course material. For grading rubrics and tips for getting good grades on the written assignments and quizzes, please see the Assignments [6] page.

Make-up Exam Policy
We expect students to plan for and to take all quizzes and exams during the open period for each. In exceptional circumstances, make-up exams and quizzes will only be granted through the approval of the course instructor for legitimate and excused absences. Prior notification and approval for a make-up exam must be obtained by the student at least 72 hours prior to the scheduled exam. Special circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Curve
There is no grading curve in this course.

Late Policy
In exceptional circumstances, you should contact me, your instructor, Elise, at eaq10@psu.edu . The earlier you contact me to request a late submission, the better. Requests will be considered on a case by case basis. 

Late Written Assignments will be penalized at 10% per day. Activities more than seven days late automatically receive zero points. All assignments have precise (to the minute) deadlines that are understood in terms of Eastern Standard Time (EST) as applied in Penn State's resident campuses in Pennsylvania. Anything past the deadline is automatically late, even if it is just one minute late. Every 24 hours (to the minute) after the deadline, another day of late penalty is incurred.

Grades
We will use the Canvas gradebook to keep track of your grades. The minimum scores for course grades are as follows.

Letter Grades and Points
Letter        Minimum Points Needed to Earn this Grade
A        94%
A-        90%

Tips for Success in GEOG 30N
Pay extra attention to course announcements
Read all the email announcements and read the whole announcement when you do. Unlike face-to-face courses where instructors have more diverse means to get your attention, online courses typically have email as the only channel through which you can get news and reminders. Not paying full attention to the emails may result in your missing deadlines and opportunities, which will be detrimental to your grade.

Participate
In order to make the most out of this opportunity, you will need to be actively involved in this course. 

Do the work on time
I see my role in this course as lead facilitator; that is, it is my job to help you achieve your educational objectives. I set deadlines to keep everyone on track to reach those goals. I think that if you do your best to adhere to those deadlines (for example, setting up a routine schedule when you work on the course), you will succeed. I strongly suggest setting a personal deadline that is earlier than the class deadline, which will help you avoid most issues that tend to cause delays. As described earlier in this syllabus, I am firm on deadlines. However, I do understand that emergencies may arise, and I am willing to work with you if I am informed (preferably ahead of time) and the reason was unavoidable.

Struggling? Get help!
There could be a case where you are paying full attention to the announcements and working hard for this course, but still somehow struggling. If this is you, please ask for help! The instructor can be a source of help. Let me know of your concerns (e.g., ways to improve your upcoming assignment) and the situations you want us to take into consideration when instructing and grading. Also, in case you didn't know, you can go to Penn State to get institutional yet individualized help! If you would like advice on writing, please go to Penn State Learning website for more resources (https://pennstatelearning.psu.edu/tutoring/writing [8]). They give you a range of tutoring options from online tutoring to in-person meetings by appointment.

Additional Course Policies
Academic Integrity
I will assume that everyone in the class will behave with integrity. As a student at Penn State, this goes beyond simply avoiding ""what you assume"" as lying and cheating, but accepting and adhering to what Penn State regards as academic integrity and violation of the value. You will have to actively study to be a person of integrity and remain as one. Penn State defines academic integrity as ""the pursuit of scholarly projects in an open, honest and responsible manner."" Academic integrity includes ""a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception."" In particular, the University defines plagiarism as ""the fabrication of information and citations; submitting others' work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other students' papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one's own."" I have zero tolerance for plagiarism, including self-plagiarism, and I will be checking for it. Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include course failure and I have observed students failing the course as a consequence. 

Academic Integrity Advice
Your violation being an ""honest mistake"" may help reduce the severity of your sanction, but it does NOT make your violation a non-violation. If you are really an honest person and made one mistake, you will naturally want to study to make sure you don't do it again. Penn State does have buffer measures for its members (e.g., your one-time breach will amount to nothing in terms of your career until you make two more breaches) but it does NOT have enough measures for those people who simply do not care if they repeat similar kind of mistakes or not.
Remaining a student of academic integrity needs active work. You need to study what academic integrity means to avoid violation of it. Individuals do NOT define what academic integrity is and what actions violate it. It is Penn State who defines it for its members. This is because individual opinions vary, and we cannot accommodate all. But as you understand the process of making Penn State policy, you will probably understand how the policies we have came to exist and what purposes they serve.
If in doubt, please consult official materials and relevant person(s) before taking any action.
You may collaborate before taking quizzes or submitting essays (working toward making an efficient summary of course materials), but you may not communicate anything related to quiz content in any form during the quiz with your coursemates or any person, or third-party website once the quiz questions are revealed to you. Similarly, you are not to share essay feedback with coursemates or third-party websites. 
Do not procure actual quiz questions from former takers of quizzes. Yes, it is a violation of academic integrity.
Nobody can stand in for you. Do not let any other person take any part of your quiz for you or lend knowledge of questions. This applies to you being the source of information.
Citation and Reference Style
In this course, you will be expected to follow a specific formatting guideline for your references. You should use Chicago Style or APA format for all citations done in all assignments in this class. You can see specific examples of how to cite different types of references (books, journal articles, website, etc.) by visiting the Chicago Manual of Style [9] reference guide or APA [10] style manual. Please make sure that you have selected 'Author/Date' not 'Notes and Bibliography' when reviewing the formatting guidelines. To make this process as easy as possible, you may use a free citation manager, such as Zotero [11], to collect, organize, and format your references.

You can also visit the ""Plagiarism"" section in Penn State's Academic Integrity training website [12] to learn more about how and when to cite.

Netiquette
The term ""Netiquette"" refers to the etiquette guidelines for electronic communications, such as email and bulletin board postings. Netiquette covers not only rules to maintain civility in discussions, but also special guidelines unique to the electronic nature of forum messages. Please review Virginia Shea's ""The Core Rules of Netiquette [13]"" for general guidelines that should be followed when communicating in this course. Most importantly, do not use slang, informal language, or text messaging jargon when communicating via email or when posting to the discussion board. Emails and posts should never begin with ""Hey"" or similarly informal language.

Penn State E-mail Accounts
All official communications from Penn State are sent to students' Penn State e-mail accounts. Be sure to check your Penn State account regularly, or forward your Penn State e-mail [14] to your preferred e-mail account, so you don't miss any important information.

Academic Integrity
This course follows the procedures for academic integrity [15] of Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. Penn State defines academic integrity as ""the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner."" Academic integrity includes ""a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception."" In particular, the University defines plagiarism as ""the fabrication of information and citations; submitting others' work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other students' papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one's own."" Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include course failure. To learn more, see Penn State's Academic Integrity Training for Students [16]. 

Course Copyright
All course materials students receive or to which students have online access are protected by copyright laws. Students may use course materials and make copies for their own use as needed, but unauthorized distribution and/or uploading of materials without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited. University Policy AD 40, the University Policy Recording of Classroom Activities and Note Taking Services addresses this issue. Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials may be held in violation of the University’s Code of Conduct, and/or liable under Federal and State laws.

For example, uploading completed labs, homework, or other assignments to any study site constitutes a violation of this policy.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Office for Student Disability Resources [17] website provides contact information for Campus Disability Coordinators [18]at every Penn State campus. For further information, please visit the Office for Student Disability Resources [17] website

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled. You will participate in an intake interview and provide documentation. See documentation guidelines at Applying for Services from Student Disability Resources [19]. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

Change in Normal Campus Operations
In case of weather-related delays or other emergency camps disruptions or closures at the University, this online course will proceed as planned. Your instructor will inform you if there are any extenuating circumstances regarding content or activity due dates in the course due to these delays or closures. If you are affected by a weather-related emergency, please contact your instructor at the earliest possible time to make special arrangements.

Reporting Educational Equity Concerns
Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated (Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance [20]) and can be reported through Educational Equity via Report Bias [21].

Counseling and Psychological Services
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional well-being.  The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings.  These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity, and sexual orientation.  Services include the following:

Counseling and Psychological Services at University Park  (CAPS) [22]: 814-863-0395
Counseling Services at Commonwealth Campuses [23]
Penn State Crisis Line (24 hours/7 days/week): 877-229-6400
Crisis Text Line (24 hours/7 days/week): Text LIONS to 741741

Military Personnel
Veterans and currently serving military personnel and/or spouses with unique circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill/duty requirements, disabilities, VA appointments, etc.) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor in the case that special arrangements need to be made.

Connect Online with Caution
Penn State is committed to educational access for all. Our students come from all walks of life and have diverse life experiences. As with any other online community, the lack of physical interaction in an online classroom can create a false sense of anonymity and security. While one can make new friends online, digital relationships can also be misleading. Good judgment and decision-making are critical when choosing to disclose personal information to others whom you do not know.

Technical Requirements
For this course, we recommend the minimum technical requirements outlined on the World Campus Technical Requirements [24] page, including the requirements listed for same-time, synchronous communications. If you need technical assistance at any point during the course, please contact the HelpDesk [25] (for World Campus students) or the IT Service Desk [26] (for students at all other campus locations).

Internet Connection
Access to a reliable Internet connection is required for this course. A problem with your Internet access may not be used as an excuse for late, missing, or incomplete coursework. If you experience problems with your Internet connection while working on this course, it is your responsibility to find an alternative Internet access point, such as a public library or Wi-Fi ® hotspot.

If you need additional technical assistance at any point during the course, please contact the HelpDesk [25] (for World Campus students) or the IT Service Desk [27] (for students at all other campus locations).
Deferred Grades
If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for reasons that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence of the instructor, following Penn State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40 [28]. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a written request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the instructor describing the reason(s) for the request. Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the final examination period.  It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the instructor to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy.  If for any reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade of ""F"" will be automatically entered on your transcript.

Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect
Penn State is “committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others” as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance [20]. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment and to interact with civility.

Mandated Reporting Statement
Penn State’s policies require me, as a faculty member, to share information about incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation) with Penn State’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to me in person or shared by students as part of their coursework. For more information regarding the University's policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual or gender-based harassment or misconduct, please visit Penn State's Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention & Response [34] website.

Additionally, I am required to make a report on any reasonable suspicion of child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law [35].

Welcome to GEOG 30N! We look forward to getting to know you this semester. Please take the time to read the entire syllabus. We share critical information here that will help you succeed in the course, especially regarding assignment expectations and due dates. 

This syllabus is divided into several sections. You can read it sequentially by scrolling down the length of the document.

This course takes place entirely online so please correspond via email. I will do my best to reply to emails within 48 hours. Before emailing with an administrative question, kindly check the course syllabus. As many students tend to have the same questions, you may find it more convenient to use the course Q&A discussion board in the course Canvas page (under Discussions). I will reply to these posts on a daily basis (excluding weekends).

Also, when sending an email or Canvas message, be sure to include at minimum: GEOG 30n in the subject, a salutation addressing me, and your name so I know who is contacting me.

Class Support Services
Penn State Online [1] offers online tutoring to World Campus students in math, writing, and some business classes. Tutoring and guided study groups for residential students are available through Penn State Learning [2].

Course Overview
GEOG 30N: Environment and Society in a Changing World (3 credits) GEOG 30N is an integrative study, inter-domain general education course. Students who started at Penn State prior to summer 2018 can apply these credits to either GS or GN requirements. The course also covers U.S. or international cultures requirements.

GEOG 30N can be applied toward Penn State's General Education(link is external) [3] ""Social and Behavioral Sciences"" (GS), ""Natural Sciences"" (GN), ""United States Cultures,"" or ""International Cultures"" (IL) requirements.

Prerequisites: None

This course introduces the study of sustainability and human-environment interactions from a geographic perspective. We examine both the influence of humanity on the environment and the influence of the environment on humanity, with attention to the sustainability of current human activities. We take a complex systems perspective on major environmental and societal challenges and examine linked human-environment issues in a variety of contexts. We emphasize the major individual and societal decisions which impact the environment and the ethical views implicit in the decisions. We explore key concepts such as scale, systems analysis, and individual and collective action, as well as various topical issues related to climate change, agriculture, biodiversity, and development. The key concepts above are cross-cutting and applicable to several topical issues; in turn, topical issues are strongly interrelated. By introducing cross-cutting key concepts and asking students to apply them across topical issues in human-environment systems familiar to them, this course encourages students to think both within and beyond the main topic of each unit, thereby integrating previous and new knowledge. Course assignments highlight both major themes in human-environment geography and the experience of what it is like to perform human-environment geography.

Where Is This Class Held/When Does It Meet?

All components of GEOG 30N will be conducted entirely on the World Wide Web. You do not have to be in University Park campus at any point of the course period or afterward for course completion, so long as you have reliable access to the Internet. There will be no set class meeting times, so students are responsible for setting aside time to complete the course work. 

How Is The Course Structured? 

There are 10 modules spread over three units that will be completed over the course of the 15-week semester. GEOG 30N will be conducted entirely on the World Wide Web. There will be no set class meeting times, so students are responsible for setting aside time to complete the course work. Each module contains readings, links, animations, movies, and novel explanations of the basic principles related to sustainability and human-environment systems. Each of the three units includes two writtten assignments and will conclude with an open book, on-line assessment. There is no final exam for this course in Fall 2022.

Written assignments are due approximately every two or three weeks. The deadline for the submission will always be on Friday's by 11:59 pm EST. You should plan ahead as these assignments require a deep grasp of the module material as well as independent research to complete. We recommend beginning work on them at least one week prior to the due date. Please check Canvas regularly to ensure that you are completing all written assignments and quizzes on time. Anything not completed by the due date at midnight will be considered late and will receive a point deduction.

Modules will be graded with feedback in a timely manner, generally during the 10 days following their submission. Due dates for the assignments must be strictly followed. An exception will only be made in case of an official, written documentation of a family or personal medical emergency. Lack of Internet access is NOT a valid exception. Do the work ahead of time and you should easily avoid this issue.

Late Exams will NOT be accepted

Note:
All components of this course will be conducted entirely online. You do not have to be in University Park campus at any point of the course period or afterward for course completion, so long as you have reliable access to the Internet.

What Do We Expect of You?
We expect that you will treat this course in the same manner you would a face-to-face section of an introductory level course. You should expect to spend the same amount of time on this course that you would spend in and out of class in your other courses. On average, that may be about eight hours per week. However, you will find your workload depends on your familiarity with the technology needed to take an online course and any past experience you have with the subject matter.

In our experience, the students who reach their goals in online courses are those that are able to motivate themselves to keep up with the coursework and those that take the opportunity to communicate with the instructor and their peers. We encourage you to ask as many questions as you would in a face-to-face class. If you are struggling with any aspect of the course, we can only help you if you ask.

Specific learning objectives for each module and assignment are detailed within each module.

Course Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes
Through completion of course modules, learning activities, and quizzes successful students will:

understand foundational principles of nature-society geography;
build a toolkit of key concepts and theories for analyzing human-environment systems;
evaluate how biophysical and social environments are intertwined and shape one another;
critique specific nature-society problems across a range of geographic contexts;
develop possible solutions for addressing contemporary sustainability challenges.
Required Course Materials
All (other) materials needed for this course are presented online through our course website and in Canvas. In order to access the online materials, you need to have an active Penn State Access Account user ID and password (used to access the online course resources). If you have any questions about obtaining or activating your Penn State Access Account, please contact  Penn State IT Service Desk [4] for World Campus students or  Penn State IT Get Support [5] (for students at all other campus locations).

Assignments and Grading
GEOG 30N will rely upon a variety of methods to assess and evaluate student learning, including:

Written Assignments provide you with an opportunity to synthesize the course concepts and supporting information you’ve learned in the class. These assignments will allow you to communicate your understanding of the material, demonstrate your critical thinking skills, and showcase your ability to analyze information. Each written assignment should be approximately 500-750 words in length, engage a minimum of three course concepts in bolded font, demonstrate quality academic writing skills, and include compelling arguments with supporting evidence. Rubrics are provided for each writing assignment to ensure the expectations for these assessments are clearly articulated to you.

Automated Quizzes will allow you to practice your mastery of the concepts presented in the course readings and supporting materials. There are three quizzes you will be required to participate in throughout the semester. Each quiz consists of approximately 25 questions and is open note. These assessments are autograded by Canvas, so you will receive your scores immediately upon submission of your quiz.

You will earn a grade that reflects the extent to which you achieve the course learning objectives listed above. Grades are assigned by the percentage of possible points earned in each module's activities. Below is a breakdown of each assignment's value as a percentage of the total course grade.

Breakdown of course assignments as points and a percentage of the total course grade
Assessment        Points        Total Points        % of Course Grade
Written Assignments (6)        50 points each        300        65%
Quizzes (3)        50 points each        150        35%
Total Possible                450        100%
Each assignment is worth 10% of your grade. I expect well-written assignments that demonstrate a strong grasp of the course material. For grading rubrics and tips for getting good grades on the written assignments and quizzes, please see the Assignments [6] page.

Make-up Exam Policy
We expect students to plan for and to take all quizzes and exams during the open period for each. In exceptional circumstances, make-up exams and quizzes will only be granted through the approval of the course instructor for legitimate and excused absences. Prior notification and approval for a make-up exam must be obtained by the student at least 72 hours prior to the scheduled exam. Special circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Curve
There is no grading curve in this course.

Late Policy
In exceptional circumstances, you should contact me, your instructor, Elise, at eaq10@psu.edu . The earlier you contact me to request a late submission, the better. Requests will be considered on a case by case basis. 

Late Written Assignments will be penalized at 10% per day. Activities more than seven days late automatically receive zero points. All assignments have precise (to the minute) deadlines that are understood in terms of Eastern Standard Time (EST) as applied in Penn State's resident campuses in Pennsylvania. Anything past the deadline is automatically late, even if it is just one minute late. Every 24 hours (to the minute) after the deadline, another day of late penalty is incurred.

Grades
We will use the Canvas gradebook to keep track of your grades. The minimum scores for course grades are as follows.

Letter Grades and Points
Letter        Minimum Points Needed to Earn this Grade
A        94%
A-        90%

Tips for Success in GEOG 30N
Pay extra attention to course announcements
Read all the email announcements and read the whole announcement when you do. Unlike face-to-face courses where instructors have more diverse means to get your attention, online courses typically have email as the only channel through which you can get news and reminders. Not paying full attention to the emails may result in your missing deadlines and opportunities, which will be detrimental to your grade.

Participate
In order to make the most out of this opportunity, you will need to be actively involved in this course. 

Do the work on time
I see my role in this course as lead facilitator; that is, it is my job to help you achieve your educational objectives. I set deadlines to keep everyone on track to reach those goals. I think that if you do your best to adhere to those deadlines (for example, setting up a routine schedule when you work on the course), you will succeed. I strongly suggest setting a personal deadline that is earlier than the class deadline, which will help you avoid most issues that tend to cause delays. As described earlier in this syllabus, I am firm on deadlines. However, I do understand that emergencies may arise, and I am willing to work with you if I am informed (preferably ahead of time) and the reason was unavoidable.

Struggling? Get help!
There could be a case where you are paying full attention to the announcements and working hard for this course, but still somehow struggling. If this is you, please ask for help! The instructor can be a source of help. Let me know of your concerns (e.g., ways to improve your upcoming assignment) and the situations you want us to take into consideration when instructing and grading. Also, in case you didn't know, you can go to Penn State to get institutional yet individualized help! If you would like advice on writing, please go to Penn State Learning website for more resources (https://pennstatelearning.psu.edu/tutoring/writing [8]). They give you a range of tutoring options from online tutoring to in-person meetings by appointment.

Additional Course Policies
Academic Integrity
I will assume that everyone in the class will behave with integrity. As a student at Penn State, this goes beyond simply avoiding ""what you assume"" as lying and cheating, but accepting and adhering to what Penn State regards as academic integrity and violation of the value. You will have to actively study to be a person of integrity and remain as one. Penn State defines academic integrity as ""the pursuit of scholarly projects in an open, honest and responsible manner."" Academic integrity includes ""a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception."" In particular, the University defines plagiarism as ""the fabrication of information and citations; submitting others' work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other students' papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one's own."" I have zero tolerance for plagiarism, including self-plagiarism, and I will be checking for it. Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include course failure and I have observed students failing the course as a consequence. 

Academic Integrity Advice
Your violation being an ""honest mistake"" may help reduce the severity of your sanction, but it does NOT make your violation a non-violation. If you are really an honest person and made one mistake, you will naturally want to study to make sure you don't do it again. Penn State does have buffer measures for its members (e.g., your one-time breach will amount to nothing in terms of your career until you make two more breaches) but it does NOT have enough measures for those people who simply do not care if they repeat similar kind of mistakes or not.
Remaining a student of academic integrity needs active work. You need to study what academic integrity means to avoid violation of it. Individuals do NOT define what academic integrity is and what actions violate it. It is Penn State who defines it for its members. This is because individual opinions vary, and we cannot accommodate all. But as you understand the process of making Penn State policy, you will probably understand how the policies we have came to exist and what purposes they serve.
If in doubt, please consult official materials and relevant person(s) before taking any action.
You may collaborate before taking quizzes or submitting essays (working toward making an efficient summary of course materials), but you may not communicate anything related to quiz content in any form during the quiz with your coursemates or any person, or third-party website once the quiz questions are revealed to you. Similarly, you are not to share essay feedback with coursemates or third-party websites. 
Do not procure actual quiz questions from former takers of quizzes. Yes, it is a violation of academic integrity.
Nobody can stand in for you. Do not let any other person take any part of your quiz for you or lend knowledge of questions. This applies to you being the source of information.
Citation and Reference Style
In this course, you will be expected to follow a specific formatting guideline for your references. You should use Chicago Style or APA format for all citations done in all assignments in this class. You can see specific examples of how to cite different types of references (books, journal articles, website, etc.) by visiting the Chicago Manual of Style [9] reference guide or APA [10] style manual. Please make sure that you have selected 'Author/Date' not 'Notes and Bibliography' when reviewing the formatting guidelines. To make this process as easy as possible, you may use a free citation manager, such as Zotero [11], to collect, organize, and format your references.

You can also visit the ""Plagiarism"" section in Penn State's Academic Integrity training website [12] to learn more about how and when to cite.

Netiquette
The term ""Netiquette"" refers to the etiquette guidelines for electronic communications, such as email and bulletin board postings. Netiquette covers not only rules to maintain civility in discussions, but also special guidelines unique to the electronic nature of forum messages. Please review Virginia Shea's ""The Core Rules of Netiquette [13]"" for general guidelines that should be followed when communicating in this course. Most importantly, do not use slang, informal language, or text messaging jargon when communicating via email or when posting to the discussion board. Emails and posts should never begin with ""Hey"" or similarly informal language.

Penn State E-mail Accounts
All official communications from Penn State are sent to students' Penn State e-mail accounts. Be sure to check your Penn State account regularly, or forward your Penn State e-mail [14] to your preferred e-mail account, so you don't miss any important information.

Academic Integrity
This course follows the procedures for academic integrity [15] of Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. Penn State defines academic integrity as ""the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner."" Academic integrity includes ""a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception."" In particular, the University defines plagiarism as ""the fabrication of information and citations; submitting others' work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other students' papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one's own."" Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include course failure. To learn more, see Penn State's Academic Integrity Training for Students [16]. 

Course Copyright
All course materials students receive or to which students have online access are protected by copyright laws. Students may use course materials and make copies for their own use as needed, but unauthorized distribution and/or uploading of materials without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited. University Policy AD 40, the University Policy Recording of Classroom Activities and Note Taking Services addresses this issue. Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials may be held in violation of the University’s Code of Conduct, and/or liable under Federal and State laws.

For example, uploading completed labs, homework, or other assignments to any study site constitutes a violation of this policy.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Office for Student Disability Resources [17] website provides contact information for Campus Disability Coordinators [18]at every Penn State campus. For further information, please visit the Office for Student Disability Resources [17] website

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled. You will participate in an intake interview and provide documentation. See documentation guidelines at Applying for Services from Student Disability Resources [19]. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

Change in Normal Campus Operations
In case of weather-related delays or other emergency camps disruptions or closures at the University, this online course will proceed as planned. Your instructor will inform you if there are any extenuating circumstances regarding content or activity due dates in the course due to these delays or closures. If you are affected by a weather-related emergency, please contact your instructor at the earliest possible time to make special arrangements.

Reporting Educational Equity Concerns
Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated (Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance [20]) and can be reported through Educational Equity via Report Bias [21].

Counseling and Psychological Services
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional well-being.  The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings.  These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity, and sexual orientation.  Services include the following:

Counseling and Psychological Services at University Park  (CAPS) [22]: 814-863-0395
Counseling Services at Commonwealth Campuses [23]
Penn State Crisis Line (24 hours/7 days/week): 877-229-6400
Crisis Text Line (24 hours/7 days/week): Text LIONS to 741741

Military Personnel
Veterans and currently serving military personnel and/or spouses with unique circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill/duty requirements, disabilities, VA appointments, etc.) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor in the case that special arrangements need to be made.

Connect Online with Caution
Penn State is committed to educational access for all. Our students come from all walks of life and have diverse life experiences. As with any other online community, the lack of physical interaction in an online classroom can create a false sense of anonymity and security. While one can make new friends online, digital relationships can also be misleading. Good judgment and decision-making are critical when choosing to disclose personal information to others whom you do not know.

Technical Requirements
For this course, we recommend the minimum technical requirements outlined on the World Campus Technical Requirements [24] page, including the requirements listed for same-time, synchronous communications. If you need technical assistance at any point during the course, please contact the HelpDesk [25] (for World Campus students) or the IT Service Desk [26] (for students at all other campus locations).

Internet Connection
Access to a reliable Internet connection is required for this course. A problem with your Internet access may not be used as an excuse for late, missing, or incomplete coursework. If you experience problems with your Internet connection while working on this course, it is your responsibility to find an alternative Internet access point, such as a public library or Wi-Fi ® hotspot.

If you need additional technical assistance at any point during the course, please contact the HelpDesk [25] (for World Campus students) or the IT Service Desk [27] (for students at all other campus locations).
Deferred Grades
If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for reasons that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence of the instructor, following Penn State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40 [28]. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a written request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the instructor describing the reason(s) for the request. Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the final examination period.  It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the instructor to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy.  If for any reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade of ""F"" will be automatically entered on your transcript.

Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect
Penn State is “committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others” as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance [20].

January 13 - 17

The first week is an introduction to the course and the online tools you will be using. Be sure your access account is working. Sign up for Web space and be sure you know how to post to your PASS space. (All your course work files should be in the www folder in your PASS Space.) If you don't have a personal home page up, make a simple one which can be revised later and have it available from your PSU address - mine is http://www.personal.psu.edu/jxm22, yours will be the same using your userid where I have mine, jxm22. If you already have site at that address, link your course page to that page. This is your first assignment.

There are many Web editors, both free and commercial. You can also do all your Web markup in a text editor, like NotePad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac) or free editors like Komodo (Windows, Mac, Linux), TextWrangler (Mac), NoteTab (PC), HTML-Kit (PC), jEdit and Sublime Text (Linux, Mac, Windows). All are free downloads. And there are many others, especially for Windows, just search for them. An excellent WYSIWYG editor, Dreamweaver, is available in most of the campus labs.

Please don't use a word processing program like MS Word or WordPerfect, saving your files as HTML, nor the web editor Front Page. They introduce a lot of unnecessary markup which makes the files hard to edit in a text editor.

Go through the HTML tutorial.

  Description
HIST 020 is designed to introduce students to the main events and themes of American history before 1877. This course is not intended to simply acquaint the student with facts, but to teach them how to analyze those facts so that they can understand why historical events in America unfolded as they did. A larger goal of the course is to teach them how to think ""historically"" and to perceive the relevance of the past to the present. It is impossible to understand either yourself or your society if you cannot identify the role which your individual and collective past plays in the construction of your actions and thoughts today. The course provides the student with a basic background in American History prior to 1877. HIST 021 chronologically follows this course by providing the student with a background in American History from 1877 to the present. HIST 020 is a prerequisite for upper-division courses in American History, and is a required course for the History major.
Objectives
At the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Identify major themes of American history from 1607 to 1877.
2. Discuss social and ideological diversity in the American experience. 3. Analyze critically major events in American history.
Organization
This course is made up of 15 lessons divided into 3 modules.
For a typical lesson, you will complete the following activities and assignments:
Explore the online lectures for each lesson.
Read the assigned chapters from the textbook and readings.
Complete the weekly assignments (discussions and commentaries) by the due dates listed on the course calendar.
In addition, you will participate in three online group discussions. You will be placed in small groups and you will debate opposing positions over a week-long discussion.
Finally, there are 3 exam papers throughout the semester.

 Online Learning and Attendance
This course has been developed to promote asynchronous learning. The instructor and students do NOT meet on a designated day and time each week. For each lesson, there is a timeframe to complete all activities and assignments, and you may work at your own pace within that timeframe. However, you must adhere to the due dates outlined on the Calendar. (Due dates can also be viewed under the Syllabus tab.) You should log into the course daily to check for updates, review lessons, and participate in activities.
Texts and Other Materials
There are five required texts.

  Group Discussions 30
  Exam Papers 40
  Total 100
  Lesson Commentary Discussions and Commentary Feedbacks (30% of grade)
This regular assignment will prompt you to write down your analysis of significant aspects of the weekly readings. It serves as replacement for in-class discussions in a regular on-campus class. You will post your assignment in the appropriate discussion forum, so that other course participants can review and comment on your ideas and thoughts. Your posts will be graded on an individual basis, but do not be afraid to make mistakes and to think freely when it comes to your contributions – errors will not be held against you (300-400 words each). By the end of each week, you will also submit a feedback commentary on one of the lesson commentaries submitted that week by another student in the course (150-250 words each).
Unless noted otherwise, Lesson Commentaries must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. on the day noted on the course calendar. Unless noted otherwise, Lesson Commentary Feedback assignments must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. on the day noted on the course calendar. Note: Lesson Commentary Feedback assignments (or replies to Lesson Commentaries) are generally due a few days after the initial post for the Lesson Commentary assignments.

 For further information on the Lesson Commentary Discussions/Postings and Commentary Feedbacks, see Guidelines for Lesson Commentaries in the Orientation module.
The lowest commentary discussion and commentary feedback scores will be dropped.
Group Discussions (30% of grade)
Students will participate in three online group discussions, one at the end of each module. In preparation for this assignment, you will each be named to a special team comprised of around ten members. Over the course of the week-long discussion, each team will debate from two competing positions.
At the outset of the group discussion (starting Sunday), the instructor will select several members of each team to support the first position, and several members of each team to support the second position. You will be notified which side you are at the beginning.
The debate will go through two phases:
The first phase will take place for several days. By 11:59PM of the last day for the first phase, each member of your team will have posted an initial statement of 300-350 words, making the case in support of his or her proposition.
The second phase of the discussion will last several more days. By 11:59 of the last day for the second phase. each participant should post a statement of 200-250 words, responding to an argument made by a team member from the opposing side.
In formulating your postings, illustrate your points with examples from the assigned text for that week; and, where pertinent, from other assigned readings in the course.
You can find further information on each Group Discussion in the corresponding lesson.
Consult the Course Calendar and/or the Assignments Table at the bottom of the course syllabus for due dates.
Exam Papers (40% of grade)
There are three exam papers made up of two random questions pulled, three days in advance of the due date, from five to seven review questions
(800-1,000 words each).
Consult the Course Calendar and/or the Assignments Table at the bottom of the course syllabus for due dates.
   Discussion Policies
Written communication is different than oral communication. The policies and pointers listed below cover common issues that crop up in an online discussion forum. They are designed to enhance organization, help you convey your ideas more clearly, and prevent misunderstandings.
1. Try to think of discussion forums as an extension of your real-life classroom.
a. Endeavor to share ideas among your classmates, not to prove that you are right and they are wrong.
b. Be aware that differences of opinion are going to occur in any forum. Multiple perspectives on a topic or problem are often valuable.
2. Compose long messages in NotePad (or TextEdit) and then copy/paste into Canvas. Or add an attachment and provide a simple explanation of its contents.
3. Keep closely related ideas organized under a single post.
a. To respond to the original post, click in the Reply field, type your response, and click Post Reply. Title your post so that individuals know
what your post is about. The title of your post should be a brief phrase that summarizes your post.
b. To respond to another individual, click the Reply button just below the individual's original response. Type in your response and then click
Post Reply.
c. To express a new idea, click in the Reply field again, similar to adding your original post. Remember to add a title.
d. Don’t feel obligated to make a reply to a post if you feel it does not warrant one. Numerous posts that contain no essential new ideas may
create more work for everyone.
e. Don’t be offended if no one replies to your message. Often people will read postings on a discussion forum but not make a reply.
4. Act
a. Remember that not everyone comes from the same background, or shares the same values and ideals as you.
b. Be mindful of your “tone.” If you are unsure of your tone, try reading your discussion forum post out loud before you submit it. When you
read it out loud, does it sound the way you would speak to another student in the classroom?
c. Remember that a message can easily be misunderstood. Making a joke or being ironic in a discussion forum is a great way to break the ice,
but you have to let people know your intentions. If you wish to convey a humorous tone, try using emoticons or adding comments like “Just
kidding!” Do not use slang.
5. Alert your instructor as soon as possible if there is a message on the discussion forum that strikes you as inappropriate or offensive.
a. Keep in mind that the author may not realize how the message “sounds” to you. Try to think of the situation as a growth opportunity facilitated by the instructor.
professionally and be considerate of others.

 b. Allow the instructor to handle the situation. Rest assured that your instructor is determined to prevent breakdown of group process.
c. Be aware that the instructor has the right to remove any inappropriate or offensive messages.
d. Be aware that any student who posts an inappropriate of offensive message will be blocked from participating in the discussion forum and
will receive an F for that assignment. Students are also subject to relevant policies in the student code of conduct.

  Description
HIST 020 is designed to introduce students to the main events and themes of American history before 1877. This course is not intended to simply acquaint the student with facts, but to teach them how to analyze those facts so that they can understand why historical events in America unfolded as they did. A larger goal of the course is to teach them how to think ""historically"" and to perceive the relevance of the past to the present. It is impossible to understand either yourself or your society if you cannot identify the role which your individual and collective past plays in the construction of your actions and thoughts today. The course provides the student with a basic background in American History prior to 1877. HIST 021 chronologically follows this course by providing the student with a background in American History from 1877 to the present. HIST 020 is a prerequisite for upper-division courses in American History, and is a required course for the History major.
Objectives
At the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Identify major themes of American history from 1607 to 1877.
2. Discuss social and ideological diversity in the American experience. 3. Analyze critically major events in American history.
Organization
This course is made up of 15 lessons divided into 3 modules.
For a typical lesson, you will complete the following activities and assignments:
Explore the online lectures for each lesson.
Read the assigned chapters from the textbook and readings.
Complete the weekly assignments (discussions and commentaries) by the due dates listed on the course calendar.
In addition, you will participate in three online group discussions. You will be placed in small groups and you will debate opposing positions over a week-long discussion.
Finally, there are 3 exam papers throughout the semester.

 Online Learning and Attendance
This course has been developed to promote asynchronous learning. The instructor and students do NOT meet on a designated day and time each week. For each lesson, there is a timeframe to complete all activities and assignments, and you may work at your own pace within that timeframe. However, you must adhere to the due dates outlined on the Calendar. (Due dates can also be viewed under the Syllabus tab.) You should log into the course daily to check for updates, review lessons, and participate in activities.
Texts and Other Materials

  Lesson Commentaries/Commentary Feedback 30
  Group Discussions 30
  Exam Papers 40
  Total 100
  Lesson Commentary Discussions and Commentary Feedbacks (30% of grade)
This regular assignment will prompt you to write down your analysis of significant aspects of the weekly readings. It serves as replacement for in-class discussions in a regular on-campus class. You will post your assignment in the appropriate discussion forum, so that other course participants can review and comment on your ideas and thoughts. Your posts will be graded on an individual basis, but do not be afraid to make mistakes and to think freely when it comes to your contributions – errors will not be held against you (300-400 words each). By the end of each week, you will also submit a feedback commentary on one of the lesson commentaries submitted that week by another student in the course (150-250 words each).
Unless noted otherwise, Lesson Commentaries must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. on the day noted on the course calendar. Unless noted otherwise, Lesson Commentary Feedback assignments must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. on the day noted on the course calendar. Note: Lesson Commentary Feedback assignments (or replies to Lesson Commentaries) are generally due a few days after the initial post for the Lesson Commentary assignments.

 For further information on the Lesson Commentary Discussions/Postings and Commentary Feedbacks, see Guidelines for Lesson Commentaries in the Orientation module.
The lowest commentary discussion and commentary feedback scores will be dropped.
Group Discussions (30% of grade)
Students will participate in three online group discussions, one at the end of each module. In preparation for this assignment, you will each be named to a special team comprised of around ten members. Over the course of the week-long discussion, each team will debate from two competing positions.
At the outset of the group discussion (starting Sunday), the instructor will select several members of each team to support the first position, and several members of each team to support the second position. You will be notified which side you are at the beginning.
The debate will go through two phases:
The first phase will take place for several days. By 11:59PM of the last day for the first phase, each member of your team will have posted an initial statement of 300-350 words, making the case in support of his or her proposition.
The second phase of the discussion will last several more days. By 11:59 of the last day for the second phase. each participant should post a statement of 200-250 words, responding to an argument made by a team member from the opposing side.
In formulating your postings, illustrate your points with examples from the assigned text for that week; and, where pertinent, from other assigned readings in the course.
You can find further information on each Group Discussion in the corresponding lesson.
Consult the Course Calendar and/or the Assignments Table at the bottom of the course syllabus for due dates.
Exam Papers (40% of grade)
There are three exam papers made up of two random questions pulled, three days in advance of the due date, from five to seven review questions
(800-1,000 words each).
Consult the Course Calendar and/or the Assignments Table at the bottom of the course syllabus for due dates.
   Discussion Policies
Written communication is different than oral communication. The policies and pointers listed below cover common issues that crop up in an online discussion forum. They are designed to enhance organization, help you convey your ideas more clearly, and prevent misunderstandings.
1. Try to think of discussion forums as an extension of your real-life classroom.
a. Endeavor to share ideas among your classmates, not to prove that you are right and they are wrong.
b. Be aware that differences of opinion are going to occur in any forum. Multiple perspectives on a topic or problem are often valuable.
2. Compose long messages in NotePad (or TextEdit) and then copy/paste into Canvas. Or add an attachment and provide a simple explanation of its contents.
3. Keep closely related ideas organized under a single post.
a. To respond to the original post, click in the Reply field, type your response, and click Post Reply. Title your post so that individuals know
what your post is about. The title of your post should be a brief phrase that summarizes your post.
b. To respond to another individual, click the Reply button just below the individual's original response. Type in your response and then click
Post Reply.
c. To express a new idea, click in the Reply field again, similar to adding your original post. Remember to add a title.
d. Don’t feel obligated to make a reply to a post if you feel it does not warrant one. Numerous posts that contain no essential new ideas may
create more work for everyone.
e. Don’t be offended if no one replies to your message. Often people will read postings on a discussion forum but not make a reply.
4. Act
a. Remember that not everyone comes from the same background, or shares the same values and ideals as you.
b. Be mindful of your “tone.” If you are unsure of your tone, try reading your discussion forum post out loud before you submit it. When you
read it out loud, does it sound the way you would speak to another student in the classroom?
c. Remember that a message can easily be misunderstood. Making a joke or being ironic in a discussion forum is a great way to break the ice,
but you have to let people know your intentions. If you wish to convey a humorous tone, try using emoticons or adding comments like “Just
kidding!” Do not use slang.
5. Alert your instructor as soon as possible if there is a message on the discussion forum that strikes you as inappropriate or offensive.
a. Keep in mind that the author may not realize how the message “sounds” to you. Try to think of the situation as a growth opportunity facilitated by the instructor.
professionally and be considerate of others.

 b. Allow the instructor to handle the situation. Rest assured that your instructor is determined to prevent breakdown of group process.
c. Be aware that the instructor has the right to remove any inappropriate or offensive messages.
d. Be aware that any student who posts an inappropriate of offensive message will be blocked from participating in the discussion forum and
will receive an F for that assignment. Students are also subject to relevant policies in the student code of conduct.

ASSIGNMENT CATEGORY
Percent
  Lesson Commentaries/Commentary Feedback 30
  Group Discussions 30
  Exam Papers 40
  Total 100
  Lesson Commentary Discussions and Commentary Feedbacks (30% of grade)
This regular assignment will prompt you to write down your analysis of significant aspects of the weekly readings. It serves as replacement for in-class discussions in a regular on-campus class. You will post your assignment in the appropriate discussion forum, so that other course participants can review and comment on your ideas and thoughts. Your posts will be graded on an individual basis, but do not be afraid to make mistakes and to think freely when it comes to your contributions – errors will not be held against you (300-400 words each). By the end of each week, you will also submit a feedback commentary on one of the lesson commentaries submitted that week by another student in the course (150-250 words each).
Unless noted otherwise, Lesson Commentaries must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. on the day noted on the course calendar. Unless noted otherwise, Lesson Commentary Feedback assignments must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. on the day noted on the course calendar. Note: Lesson Commentary Feedback assignments (or replies to Lesson Commentaries) are generally due a few days after the initial post for the Lesson Commentary assignments.

 For further information on the Lesson Commentary Discussions/Postings and Commentary Feedbacks, see Guidelines for Lesson Commentaries in the Orientation module.
The lowest commentary discussion and commentary feedback scores will be dropped.
Group Discussions (30% of grade)
Students will participate in three online group discussions, one at the end of each module. In preparation for this assignment, you will each be named to a special team comprised of around ten members. Over the course of the week-long discussion, each team will debate from two competing positions.
At the outset of the group discussion (starting Sunday), the instructor will select several members of each team to support the first position, and several members of each team to support the second position. You will be notified which side you are at the beginning.
The debate will go through two phases:
The first phase will take place for several days. By 11:59PM of the last day for the first phase, each member of your team will have posted an initial statement of 300-350 words, making the case in support of his or her proposition.
The second phase of the discussion will last several more days. By 11:59 of the last day for the second phase. each participant should post a statement of 200-250 words, responding to an argument made by a team member from the opposing side.
In formulating your postings, illustrate your points with examples from the assigned text for that week; and, where pertinent, from other assigned readings in the course.
You can find further information on each Group Discussion in the corresponding lesson.
Consult the Course Calendar and/or the Assignments Table at the bottom of the course syllabus for due dates.
Exam Papers (40% of grade)
There are three exam papers made up of two random questions pulled, three days in advance of the due date, from five to seven review questions
(800-1,000 words each).
Consult the Course Calendar and/or the Assignments Table at the bottom of the course syllabus for due dates.
   Discussion Policies
Written communication is different than oral communication. The policies and pointers listed below cover common issues that crop up in an online discussion forum. They are designed to enhance organization, help you convey your ideas more clearly, and prevent misunderstandings.
1. Try to think of discussion forums as an extension of your real-life classroom.
a. Endeavor to share ideas among your classmates, not to prove that you are right and they are wrong.
b. Be aware that differences of opinion are going to occur in any forum. Multiple perspectives on a topic or problem are often valuable.
2. Compose long messages in NotePad (or TextEdit) and then copy/paste into Canvas. Or add an attachment and provide a simple explanation of its contents.
3. Keep closely related ideas organized under a single post.
a. To respond to the original post, click in the Reply field, type your response, and click Post Reply. Title your post so that individuals know
what your post is about. The title of your post should be a brief phrase that summarizes your post.
b. To respond to another individual, click the Reply button just below the individual's original response. Type in your response and then click
Post Reply.
c. To express a new idea, click in the Reply field again, similar to adding your original post. Remember to add a title.
d. Don’t feel obligated to make a reply to a post if you feel it does not warrant one. Numerous posts that contain no essential new ideas may
create more work for everyone.
e. Don’t be offended if no one replies to your message. Often people will read postings on a discussion forum but not make a reply.
4. Act
a. Remember that not everyone comes from the same background, or shares the same values and ideals as you.
b. Be mindful of your “tone.” If you are unsure of your tone, try reading your discussion forum post out loud before you submit it. When you
read it out loud, does it sound the way you would speak to another student in the classroom?
c. Remember that a message can easily be misunderstood. Making a joke or being ironic in a discussion forum is a great way to break the ice,
but you have to let people know your intentions. If you wish to convey a humorous tone, try using emoticons or adding comments like “Just
kidding!” Do not use slang.
5. Alert your instructor as soon as possible if there is a message on the discussion forum that strikes you as inappropriate or offensive.
a. Keep in mind that the author may not realize how the message “sounds” to you. Try to think of the situation as a growth opportunity facilitated by the instructor.
professionally and be considerate of others.

 b. Allow the instructor to handle the situation. Rest assured that your instructor is determined to prevent breakdown of group process.
c. Be aware that the instructor has the right to remove any inappropriate or offensive messages.
d. Be aware that any student who posts an inappropriate of offensive message will be blocked from participating in the discussion forum and
will receive an F for that assignment. Students are also subject to relevant policies in the student code of conduct.
 University Policies
Academic Integrity
Penn State defines academic integrity as the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. All students should act with personal integrity, respect other students' dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.
Dishonesty of any kind will not be tolerated in this course. Dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students. Students who are found to be dishonest will receive academic sanctions and will be reported to the University's Judicial Affairs office for possible further disciplinary sanction. For further information, please read University Faculty Senate Policy 49-20 at http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00- grades/#49-20 (http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#49-20) .

If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.
Counseling and Psychological Services

WHERE DOES THE CLASS MEET?
In Person: 100 Thomas Building
Online: www.youtube.com/soc119/live
TAKING SOC 119 ONLINE OR IN PERSON – WHAT IS POSSIBLE?
Can I take SOC 119 online?
● At this point, we are organizing the class around the idea that everyone will
attend class in person in 100 Thomas Building on Tuesdays and Thursdays at
4:35 – 5:50pm.
What if I cannot attend class?
● Like every other pre-Covid19 semester of SOC 119, students receive points for
being in class because attendance is an “assignment.”
● If you miss class, then you still must make up those points. Even if you have a
valid excuse (medical, academic, personal situation), you will need to make up
those points because attendance is an “assignment.”
How do I make up attendance points when I miss a class?
● You can watch the livestream or a recording of the class and take a Lecture
Attendance Quiz on Canvas afterwards.
● Each class has a Lecture Attendance Quiz associated with it that we activate
within the hour after class ends.
● However, do not attend class and sign the attendance sheet AND then also take
the Lecture Attendance Quiz on Canvas.
How many times during the semester can I NOT come to 100 Thomas for the
in-person class?
● You can watch the livestream or recording instead of attending class on THREE
different occasions throughout the semester.
● Remember, after watching the recording you must take the Lecture Attendance
quiz on Canvas to earn the attendance points.
What happens if I have to take more than THREE of the Lecture Attendance
Quizzes because I’m not in 100 Thomas on more than three occasions?
● After the first three, you can only earn half credit for those attendance points –
even if you take the Lecture Attendance Quizzes and earn all of the points.
What if I get Covid-19 during the semester? Or what if I must go into quarantine?
Or what if I cannot attend class for an extended period because I have
encountered some other issue?
● If you are diagnosed with Covid-19, then as long as we have an email from Penn
State, you will receive another TWO opportunities to not come to class. (You still
have to watch the class and take the Lecture Attendance Quiz, however.)
● So keep in mind that if you decide that you don’t feel like coming to class and so
you stay home, this reduces your flexibility for deciding that you want to miss
class for some random reason later in the semester.
● That said, we will follow Penn State guidelines, just like we do for any extended
illness when instructors are asked to allow students to make up work that they
have missed.
How do I receive attendance credit when I am in 100 Thomas?
● We will take attendance manually by passing around an attendance sheet –
beginning on Tuesday of the second week.
● During the first week, there are no attendance points calculated in Canvas.
Attendance sheets are Old School. I can just sign the name of my friend.
● You can do that. However, we’ve found students to be really bad at forging
names. And besides, we compare signatures, so you’ll probably get caught.
● Cheating is a violation of Penn State policy and it goes on a person’s permanent
record. That sucks.
What should I do if I am sick?
● You can stay home and watch the stream (if you’re feeling well enough) or watch
the recording of the class.
● Each time you do this, however, it counts as one of your THREE opportunities to
not come to 100 Thomas for the class.
What if I am immunocompromised and I want to take SOC 119 as an online
course?
● Reach out to us and then we will consult with Penn State and get back to you.
(staff@soc119.org).
● HOWEVER, you have to do this during the first week of classes.
What if I am an international student and at the last minute, I have decided not to
risk coming to University Park? Do I need to drop the SOC 119 class?
● Reach out to us and tell us of your plans. We will consult with Penn State and
then get back in touch with you. (staff@soc119.org).
● HOWEVER, you have to do this during the first week of classes.
What if I arrive late at 100 Thomas?
● If you are more than ten minutes (10 min) late, then you need to check in with the
attendance TA who is sitting in the back of the room at the top in the middle
(under the projectors). You will receive partial credit that day for class.
What if I am in class and I need to leave before it ends?
● We will have a TA in the back of the room and this person will have the
attendance sheet. See them as you are exiting the room.
● You will receive partial credit that day for class.
Can I just stay home and watch the SOC 119 live stream instead of coming to the
Thomas Building?
● Yes, but each time that you do this will count as one of your THREE opportunities
to miss the in-person class.
● FYI: SOC 119 is streamed on YouTube every T/R @4:35-5:50pm. We will make
sure that you have the links
Are there any days during the semester when class will be canceled?
● At this point, you will be watching videos of previous SOC 119 classes on
four days (October 18, 20, 25, 27).
● So on these days, you will NOT come to 100 Thomas – BUT YOU WILL WATCH
A VIDEO AND TAKE THE LECTURE ATTENDANCE QUIZ (see below)
● If we do “cancel” an additional class in 100 Thomas, then you will still have to
watch an online class video and take a Lecture Attendance Quiz on Canvas.
● A “canceled” class does not count as one of your THREE opportunities to miss
the in-person class.
What if we have a snow day and class is canceled?
● You will still have to watch an online class video and take the Lecture Attendance
Quiz in Canvas.
● That video will be sent to you and be somewhere on Canvas or by email.
How do I receive attendance credit when I am watching the livestream or the
recordings?
● Each class will have an associated Lecture Attendance Quiz in Canvas that you
will take AFTER you watch the livestream or the recording. The quiz will have
questions pertaining to the class.
● These Lecture Attendance Quizzes on Canvas will be available shortly after each
class period. (Unfortunately, we can only say that we’ll try to have the questions
finished within the hour.)
● Remember, you can only take THREE of these throughout the semester.
● After THREE times that you’re absent from 100 Thomas, then you can only
receive half-credit for your attendance points.
● Again, this policy changes if you are diagnosed with Covid-19.
If I miss a class and I’m not watching the live stream, then how long do I have
before I must watch the recording?
● The Lecture Attendance Quiz on Canvas will be open for exactly three weeks
after the end of each class.
How will my attendance points be calculated?
● We will add up your points derived from the in-person attendance sheets and add
them to your points from the Lecture Attendance Quizzes that you take on
Canvas (i.e., the days that you were not in class)
● For the first THREE Lecture Attendance Quizzes you can earn full credit but any
remaining quizzes can only earn you half credit.
● Remember, don’t come to class AND take the Canvas quiz on the same day.
How do I keep track of my attendance points?
● We do not give you weekly notifications of your attendance grades that are
generated from the attendance sheets.
● So you have to keep track on your own and it is simple: If you miss class and
have to take the Lecture Attendance Quiz, then put THAT particular class (date)
on your to-do list.
How can I contact Sam or Yuli to address anything I need in the course?
● We are available to respond to all class questions or issues ONLY at the
staff@soc119.org email address.
● DO NOT send emails via Canvas because we likely never respond to messages
on those accounts so you will not receive a timely response.
WHAT IS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE COURSE?
To inspire you to think on your own terms regarding whatever it is we end up talking about in
class. We shift the specific topics every semester according to what is in the news and what
people are thinking about. Notice that the objective of the course is not to get you to think in
any particular way, and it is certainly not to “teach” you something. Sam does not believe in
“teaching” – his role is to stimulate you to think on your own terms.
HOW CAN I SEE MY GRADES?
Packback: Follow your progress on your personal Packback page:
● Click on ""Track My Own Participation"" in the blue box on the right
● Click on “Discussion Posts” below the gray box and then scroll down to see each post
that you have done
World in Conversation: Follow your progress on the WinC landing page when you’re logged in
Lecture Attendance Quizzes: You cannot keep track of which quizzes you have done or still
have to do on Canvas. Just keep track on your own. Again, if you miss class and have to
take the Lecture Attendance Quiz, then put THAT particular class (date) on your to-do list.
Readings and Videos Quizzes: These scores auto-populate in the Canvas gradebook
Syllabus Quiz: These scores auto-populate in the Canvas gradebook
EARN EXTRA CREDIT
You can earn ONE extra credit point each day that you are selected to be a Case Study
volunteer.
You only receive the point if we select you as a Case Study volunteer and not simply by filling
out the volunteer questionnaire.
You do NOT receive extra credit by randomly raising your hand and asking a question or
making a comment during class.
We will keep track and we will add the points to your Canvas grade at the end of the
semester.
The maximum extra credit you can earn is TWO points.
You must fill out the volunteer survey and sign the Case Study Volunteer consent form to
volunteer and receive the extra credit.
TO VOLUNTEER: Volunteer — SOC 119

CURIOSITY SCORE:
In order to receive full points for these assignments, your Curiosity Score must be above the
minimum threshold:
● 80 for the Question-Answer submissions
● 70 for the Response submissions
MINIMUM WORD REQUIREMENT:
● 300 for the Question-Answer submissions
● 150 for the Response submissions
Here are a few things to ensure that you reach the CS thresholds of 80/70:
● Do not have spelling errors
● Use paragraphs and make sure you write at least 300 words for new questions/answers
and 150 for a response
● Include the link to the SOC 119 class YouTube video that you are commenting on while
writing your Question/Answer by clicking on the “Insert Video” tab (do not just put it in
the middle of your text)
● There are no half credit responses, so you will either receive FULL points or ZERO
points for your efforts
IF YOUR CURIOSITY SCORE IS LESS THAN 80/70, JUST CLICK ON THE “OPTIONS”
TAB AND EDIT YOUR SUBMISSION.
You cannot edit your submission if someone has commented on it. If that happens, then
just copy what you wrote and resubmit it with the changes that you want to make. So,
for that week you will have two submissions and that is fine.
TWELVE - Question-Answer Submissions – 24 points
You submit twelve (12) of these assignments – one each week. You can forget to submit
assignments for two different weeks and you are still good and will not miss those points
because in week fourteen week of the semester you can make up TWO of your missed
assignments. If you miss more than two, then you are out of luck because the system will only
give you credit for UP TO 4 POINTS for two of these assignments during that week.
You receive TWO (2) points for each Question-Answer submission with a Curiosity Score at 80
or above.
Each week you will select a segment from the lecture that sparks a question in you. On the
Packback platform, you will type in the question and provide the video link from the SOC 119
lecture that points to the part of the class that addresses your question. Then you are going to
answer your own question in a minimum of 300 words. So, each submission will have three
parts to it:
1. Your question
2. A “lecture video” link that you will get from the SOC 119 website (www.soc119.org)
3. Your 300-word response to your own question
If you want, you can include another source in the Source box at the bottom, but definitely, you
HAVE to include the link of the lecture you are commenting on.
We want you to use videos from more recent classes. It takes us a week to get videos up so
focus on the previous three weeks of Lecture when you are formulating your questions.
Twelve of these submissions are due throughout the course of the semester, beginning during
Week Three. However, during week fourteen of the semester, you can make up TWO of these
assignments if you miss two. Again, if you miss more than two, then you are out of luck
because the system will only give you credit for UP TO 4 POINTS during that final week.
HOW TO SUBMIT A NEW QUESTION IN PACKBACK:
STEP ONE: Go to www.soc119.org and select a video segment from class about which you
want to comment
STEP TWO: Log into Packback and go to the SOC 119 page
STEP THREE: Click on “Ask a New Question” and type in the question that you want to
answer pertaining to a segment from the class that you have selected REMEMBER, USE
OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS.
STEP FOUR: Paste the YouTube link into the “Add a Video” box by clicking on the Insert Video
tab (do not just paste it into your text)
STEP FIVE: Write a 300-word answer to your own question. Use paragraphs and do not
make spelling errors.
STEP SIX: Make sure your Curiosity Score is above 80 and then log out
TWELVE - Response Submissions – 24 points
Along with your weekly Question-Answer submission, each week you will also formulate ONE
150-word response to a classmate’s Question-Answer submission assignment that is posted
on the Packback platform. For this response, you MUST get your Curiosity Score to 70.
Each Response Submission is worth TWO (2) points and each response must receive a
“Curiosity Score” of at least 70 for you to receive the points.
Twelve of these submissions are due throughout the course of the semester, beginning during
Week Three. However, as with the Question-Answer submissions, during week fourteen of the
semester, you can make up TWO of these assignments if you miss two. If you miss more than
two, then you are out of luck because the system will only give you credit for UP TO 4 POINTS
during that week.
HOW TO SUBMIT A RESPONSE TO A CLASSMATE’S QUESTION IN PACKBACK :
STEP ONE: Log into Packback and scroll through the Question-Answer submissions from
other students on the SOC 119 Packback page
STEP TWO: Read through questions from your classmates to find one that you would like to
talk about. We pin what we think are some of the more interesting ones at the top.
STEP THREE: Start your Response submission by clicking ""Add Response"" on someone’s
question. Or provide a counter/supporting point to a classmate’s response by selecting ""Add
Response"" on someone’s reply.
STEP FOUR: Check your Curiosity score and make sure that it is at least 70 (remember there
is no half credit) and make sure you hit 150 words.
VERY IMPORTANT:
These assignments are due on Sundays at 11:59pm. If you submit them after 11:59pm, then
they count toward the next week’s required assignments – which means that you do not have
to do them during that next week. But keep track because you can only miss TWO and still
“retrieve” the points during the fourteen week of the semester.
Lecture Participation – 84 Points
Throughout each lecture class on Tuesday and Thursday (4:35 – 5:50pm) we will pass around
an attendance sheet and you’ll sign it. Each class is worth three points. If you arrive more than
10 minutes late, you get either 1.5 points or less, depending on how late you are. If you leave
early, the same thing will happen.
If you try to sign someone else into the class and we catch you doing that, then we’re going to
report you to the Office of Judicial Affairs. We check signatures, by the way, and most people
are terrible at forging signatures.
WATCHING CLASS RECORDINGS OUTSIDE OF CLASS TIME
We will allow you to not be in 100 Thomas (i.e., “miss class”) and either watch the live stream
in real time or watch the recorded class lectures outside of class time (i.e., T/R @ 4:35pm) on
THREE different occasions throughout the semester AND STILL RECEIVE YOUR THREE
LECTURE CLASS PARTICIPATION POINTS. Your attendance grade for these online lectures
will be based on how well you do on the Lecture Attendance Quizzes that are on Canvas.
There is one quiz linked to each of the 28 classes this semester.
Each of these quizzes has THREE questions about the information discussed during the
corresponding lectures. These three questions are each worth 1 point, adding up to a total of 3
points per quiz, the same number of points that you would be able to receive if you were in
class and signed the attendance sheet. Once you start one of those four questions, you have 2
minutes to complete the quiz.
These Canvas quizzes will open after class (generally within the hour) and will remain open for
three weeks from the end of that particular class. After they close, we are not reopening them.
Therefore, you cannot wait until the end of the semester to make up class work.
We are going to say this another way:
YOU CAN ONLY EARN UP TO NINE (9) ATTENDANCE POINTS WATCHING THE LIFE
STREAM OR RECORDINGS OF THREE CLASSES AND TAKING THE CORRESPONDING
LECTURE PARTICIPATION QUIZ ON CANVAS – which means that if you want FULL credit,
then you can only miss in-person class THREE (3) times.
NOTE: If you have an ongoing medical issue that requires that you miss
class on a regular basis or for an extended period, contact the SOC 119 staff
(staff@soc119.org) and let us know what is going on.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud
and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes
cheating, plagiarizing, or facilitating acts of dishonesty of others, having unauthorized
possession of examinations, submitting work of another person.
World in Conversation Dialogue - 36 points
Throughout the semester, you need to have completed THREE World in Conversation
dialogues:
● Some of these are “local” – meaning that you will speak with other students in the class
and maybe a few outside of class.
● Some of these are “global” – meaning that students from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq,
Colombia, Brazil, and Russia will be in the dialogues with you.
Each dialogue is worth 12 points toward your final SOC 119 grade, and because this is an
essential part of the course, we want to emphasize that getting an “A” in this class is almost
impossible if you don’t complete this assignment.
All Global Dialogues occur in Zoom, and by joining them, you will have the chance to have a
conversation with students from different parts of the world. We HIGHLY encourage you to join
AT LEAST one of these dialogues during the semester.
The Local Dialogues will occur both in Zoom rooms and, if Covid-19 allows it, some will
happen in rooms in Pond Lab where you will sit in circles. You can decide which ones you
would like to do, although on some days (e.g., Sundays) all dialogues happen in Zoom.
Keep in mind that:
● Each dialogue is 95 minutes, and you must be in the room the entire time
● You can only register for ONE dialogue at a time per three-week period
● You can choose how many locals and how many globals you want to take during the
semester, as long as you earn the total amount of points for the assignment. However,
again, we really want you to have AT LEAST one Global Dialogue.
● If you miss a dialogue for which you are registered or arrive more than 10 minutes late
and are not allowed in the room, you will have to make it up. We are plannig to have a
makeup week during the fourteenth week of the semester, HOWEVER, you can only
make-up ONE dialogue during that week and also, seats are VERY LIMITED so we
cannot guarantee you an opportunity to do it.
● If you are required to have a World in Conversation dialogue for another course, it
cannot “double count” for this one and this assignment cannot “double count” for your
other course.
More information about this assignment will be posted on the website and sent to you via
email. However, please note the following information about registration:
Here is how this works: EVERY THREE WEEKS you must complete one of your World in
Conversation dialogues (we call that period: Blocks). It is up to you to get them in
during those three weeks. If something happens and you miss one, then re-register for
it during that three-week window or Block. If you cannot fit a dialogue in or there are no
available seats, then you will probably have an opportunity to make ONE of them up
during week fourteen of the semester, but we cannot guarantee you a seat.
Please note:
YOU CAN ONLY MAKE UP ONE OF THREE REQUIRED DIALOGUES AND WE CANNOT
GUARANTEE ENOUGH SEATS DURING WEEK FOURTEEN IF DEMAND IS TOO HIGH.
Let us say that again: During week fourteen of the semester, we cannot have unlimited
dialogues available for people to attend. As such, there will be competition for the seats
available for make-up groups, and you might not get registered. Our best advice is that you do
not slack on this assignment, or you will be in dire straits at the end of the term.
World in Conversation Dialogue Schedule for SOC 119:
Block 1: Sunday, Sept 18 - Friday, Oct 7
Block 2: Sunday, Oct 9 - Friday, Oct 28
Block 3: Sunday, Oct 30 - Friday, Nov 18
Planned Makeup Week: Monday, Nov 28 - Friday, Dec 2
If you have any questions or issues regarding your World in Conversation account, scheduling,
or about the dialogues themselves, please contact the WinC team by filling out the help form at
www.worldinconversation.org/help and someone will get back to you within 24 hours.

About SOC 119 Grades:
Just over 50 percent of you will earn an “A” as your final grade and another 20 percent
will earn an “A-“ as your final grade. That is a really high GPA for any class.
How is that possible given the very rigorous grading scale? This is because this class
is based on “contract grading” – you decide what grade you want in the class and then
do the work that allows you to accumulate the points that you need for that grade. It’s a
contract and nothing is left up in the air. Most people decide to do enough work to earn
an “A” and so grades are high in SOC 119.
You might think that the three quizzes are still “up in the air.” Indeed, you might.
However, the median grade for those quizzes is over 90 percent and it’s really easy to
do well if you actually take the time to do the readings and watch the videos.
For the record, there is no standard PSU grading scale and so please don’t email us
about that. If you do not earn an “A” as your final grade, just remember that over half of
your classmates did – so it’s not that hard, nor is it impossible.",,"RACE, ETHNICITY AND CULTURE (SOC 119N) – Fall 2022
Section 001 & 601 – 4.0 credits
WHERE DOES THE CLASS MEET?
In Person: 100 Thomas Building
TAKING SOC 119 ONLINE OR IN PERSON – WHAT IS POSSIBLE?
Can I take SOC 119 online?
● At this point, we are organizing the class around the idea that everyone will
attend class in person in 100 Thomas Building on Tuesdays and Thursdays at
4:35 – 5:50pm.
What if I cannot attend class?
● Like every other pre-Covid19 semester of SOC 119, students receive points for
being in class because attendance is an “assignment.”
● If you miss class, then you still must make up those points. Even if you have a
valid excuse (medical, academic, personal situation), you will need to make up
those points because attendance is an “assignment.”
How do I make up attendance points when I miss a class?
● You can watch the livestream or a recording of the class and take a Lecture
Attendance Quiz on Canvas afterwards.
● Each class has a Lecture Attendance Quiz associated with it that we activate
within the hour after class ends.
● However, do not attend class and sign the attendance sheet AND then also take
the Lecture Attendance Quiz on Canvas.
How many times during the semester can I NOT come to 100 Thomas for the
in-person class?
● You can watch the livestream or recording instead of attending class on THREE
different occasions throughout the semester.
● Remember, after watching the recording you must take the Lecture Attendance
quiz on Canvas to earn the attendance points.
What happens if I have to take more than THREE of the Lecture Attendance
Quizzes because I’m not in 100 Thomas on more than three occasions?
● After the first three, you can only earn half credit for those attendance points –
even if you take the Lecture Attendance Quizzes and earn all of the points.
What if I get Covid-19 during the semester? Or what if I must go into quarantine?
Or what if I cannot attend class for an extended period because I have
encountered some other issue?
● If you are diagnosed with Covid-19, then as long as we have an email from Penn
State, you will receive another TWO opportunities to not come to class. (You still
have to watch the class and take the Lecture Attendance Quiz, however.)
● So keep in mind that if you decide that you don’t feel like coming to class and so
you stay home, this reduces your flexibility for deciding that you want to miss
class for some random reason later in the semester.
● That said, we will follow Penn State guidelines, just like we do for any extended
illness when instructors are asked to allow students to make up work that they
have missed.
How do I receive attendance credit when I am in 100 Thomas?
● We will take attendance manually by passing around an attendance sheet –
beginning on Tuesday of the second week.
● During the first week, there are no attendance points calculated in Canvas.
Attendance sheets are Old School. I can just sign the name of my friend.
● You can do that. However, we’ve found students to be really bad at forging
names. And besides, we compare signatures, so you’ll probably get caught.
● Cheating is a violation of Penn State policy and it goes on a person’s permanent
record. That sucks.
What should I do if I am sick?
● You can stay home and watch the stream (if you’re feeling well enough) or watch
the recording of the class.
● Each time you do this, however, it counts as one of your THREE opportunities to
not come to 100 Thomas for the class.
What if I am immunocompromised and I want to take SOC 119 as an online
course?
● Reach out to us and then we will consult with Penn State and get back to you.

● HOWEVER, you have to do this during the first week of classes.
What if I am an international student and at the last minute, I have decided not to
risk coming to University Park? Do I need to drop the SOC 119 class?
● Reach out to us and tell us of your plans. We will consult with Penn State and
then get back in touch with you. (staff@soc119.org).
● HOWEVER, you have to do this during the first week of classes.
What if I arrive late at 100 Thomas?
● If you are more than ten minutes (10 min) late, then you need to check in with the
attendance TA who is sitting in the back of the room at the top in the middle
(under the projectors). You will receive partial credit that day for class.
What if I am in class and I need to leave before it ends?
● We will have a TA in the back of the room and this person will have the
attendance sheet. See them as you are exiting the room.
● You will receive partial credit that day for class.
Can I just stay home and watch the SOC 119 live stream instead of coming to the
Thomas Building?
● Yes, but each time that you do this will count as one of your THREE opportunities
to miss the in-person class.
● FYI: SOC 119 is streamed on YouTube every T/R @4:35-5:50pm. We will make
sure that you have the links
Are there any days during the semester when class will be canceled?
● At this point, you will be watching videos of previous SOC 119 classes on
four days (October 18, 20, 25, 27).
● So on these days, you will NOT come to 100 Thomas – BUT YOU WILL WATCH
A VIDEO AND TAKE THE LECTURE ATTENDANCE QUIZ (see below)
● If we do “cancel” an additional class in 100 Thomas, then you will still have to
watch an online class video and take a Lecture Attendance Quiz on Canvas.
● A “canceled” class does not count as one of your THREE opportunities to miss
the in-person class.
What if we have a snow day and class is canceled?
● You will still have to watch an online class video and take the Lecture Attendance
Quiz in Canvas.
● That video will be sent to you and be somewhere on Canvas or by email.
How do I receive attendance credit when I am watching the livestream or the
recordings?
● Each class will have an associated Lecture Attendance Quiz in Canvas that you
will take AFTER you watch the livestream or the recording. The quiz will have
questions pertaining to the class.
● These Lecture Attendance Quizzes on Canvas will be available shortly after each
class period. (Unfortunately, we can only say that we’ll try to have the questions
finished within the hour.)
● Remember, you can only take THREE of these throughout the semester.
● After THREE times that you’re absent from 100 Thomas, then you can only
receive half-credit for your attendance points.
● Again, this policy changes if you are diagnosed with Covid-19.
If I miss a class and I’m not watching the live stream, then how long do I have
before I must watch the recording?
● The Lecture Attendance Quiz on Canvas will be open for exactly three weeks
after the end of each class.
How will my attendance points be calculated?
● We will add up your points derived from the in-person attendance sheets and add
them to your points from the Lecture Attendance Quizzes that you take on
Canvas (i.e., the days that you were not in class)
● For the first THREE Lecture Attendance Quizzes you can earn full credit but any
remaining quizzes can only earn you half credit.
● Remember, don’t come to class AND take the Canvas quiz on the same day.
How do I keep track of my attendance points?
● We do not give you weekly notifications of your attendance grades that are
generated from the attendance sheets.
● So you have to keep track on your own and it is simple: If you miss class and
have to take the Lecture Attendance Quiz, then put THAT particular class (date)
on your to-do list.
How can I contact Sam or Yuli to address anything I need in the course?
● We are available to respond to all class questions or issues ONLY at the email address.
● DO NOT send emails via Canvas because we likely never respond to messages
on those accounts so you will not receive a timely response.
WHAT IS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE COURSE?
To inspire you to think on your own terms regarding whatever it is we end up talking about in
class. We shift the specific topics every semester according to what is in the news and what
people are thinking about. Notice that the objective of the course is not to get you to think in
any particular way, and it is certainly not to “teach” you something. Sam does not believe in
“teaching” – his role is to stimulate you to think on your own terms.
HOW CAN I SEE MY GRADES?

Lecture Attendance Quizzes: You cannot keep track of which quizzes you have done or still
have to do on Canvas. Just keep track on your own. Again, if you miss class and have to
take the Lecture Attendance Quiz, then put THAT particular class (date) on your to-do list.

EARN EXTRA CREDIT
You can earn ONE extra credit point each day that you are selected to be a Case Study
volunteer.
You only receive the point if we select you as a Case Study volunteer and not simply by filling
out the volunteer questionnaire.
You do NOT receive extra credit by randomly raising your hand and asking a question or
making a comment during class.
We will keep track and we will add the points to your Canvas grade at the end of the
semester.
The maximum extra credit you can earn is TWO points.
You must fill out the volunteer survey and sign the Case Study Volunteer consent form to
volunteer and receive the extra credit.
TO VOLUNTEER: Volunteer — SOC 119
ASSIGNMENTS
SYLLABUS QUIZ - 6 points
Read the syllabus and go through Canvas and the website (www.soc119.org). Then take the
quiz. You have three tries to get 100 percent, and hopefully, everyone manages to do that. This
quiz is due on Sunday, September 11 at 11:59 pm.
READINGS and VIDEOS QUIZZES - 66 points
There will be THREE quizzes for the course and you will take them on Canvas outside of
class. You will have THIRTY (30) MINUTES to take each quiz once you start it and there will
be a 72 hour window in which you have to take each quiz.
The quizzes are made up of between 20 - 24 Multiple-Choice questions and will cover ONLY
the readings and videos on the website for each one of the three sections. Each question on
the quizzes is worth ONE point. The third quiz is not cumulative. Readings and videos are at
www.soc119.org.
● QUIZ ONE: 20 Questions
o Opens on Saturday, September 17 at 11:59pm
o Closes on Tuesday, September 20 at 11:59pm
● QUIZ TWO: 22 Questions
o Opens on Saturday, October 22 at 11:59pm
o Closes on Tuesday, October 25 at 11:59pm
● QUIZ THREE: 24 Questions
o Opens on Thursday, December 8 at 11:59pm
o Closes on Monday, December 12 at 11:59pm
NOTE: Some of the Readings and Videos for the THREE quizzes are from The New York
Times digital source. As a Penn State student, you can get a FREE NYT subscription. More
information and details about registering for the NYT can be found in the “Quiz Readings and
Videos” section on our website www.soc119.org/quiz-readings-videos
PACKBACK ASSIGNMENTS – 48 POINTS
PURCHASING PACKBACK: $20.00 (This is a special SOC 119 rate, and it is NOT optional.)
STEPS FOR PURCHASING PACKBACK:
STEP ONE: Go to the SOC 119 Canvas page and find “Packback Questions” in the left
column. Click on that and follow directions, including pay.
IMPORTANT: USE YOUR PENN STATE EMAIL ADDRESS
STEP TWO: Then log into: https://www.packback.co/
STEP THREE: Get started
Or you can take the following steps:
1. Go to: www.packback.co

email
and link SOC 119N using the Lookup Key (above) to your Packback account
4. If you have never used Packback, then below the Log In button you will see “Sign up for
an Account”
5. That will take you to a page in which you use your PSU email (abc1234@psu.edu) and
create a PW
6. On the next page you’ll need the Lookup Key (3e273bf0-ee78-43a5-8c22-4a86f6188e8e) to
link your Packback account to SOC 119N
7. Then you pay your $20
YOU ONLY GET CREDIT FOR ONE (1) SET OF PACKBACK
ASSIGNMENTS EACH WEEK. IF YOU DO MORE THAN ONE,
GOOD FOR YOU – BUT YOU WILL NOT GET SOC 119 CREDIT
UNLESS YULI TELLS YOU THAT WE’LL GIVE YOU CREDIT.
CURIOSITY SCORE:
In order to receive full points for these assignments, your Curiosity Score must be above the
minimum threshold:
● 80 for the Question-Answer submissions
● 70 for the Response submissions
MINIMUM WORD REQUIREMENT:
● 300 for the Question-Answer submissions
● 150 for the Response submissions
Here are a few things to ensure that you reach the CS thresholds of 80/70:
● Do not have spelling errors
● Use paragraphs and make sure you write at least 300 words for new questions/answers
and 150 for a response
● Include the link to the SOC 119 class YouTube video that you are commenting on while
writing your Question/Answer by clicking on the “Insert Video” tab (do not just put it in
the middle of your text)
● There are no half credit responses, so you will either receive FULL points or ZERO
points for your efforts
IF YOUR CURIOSITY SCORE IS LESS THAN 80/70, JUST CLICK ON THE “OPTIONS”
TAB AND EDIT YOUR SUBMISSION.
You cannot edit your submission if someone has commented on it. If that happens, then
just copy what you wrote and resubmit it with the changes that you want to make. So,
for that week you will have two submissions and that is fine.
TWELVE - Question-Answer Submissions – 24 points
You submit twelve (12) of these assignments – one each week. You can forget to submit
assignments for two different weeks and you are still good and will not miss those points
because in week fourteen week of the semester you can make up TWO of your missed
assignments. If you miss more than two, then you are out of luck because the system will only
give you credit for UP TO 4 POINTS for two of these assignments during that week.
You receive TWO (2) points for each Question-Answer submission with a Curiosity Score at 80
or above.
Each week you will select a segment from the lecture that sparks a question in you. On the
Packback platform, you will type in the question and provide the video link from the SOC 119
lecture that points to the part of the class that addresses your question. Then you are going to
answer your own question in a minimum of 300 words. So, each submission will have three
parts to it:
1. Your question
2. A “lecture video” link that you will get from the SOC 119 website (www.soc119.org)
3. Your 300-word response to your own question
If you want, you can include another source in the Source box at the bottom, but definitely, you
HAVE to include the link of the lecture you are commenting on.
We want you to use videos from more recent classes. It takes us a week to get videos up so
focus on the previous three weeks of Lecture when you are formulating your questions.
Twelve of these submissions are due throughout the course of the semester, beginning during
Week Three. However, during week fourteen of the semester, you can make up TWO of these
assignments if you miss two. Again, if you miss more than two, then you are out of luck
because the system will only give you credit for UP TO 4 POINTS during that final week.
HOW TO SUBMIT A NEW QUESTION IN PACKBACK:
STEP ONE: Go to www.soc119.org and select a video segment from class about which you
want to comment
STEP TWO: Log into Packback and go to the SOC 119 page
STEP THREE: Click on “Ask a New Question” and type in the question that you want to
answer pertaining to a segment from the class that you have selected REMEMBER, USE
OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS.
STEP FOUR: Paste the YouTube link into the “Add a Video” box by clicking on the Insert Video
tab (do not just paste it into your text)
STEP FIVE: Write a 300-word answer to your own question. Use paragraphs and do not
make spelling errors.
STEP SIX: Make sure your Curiosity Score is above 80 and then log out
TWELVE - Response Submissions – 24 points
Along with your weekly Question-Answer submission, each week you will also formulate ONE
150-word response to a classmate’s Question-Answer submission assignment that is posted
on the Packback platform. For this response, you MUST get your Curiosity Score to 70.
Each Response Submission is worth TWO (2) points and each response must receive a
“Curiosity Score” of at least 70 for you to receive the points.
Twelve of these submissions are due throughout the course of the semester, beginning during
Week Three. However, as with the Question-Answer submissions, during week fourteen of the
semester, you can make up TWO of these assignments if you miss two. If you miss more than
two, then you are out of luck because the system will only give you credit for UP TO 4 POINTS
during that week.
HOW TO SUBMIT A RESPONSE TO A CLASSMATE’S QUESTION IN PACKBACK :
STEP ONE: Log into Packback and scroll through the Question-Answer submissions from
other students on the SOC 119 Packback page
STEP TWO: Read through questions from your classmates to find one that you would like to
talk about. We pin what we think are some of the more interesting ones at the top.
STEP THREE: Start your Response submission by clicking ""Add Response"" on someone’s
question. Or provide a counter/supporting point to a classmate’s response by selecting ""Add
Response"" on someone’s reply.
STEP FOUR: Check your Curiosity score and make sure that it is at least 70 (remember there
is no half credit) and make sure you hit 150 words.
VERY IMPORTANT:
These assignments are due on Sundays at 11:59pm. If you submit them after 11:59pm, then
they count toward the next week’s required assignments – which means that you do not have
to do them during that next week. But keep track because you can only miss TWO and still
“retrieve” the points during the fourteen week of the semester.
Lecture Participation – 84 Points
Throughout each lecture class on Tuesday and Thursday (4:35 – 5:50pm) we will pass around
an attendance sheet and you’ll sign it. Each class is worth three points. If you arrive more than
10 minutes late, you get either 1.5 points or less, depending on how late you are. If you leave
early, the same thing will happen.
If you try to sign someone else into the class and we catch you doing that, then we’re going to
report you to the Office of Judicial Affairs. We check signatures, by the way, and most people
are terrible at forging signatures.
WATCHING CLASS RECORDINGS OUTSIDE OF CLASS TIME
We will allow you to not be in 100 Thomas (i.e., “miss class”) and either watch the live stream
in real time or watch the recorded class lectures outside of class time (i.e., T/R @ 4:35pm) on
THREE different occasions throughout the semester AND STILL RECEIVE YOUR THREE
LECTURE CLASS PARTICIPATION POINTS. Your attendance grade for these online lectures
will be based on how well you do on the Lecture Attendance Quizzes that are on Canvas.
There is one quiz linked to each of the 28 classes this semester.
Each of these quizzes has THREE questions about the information discussed during the
corresponding lectures. These three questions are each worth 1 point, adding up to a total of 3
points per quiz, the same number of points that you would be able to receive if you were in
class and signed the attendance sheet. Once you start one of those four questions, you have 2
minutes to complete the quiz.
These Canvas quizzes will open after class (generally within the hour) and will remain open for
three weeks from the end of that particular class. After they close, we are not reopening them.
Therefore, you cannot wait until the end of the semester to make up class work.
We are going to say this another way:
YOU CAN ONLY EARN UP TO NINE (9) ATTENDANCE POINTS WATCHING THE LIFE
STREAM OR RECORDINGS OF THREE CLASSES AND TAKING THE CORRESPONDING
LECTURE PARTICIPATION QUIZ ON CANVAS – which means that if you want FULL credit,
then you can only miss in-person class THREE (3) times.
NOTE: If you have an ongoing medical issue that requires that you miss
class on a regular basis or for an extended period, contact the SOC 119 staff
(staff@soc119.org) and let us know what is going on.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud
and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes
cheating, plagiarizing, or facilitating acts of dishonesty of others, having unauthorized
possession of examinations, submitting work of another person.
World in Conversation Dialogue - 36 points
Throughout the semester, you need to have completed THREE World in Conversation
dialogues:
● Some of these are “local” – meaning that you will speak with other students in the class
and maybe a few outside of class.
● Some of these are “global” – meaning that students from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq,
Colombia, Brazil, and Russia will be in the dialogues with you.
Each dialogue is worth 12 points toward your final SOC 119 grade, and because this is an
essential part of the course, we want to emphasize that getting an “A” in this class is almost
impossible if you don’t complete this assignment.
All Global Dialogues occur in Zoom, and by joining them, you will have the chance to have a
conversation with students from different parts of the world. We HIGHLY encourage you to join
AT LEAST one of these dialogues during the semester.
The Local Dialogues will occur both in Zoom rooms and, if Covid-19 allows it, some will
happen in rooms in Pond Lab where you will sit in circles. You can decide which ones you
would like to do, although on some days (e.g., Sundays) all dialogues happen in Zoom.
Keep in mind that:
● Each dialogue is 95 minutes, and you must be in the room the entire time
● You can only register for ONE dialogue at a time per three-week period
● You can choose how many locals and how many globals you want to take during the
semester, as long as you earn the total amount of points for the assignment. However,
again, we really want you to have AT LEAST one Global Dialogue.
● If you miss a dialogue for which you are registered or arrive more than 10 minutes late
and are not allowed in the room, you will have to make it up. We are plannig to have a
makeup week during the fourteenth week of the semester, HOWEVER, you can only
make-up ONE dialogue during that week and also, seats are VERY LIMITED so we
cannot guarantee you an opportunity to do it.
● If you are required to have a World in Conversation dialogue for another course, it
cannot “double count” for this one and this assignment cannot “double count” for your
other course.
More information about this assignment will be posted on the website and sent to you via
email. However, please note the following information about registration:
Here is how this works: EVERY THREE WEEKS you must complete one of your World in
Conversation dialogues (we call that period: Blocks). It is up to you to get them in
during those three weeks. If something happens and you miss one, then re-register for
it during that three-week window or Block. If you cannot fit a dialogue in or there are no
available seats, then you will probably have an opportunity to make ONE of them up
during week fourteen of the semester, but we cannot guarantee you a seat.
Please note:
YOU CAN ONLY MAKE UP ONE OF THREE REQUIRED DIALOGUES AND WE CANNOT
GUARANTEE ENOUGH SEATS DURING WEEK FOURTEEN IF DEMAND IS TOO HIGH.
Let us say that again: During week fourteen of the semester, we cannot have unlimited
dialogues available for people to attend. As such, there will be competition for the seats
available for make-up groups, and you might not get registered. Our best advice is that you do
not slack on this assignment, or you will be in dire straits at the end of the term.
World in Conversation Dialogue Schedule for SOC 119:
Block 1: Sunday, Sept 18 - Friday, Oct 7
Block 2: Sunday, Oct 9 - Friday, Oct 28
Block 3: Sunday, Oct 30 - Friday, Nov 18
Planned Makeup Week: Monday, Nov 28 - Friday, Dec 2
If you have any questions or issues regarding your World in Conversation account, scheduling,
or about the dialogues themselves, please contact the WinC team by filling out the help form at
 someone will get back to you within 24 hours.

About SOC 119 Grades:
Just over 50 percent of you will earn an “A” as your final grade and another 20 percent
will earn an “A-“ as your final grade. That is a really high GPA for any class.
How is that possible given the very rigorous grading scale? This is because this class
is based on “contract grading” – you decide what grade you want in the class and then
do the work that allows you to accumulate the points that you need for that grade. It’s a
contract and nothing is left up in the air. Most people decide to do enough work to earn
an “A” and so grades are high in SOC 119.
You might think that the three quizzes are still “up in the air.” Indeed, you might.
However, the median grade for those quizzes is over 90 percent and it’s really easy to
do well if you actually take the time to do the readings and watch the videos.
For the record, there is no standard PSU grading scale and so please don’t email us
about that. If you do not earn an “A” as your final grade, just remember that over half of
your classmates did – so it’s not that hard, nor is it impossible.","RACE, ETHNICITY AND CULTURE (SOC 119N) – Fall 2022
Section 001 & 601 – 4.0 credits
WHERE DOES THE CLASS MEET?
In Person: 100 Thomas Building
TAKING SOC 119 ONLINE OR IN PERSON – WHAT IS POSSIBLE?
Can I take SOC 119 online?
● At this point, we are organizing the class around the idea that everyone will
attend class in person in 100 Thomas Building on Tuesdays and Thursdays at
4:35 – 5:50pm.
What if I cannot attend class?
● Like every other pre-Covid19 semester of SOC 119, students receive points for
being in class because attendance is an “assignment.”
● If you miss class, then you still must make up those points. Even if you have a
valid excuse (medical, academic, personal situation), you will need to make up
those points because attendance is an “assignment.”
How do I make up attendance points when I miss a class?
● You can watch the livestream or a recording of the class and take a Lecture
Attendance Quiz on Canvas afterwards.
● Each class has a Lecture Attendance Quiz associated with it that we activate
within the hour after class ends.
● However, do not attend class and sign the attendance sheet AND then also take
the Lecture Attendance Quiz on Canvas.
How many times during the semester can I NOT come to 100 Thomas for the
in-person class?
● You can watch the livestream or recording instead of attending class on THREE
different occasions throughout the semester.
● Remember, after watching the recording you must take the Lecture Attendance
quiz on Canvas to earn the attendance points.
What happens if I have to take more than THREE of the Lecture Attendance
Quizzes because I’m not in 100 Thomas on more than three occasions?
● After the first three, you can only earn half credit for those attendance points –
even if you take the Lecture Attendance Quizzes and earn all of the points.
What if I get Covid-19 during the semester? Or what if I must go into quarantine?
Or what if I cannot attend class for an extended period because I have
encountered some other issue?
● If you are diagnosed with Covid-19, then as long as we have an email from Penn
State, you will receive another TWO opportunities to not come to class. (You still
have to watch the class and take the Lecture Attendance Quiz, however.)
● So keep in mind that if you decide that you don’t feel like coming to class and so
you stay home, this reduces your flexibility for deciding that you want to miss
class for some random reason later in the semester.
● That said, we will follow Penn State guidelines, just like we do for any extended
illness when instructors are asked to allow students to make up work that they
have missed.
How do I receive attendance credit when I am in 100 Thomas?
● We will take attendance manually by passing around an attendance sheet –
beginning on Tuesday of the second week.
● During the first week, there are no attendance points calculated in Canvas.
Attendance sheets are Old School. I can just sign the name of my friend.
● You can do that. However, we’ve found students to be really bad at forging
names. And besides, we compare signatures, so you’ll probably get caught.
● Cheating is a violation of Penn State policy and it goes on a person’s permanent
record. That sucks.
What should I do if I am sick?
● You can stay home and watch the stream (if you’re feeling well enough) or watch
the recording of the class.
● Each time you do this, however, it counts as one of your THREE opportunities to
not come to 100 Thomas for the class.
What if I am immunocompromised and I want to take SOC 119 as an online
course?
● Reach out to us and then we will consult with Penn State and get back to you.

● HOWEVER, you have to do this during the first week of classes.
What if I am an international student and at the last minute, I have decided not to
risk coming to University Park? Do I need to drop the SOC 119 class?
● Reach out to us and tell us of your plans. We will consult with Penn State and
then get back in touch with you. (staff@soc119.org).
● HOWEVER, you have to do this during the first week of classes.
What if I arrive late at 100 Thomas?
● If you are more than ten minutes (10 min) late, then you need to check in with the
attendance TA who is sitting in the back of the room at the top in the middle
(under the projectors). You will receive partial credit that day for class.
What if I am in class and I need to leave before it ends?
● We will have a TA in the back of the room and this person will have the
attendance sheet. See them as you are exiting the room.
● You will receive partial credit that day for class.
Can I just stay home and watch the SOC 119 live stream instead of coming to the
Thomas Building?
● Yes, but each time that you do this will count as one of your THREE opportunities
to miss the in-person class.
● FYI: SOC 119 is streamed on YouTube every T/R @4:35-5:50pm. We will make
sure that you have the links
Are there any days during the semester when class will be canceled?
● At this point, you will be watching videos of previous SOC 119 classes on
four days (October 18, 20, 25, 27).
● So on these days, you will NOT come to 100 Thomas – BUT YOU WILL WATCH
A VIDEO AND TAKE THE LECTURE ATTENDANCE QUIZ (see below)
● If we do “cancel” an additional class in 100 Thomas, then you will still have to
watch an online class video and take a Lecture Attendance Quiz on Canvas.
● A “canceled” class does not count as one of your THREE opportunities to miss
the in-person class.
What if we have a snow day and class is canceled?
● You will still have to watch an online class video and take the Lecture Attendance
Quiz in Canvas.
● That video will be sent to you and be somewhere on Canvas or by email.
How do I receive attendance credit when I am watching the livestream or the
recordings?
● Each class will have an associated Lecture Attendance Quiz in Canvas that you
will take AFTER you watch the livestream or the recording. The quiz will have
questions pertaining to the class.
● These Lecture Attendance Quizzes on Canvas will be available shortly after each
class period. (Unfortunately, we can only say that we’ll try to have the questions
finished within the hour.)
● Remember, you can only take THREE of these throughout the semester.
● After THREE times that you’re absent from 100 Thomas, then you can only
receive half-credit for your attendance points.
● Again, this policy changes if you are diagnosed with Covid-19.
If I miss a class and I’m not watching the live stream, then how long do I have
before I must watch the recording?
● The Lecture Attendance Quiz on Canvas will be open for exactly three weeks
after the end of each class.
How will my attendance points be calculated?
● We will add up your points derived from the in-person attendance sheets and add
them to your points from the Lecture Attendance Quizzes that you take on
Canvas (i.e., the days that you were not in class)
● For the first THREE Lecture Attendance Quizzes you can earn full credit but any
remaining quizzes can only earn you half credit.
● Remember, don’t come to class AND take the Canvas quiz on the same day.
How do I keep track of my attendance points?
● We do not give you weekly notifications of your attendance grades that are
generated from the attendance sheets.
● So you have to keep track on your own and it is simple: If you miss class and
have to take the Lecture Attendance Quiz, then put THAT particular class (date)
on your to-do list.
How can I contact Sam or Yuli to address anything I need in the course?
● We are available to respond to all class questions or issues ONLY at the email address.
● DO NOT send emails via Canvas because we likely never respond to messages
on those accounts so you will not receive a timely response.
WHAT IS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE COURSE?
To inspire you to think on your own terms regarding whatever it is we end up talking about in
class. We shift the specific topics every semester according to what is in the news and what
people are thinking about. Notice that the objective of the course is not to get you to think in
any particular way, and it is certainly not to “teach” you something. Sam does not believe in
“teaching” – his role is to stimulate you to think on your own terms.
HOW CAN I SEE MY GRADES?
Packback: Follow your progress on your personal Packback page:

World in Conversation: Follow your progress on the WinC landing page when you’re logged in
Lecture Attendance Quizzes: You cannot keep track of which quizzes you have done or still
have to do on Canvas. Just keep track on your own. Again, if you miss class and have to
take the Lecture Attendance Quiz, then put THAT particular class (date) on your to-do list.

EARN EXTRA CREDIT
You can earn ONE extra credit point each day that you are selected to be a Case Study
volunteer.
You only receive the point if we select you as a Case Study volunteer and not simply by filling
out the volunteer questionnaire.
You do NOT receive extra credit by randomly raising your hand and asking a question or
making a comment during class.
We will keep track and we will add the points to your Canvas grade at the end of the
semester.
The maximum extra credit you can earn is TWO points.
You must fill out the volunteer survey and sign the Case Study Volunteer consent form to
volunteer and receive the extra credit.
TO VOLUNTEER: Volunteer — SOC 119
ASSIGNMENTS
SYLLABUS QUIZ - 6 points
Read the syllabus and go through Canvas and the website (www.soc119.org). Then take the
quiz. You have three tries to get 100 percent, and hopefully, everyone manages to do that. This
quiz is due on Sunday, September 11 at 11:59 pm.
READINGS and VIDEOS QUIZZES - 66 points
There will be THREE quizzes for the course and you will take them on Canvas outside of
class. You will have THIRTY (30) MINUTES to take each quiz once you start it and there will
be a 72 hour window in which you have to take each quiz.
The quizzes are made up of between 20 - 24 Multiple-Choice questions and will cover ONLY
the readings and videos on the website for each one of the three sections. Each question on
the quizzes is worth ONE point. The third quiz is not cumulative. Readings and videos are at
www.soc119.org.
● QUIZ ONE: 20 Questions
o Opens on Saturday, September 17 at 11:59pm
o Closes on Tuesday, September 20 at 11:59pm
● QUIZ TWO: 22 Questions
o Opens on Saturday, October 22 at 11:59pm
o Closes on Tuesday, October 25 at 11:59pm
● QUIZ THREE: 24 Questions
o Opens on Thursday, December 8 at 11:59pm
o Closes on Monday, December 12 at 11:59pm
NOTE: Some of the Readings and Videos for the THREE quizzes are from The New York
Times digital source. As a Penn State student, you can get a FREE NYT subscription. More
information and details about registering for the NYT can be found in the “Quiz Readings and
Videos” section on our website www.soc119.org/quiz-readings-videos
PACKBACK ASSIGNMENTS – 48 POINTS
PURCHASING PACKBACK: $20.00 (This is a special SOC 119 rate, and it is NOT optional.)
STEPS FOR PURCHASING PACKBACK:
STEP ONE: Go to the SOC 119 Canvas page and find “Packback Questions” in the left
column. Click on that and follow directions, including pay.
IMPORTANT: USE YOUR PENN STATE EMAIL ADDRESS

5. That will take you to a page in which you use your PSU email (abc1234@psu.edu) and
create a PW
6. On the next page you’ll need the Lookup Key (3e273bf0-ee78-43a5-8c22-4a86f6188e8e) to
link your Packback account to SOC 119N
7. Then you pay your $20
YOU ONLY GET CREDIT FOR ONE (1) SET OF PACKBACK
ASSIGNMENTS EACH WEEK. IF YOU DO MORE THAN ONE,
GOOD FOR YOU – BUT YOU WILL NOT GET SOC 119 CREDIT
UNLESS YULI TELLS YOU THAT WE’LL GIVE YOU CREDIT.
CURIOSITY SCORE:
In order to receive full points for these assignments, your Curiosity Score must be above the
minimum threshold:
● 80 for the Question-Answer submissions
● 70 for the Response submissions
MINIMUM WORD REQUIREMENT:
● 300 for the Question-Answer submissions
● 150 for the Response submissions
Here are a few things to ensure that you reach the CS thresholds of 80/70:
● Do not have spelling errors
● Use paragraphs and make sure you write at least 300 words for new questions/answers
and 150 for a response
● Include the link to the SOC 119 class YouTube video that you are commenting on while
writing your Question/Answer by clicking on the “Insert Video” tab (do not just put it in
the middle of your text)
● There are no half credit responses, so you will either receive FULL points or ZERO
points for your efforts
IF YOUR CURIOSITY SCORE IS LESS THAN 80/70, JUST CLICK ON THE “OPTIONS”
TAB AND EDIT YOUR SUBMISSION.
You cannot edit your submission if someone has commented on it. If that happens, then
just copy what you wrote and resubmit it with the changes that you want to make. So,
for that week you will have two submissions and that is fine.
TWELVE - Question-Answer Submissions – 24 points
You submit twelve (12) of these assignments – one each week. You can forget to submit
assignments for two different weeks and you are still good and will not miss those points
because in week fourteen week of the semester you can make up TWO of your missed
assignments. If you miss more than two, then you are out of luck because the system will only
give you credit for UP TO 4 POINTS for two of these assignments during that week.
You receive TWO (2) points for each Question-Answer submission with a Curiosity Score at 80
or above.
Each week you will select a segment from the lecture that sparks a question in you. On the
Packback platform, you will type in the question and provide the video link from the SOC 119
lecture that points to the part of the class that addresses your question. Then you are going to
answer your own question in a minimum of 300 words. So, each submission will have three
parts to it:
1. Your question
2. A “lecture video” link that you will get from the SOC 119 website (www.soc119.org)
3. Your 300-word response to your own question
If you want, you can include another source in the Source box at the bottom, but definitely, you
HAVE to include the link of the lecture you are commenting on.
We want you to use videos from more recent classes. It takes us a week to get videos up so
focus on the previous three weeks of Lecture when you are formulating your questions.
Twelve of these submissions are due throughout the course of the semester, beginning during
Week Three. However, during week fourteen of the semester, you can make up TWO of these
assignments if you miss two. Again, if you miss more than two, then you are out of luck
because the system will only give you credit for UP TO 4 POINTS during that final week.
HOW TO SUBMIT A NEW QUESTION IN PACKBACK:
STEP ONE: Go to www.soc119.org and select a video segment from class about which you
want to comment
STEP TWO: Log into Packback and go to the SOC 119 page
STEP THREE: Click on “Ask a New Question” and type in the question that you want to
answer pertaining to a segment from the class that you have selected REMEMBER, USE
OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS.
STEP FOUR: Paste the YouTube link into the “Add a Video” box by clicking on the Insert Video
tab (do not just paste it into your text)
STEP FIVE: Write a 300-word answer to your own question. Use paragraphs and do not
make spelling errors.
STEP SIX: Make sure your Curiosity Score is above 80 and then log out
TWELVE - Response Submissions – 24 points
Along with your weekly Question-Answer submission, each week you will also formulate ONE
150-word response to a classmate’s Question-Answer submission assignment that is posted
on the Packback platform. For this response, you MUST get your Curiosity Score to 70.
Each Response Submission is worth TWO (2) points and each response must receive a
“Curiosity Score” of at least 70 for you to receive the points.
Twelve of these submissions are due throughout the course of the semester, beginning during
Week Three. However, as with the Question-Answer submissions, during week fourteen of the
semester, you can make up TWO of these assignments if you miss two. If you miss more than
two, then you are out of luck because the system will only give you credit for UP TO 4 POINTS
during that week.
HOW TO SUBMIT A RESPONSE TO A CLASSMATE’S QUESTION IN PACKBACK :
STEP ONE: Log into Packback and scroll through the Question-Answer submissions from
other students on the SOC 119 Packback page
STEP TWO: Read through questions from your classmates to find one that you would like to
talk about. We pin what we think are some of the more interesting ones at the top.
STEP THREE: Start your Response submission by clicking ""Add Response"" on someone’s
question. Or provide a counter/supporting point to a classmate’s response by selecting ""Add
Response"" on someone’s reply.
STEP FOUR: Check your Curiosity score and make sure that it is at least 70 (remember there
is no half credit) and make sure you hit 150 words.
VERY IMPORTANT:
These assignments are due on Sundays at 11:59pm. If you submit them after 11:59pm, then
they count toward the next week’s required assignments – which means that you do not have
to do them during that next week. But keep track because you can only miss TWO and still
“retrieve” the points during the fourteen week of the semester.
Lecture Participation – 84 Points
Throughout each lecture class on Tuesday and Thursday (4:35 – 5:50pm) we will pass around
an attendance sheet and you’ll sign it. Each class is worth three points. If you arrive more than
10 minutes late, you get either 1.5 points or less, depending on how late you are. If you leave
early, the same thing will happen.
If you try to sign someone else into the class and we catch you doing that, then we’re going to
report you to the Office of Judicial Affairs. We check signatures, by the way, and most people
are terrible at forging signatures.
WATCHING CLASS RECORDINGS OUTSIDE OF CLASS TIME
We will allow you to not be in 100 Thomas (i.e., “miss class”) and either watch the live stream
in real time or watch the recorded class lectures outside of class time (i.e., T/R @ 4:35pm) on
THREE different occasions throughout the semester AND STILL RECEIVE YOUR THREE
LECTURE CLASS PARTICIPATION POINTS. Your attendance grade for these online lectures
will be based on how well you do on the Lecture Attendance Quizzes that are on Canvas.
There is one quiz linked to each of the 28 classes this semester.
Each of these quizzes has THREE questions about the information discussed during the
corresponding lectures. These three questions are each worth 1 point, adding up to a total of 3
points per quiz, the same number of points that you would be able to receive if you were in
class and signed the attendance sheet. Once you start one of those four questions, you have 2
minutes to complete the quiz.
These Canvas quizzes will open after class (generally within the hour) and will remain open for
three weeks from the end of that particular class. After they close, we are not reopening them.
Therefore, you cannot wait until the end of the semester to make up class work.
We are going to say this another way:
YOU CAN ONLY EARN UP TO NINE (9) ATTENDANCE POINTS WATCHING THE LIFE
STREAM OR RECORDINGS OF THREE CLASSES AND TAKING THE CORRESPONDING
LECTURE PARTICIPATION QUIZ ON CANVAS – which means that if you want FULL credit,
then you can only miss in-person class THREE (3) times.
NOTE: If you have an ongoing medical issue that requires that you miss
class on a regular basis or for an extended period, contact the SOC 119 staff
(staff@soc119.org) and let us know what is going on.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud
and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes
cheating, plagiarizing, or facilitating acts of dishonesty of others, having unauthorized
possession of examinations, submitting work of another person.
World in Conversation Dialogue - 36 points
Throughout the semester, you need to have completed THREE World in Conversation
dialogues:
● Some of these are “local” – meaning that you will speak with other students in the class
and maybe a few outside of class.
● Some of these are “global” – meaning that students from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq,
Colombia, Brazil, and Russia will be in the dialogues with you.
Each dialogue is worth 12 points toward your final SOC 119 grade, and because this is an
essential part of the course, we want to emphasize that getting an “A” in this class is almost
impossible if you don’t complete this assignment.
All Global Dialogues occur in Zoom, and by joining them, you will have the chance to have a
conversation with students from different parts of the world. We HIGHLY encourage you to join
AT LEAST one of these dialogues during the semester.
The Local Dialogues will occur both in Zoom rooms and, if Covid-19 allows it, some will
happen in rooms in Pond Lab where you will sit in circles. You can decide which ones you
would like to do, although on some days (e.g., Sundays) all dialogues happen in Zoom.
Keep in mind that:
● Each dialogue is 95 minutes, and you must be in the room the entire time
● You can only register for ONE dialogue at a time per three-week period
● You can choose how many locals and how many globals you want to take during the
semester, as long as you earn the total amount of points for the assignment. However,
again, we really want you to have AT LEAST one Global Dialogue.
● If you miss a dialogue for which you are registered or arrive more than 10 minutes late
and are not allowed in the room, you will have to make it up. We are plannig to have a
makeup week during the fourteenth week of the semester, HOWEVER, you can only
make-up ONE dialogue during that week and also, seats are VERY LIMITED so we
cannot guarantee you an opportunity to do it.
● If you are required to have a World in Conversation dialogue for another course, it
cannot “double count” for this one and this assignment cannot “double count” for your
other course.
More information about this assignment will be posted on the website and sent to you via
email. However, please note the following information about registration:
Here is how this works: EVERY THREE WEEKS you must complete one of your World in
Conversation dialogues (we call that period: Blocks). It is up to you to get them in
during those three weeks. If something happens and you miss one, then re-register for
it during that three-week window or Block. If you cannot fit a dialogue in or there are no
available seats, then you will probably have an opportunity to make ONE of them up
during week fourteen of the semester, but we cannot guarantee you a seat.
Please note:
YOU CAN ONLY MAKE UP ONE OF THREE REQUIRED DIALOGUES AND WE CANNOT
GUARANTEE ENOUGH SEATS DURING WEEK FOURTEEN IF DEMAND IS TOO HIGH.
Let us say that again: During week fourteen of the semester, we cannot have unlimited
dialogues available for people to attend. As such, there will be competition for the seats
available for make-up groups, and you might not get registered. Our best advice is that you do
not slack on this assignment, or you will be in dire straits at the end of the term.
World in Conversation Dialogue Schedule for SOC 119:
Block 1: Sunday, Sept 18 - Friday, Oct 7
Block 2: Sunday, Oct 9 - Friday, Oct 28
Block 3: Sunday, Oct 30 - Friday, Nov 18
Planned Makeup Week: Monday, Nov 28 - Friday, Dec 2
If you have any questions or issues regarding your World in Conversation account, scheduling,
or about the dialogues themselves, please contact the WinC team by filling out the help form at
 someone will get back to you within 24 hours.

About SOC 119 Grades:
Just over 50 percent of you will earn an “A” as your final grade and another 20 percent
will earn an “A-“ as your final grade. That is a really high GPA for any class.
How is that possible given the very rigorous grading scale? This is because this class
is based on “contract grading” – you decide what grade you want in the class and then
do the work that allows you to accumulate the points that you need for that grade. It’s a
contract and nothing is left up in the air. Most people decide to do enough work to earn
an “A” and so grades are high in SOC 119.
You might think that the three quizzes are still “up in the air.” Indeed, you might.
However, the median grade for those quizzes is over 90 percent and it’s really easy to
do well if you actually take the time to do the readings and watch the videos.
For the record, there is no standard PSU grading scale and so please don’t email us
about that. If you do not earn an “A” as your final grade, just remember that over half of
your classmates did – so it’s not that hard, nor is it impossible.","['race', 'ethnicity', 'culture', 'soc', 'n', 'fall', 'section', 'credit', 'class', 'meet', 'person', 'thomas', 'building',

Course Description
The goal of this course is to help you develop the reading and writing skills you need to
participate successfully in academic reading and writing tasks at an American university.
In this course you will practice academic writing, which includes summarizing,
paraphrasing, quoting, organizing your ideas, doing basic library research, supporting
your claims with good forms of evidence, and preparing citations. You will participate in
all stages of the writing process, which means that you will brainstorm, draft, revise, give
and get feedback through peer review, and proofread. You will also learn and practice
useful reading skills and strategies to support your research and writing activities. [use
‘you’ in this section and the next; your students are mostly new the US and to college
life, and a difficult-to-read syllabus doesn’t help them]
Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Use the writing process effectively. This means that you will be able to generate
ideas, plan and draft essays, revise your writing, and identify and correct major
grammatical problems. You will also be able to give and take guided feedback
through peer-review.
2. Write different kinds of essays that meet the needs of different audiences and
purposes. Your essays will demonstrate that you understand the concept of
audience, genre, and voice.
3. Use critical reading skills to get information from academic texts. You will be
able to identify main points and details, determine audience and purpose,
summarize, and respond to written English texts.
4. Use academic vocabulary related to course readings accurately and appropriately.
5. Use outside source material effectively and ethically through summarizing,
paraphrasing, quoting, and citing sources appropriately.
6. Write clear and comprehensible sentences and paragraphs that form coherent and
cohesive texts.
7. Identify and correct common grammatical and mechanical errors, and know how
to seek further help from sources outside of class.

Course Policies
Preparation of HW and written assignments
All major assignments must be prepared digitally and will be handed in via
psu.turnitin.edu or angel.psu.edu. All assignments need to follow the following
guidelines: 12 point Times New Roman font, 1-inch margins around, and double spaced.
NO EXCEPTIONS! Points will be deducted for improper formatting.
Classroom Distractions
There may be class time allotted to in-class lab days. You will either be expected to meet
in a computer lab on campus or bring laptops to class to work. Otherwise, cell phones,
laptops, tablets, and any other electronic devices need to be turned off before class starts.
Late Assignments & Extra Credit
Turn in your assignments on time. Absolutely no late assignments will be accepted! If it
is not turned in online before the dropbox closes, you will receive a zero for that
assignment/project. Please note that the Extra Credit projects must be turned in by the
stated deadline to earn points!
HOW YOU WILL BE EVALUATED
Attendance & in-class participation (5% of your total grade)
Come to class on time; participate in the activities; do the assigned readings and HW
before class; bring your textbook and HW papers to class; contact the instructor if you
know that you will have a problem attending on a certain day. You will be assigned
various tasks, such as an office hour consultation with the instructor; a library orientation
workshop; a visit to a campus activity, etc. These tasks are required! You will be allowed
3 absences for the semester. You will lose 2% off your final grade for every additional
absence you have.
Peer reviews & other HW (5% of your total grade)
A good writer knows how to read and revise a text. In this class, you will have a chance
to work closely with your classmates in giving, and receiving, peer feedback to make
your revising better. This is a required part of the class and I will help you develop your
peer reviewing skills.
Sometimes you will be assigned HW outside of the writing assignments or reading
textbook. These assignments must be completed before class, and you are responsible for
bringing them to class with you. No late assignments will be accepted!
Journal entries/Reading Responses (10% of your total grade each)
In addition to the 4 major writing assignments, you will be required to write several
informal, journal texts. The journal entry assignments are designed to help you develop
ideas for your writing; understand the readings better; organize information for better
communication; and practice using sentence structures and lexical items that are useful
for your writing. Some journals will be personal topics, some will be based on the
readings. There will be an equal amount of each.

PSU Policies
Enrollment & Withdrawal
You are responsible for making all decisions regarding your enrollment status in and any
Financial Holds for Penn State courses. Should you decide to withdraw from this course, you
must either (1) drop via eLion or (2) complete an official “add/drop” form and submit it to your
advisor by University deadlines. If you are failing the course and do not officially withdraw, you
will receive a final grade of F. Please talk to me if you have any questions about this process.
Academic Integrity & Plagiarism
Plagiarism is using someone else’s words, ideas, and/or data in your work and treating it as your
own by either not citing it or by citing it inappropriately. Plagiarism is a very serious issue in the
American university system. Within Penn State, the College of Liberal Arts has the following
policy regarding academic honesty and plagiarism:
“Penn State defines academic integrity as the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and
responsible manner. All students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’
dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can
succeed through the fruits of their efforts (Faculty Senate Policy 49-20).
Dishonesty of any kind will not be tolerated in this course. Dishonesty includes, but is not limited
to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating information or citations, facilitating acts of academic
dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of
another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the
academic work of other students. Students who are found to be dishonest will receive academic 
sanctions and will be reported to the University’s Judicial Affairs office for possible further
disciplinary sanction.” (http://www.la.psu.edu/CLA-Deans_Area/Preparingyoursyllabus.shtml)
Questions about academic integrity can be referred to Ashley Tarbet at aet143@psu.edu or (814)
865-1070.
Disability Access Statement
“The Pennsylvania State University encourages qualified people with disabilities to participate in
its programs and activities and is committed to the policy that all people shall have equal access
to programs, facilities, and admissions without regard to personal characteristics not related to
ability, performance, or qualifications as determined by University policy or by state or federal

about physical access, please tell the instructor as soon as possible.”
(http://www.la.psu.edu/CLA-Deans_Area/Preparingyoursyllabus.shtml)

Academic Integrity & Plagiarism
Plagiarism is using someone else’s words, ideas, and/or data in your work and treating it as your
own by either not citing it or by citing it inappropriately. Plagiarism is a very serious issue in the
American university system. Within Penn State, the College of Liberal Arts has the following
policy regarding academic honesty and plagiarism:
“Penn State defines academic integrity as the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and
responsible manner. All students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’
dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can
succeed through the fruits of their efforts (Faculty Senate Policy 49-20).
Dishonesty of any kind will not be tolerated in this course. Dishonesty includes, but is not limited
to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating information or citations, facilitating acts of academic
dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of
another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the
academic work of other students. Students who are found to be dishonest will receive academic 
sanctions and will be reported to the University’s Judicial Affairs office for possible further
disciplinary sanction.” (http://www.la.psu.edu/CLA-Deans_Area/Preparingyoursyllabus.shtml)

Course Description
The goal of this course is to help you develop the reading and writing skills you need to
participate successfully in academic reading and writing tasks at an American university.
In this course you will practice academic writing, which includes summarizing,
paraphrasing, quoting, organizing your ideas, doing basic library research, supporting
your claims with good forms of evidence, and preparing citations. You will participate in
all stages of the writing process, which means that you will brainstorm, draft, revise, give
and get feedback through peer review, and proofread. You will also learn and practice
useful reading skills and strategies to support your research and writing activities. [use
‘you’ in this section and the next; your students are mostly new the US and to college
life, and a difficult-to-read syllabus doesn’t help them]
Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Use the writing process effectively. This means that you will be able to generate
ideas, plan and draft essays, revise your writing, and identify and correct major
grammatical problems. You will also be able to give and take guided feedback
through peer-review.
2. Write different kinds of essays that meet the needs of different audiences and
purposes. Your essays will demonstrate that you understand the concept of
audience, genre, and voice.
3. Use critical reading skills to get information from academic texts. You will be
able to identify main points and details, determine audience and purpose,
summarize, and respond to written English texts.
4. Use academic vocabulary related to course readings accurately and appropriately.
5. Use outside source material effectively and ethically through summarizing,
paraphrasing, quoting, and citing sources appropriately.
6. Write clear and comprehensible sentences and paragraphs that form coherent and
cohesive texts.
7. Identify and correct common grammatical and mechanical errors, and know how
to seek further help from sources outside of class.

Office hours: Thur: 2:00~3:00 / Fri: 10:00~11:00
Purpose	This course is a continuation of MATH/STAT 318 and covers statistical inference, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, regression and correlation analysis, and analysis of variance. Some computer analysis may appear from time to time as well.
Required Textbook	Devore and Berk Modern Mathematical Statistics with Applications ( 2007)
Chapters Covered	Chapter 6 - 12 (13, 14 if time permits)
Course Website:	http://www.personal.psu.edu/yoh5109/319spring2013/index.html Please check it regularly and frequently.
You still need to use Angel to download the solutions and check your grades.
Grading	There will be two midterms (15% each), a comprehensive final exam (30%), homework (25%), quizzes (15%). Final semester grades are assigned according to the scale:
93 - 100%    A	      	90 - 92%    A-	      	87 - 89%    B+	      
83 - 86%    B	      	80 - 82%    B-	      	77 - 79%    C+	      
70 - 76%    C	      	60 - 69%    D	      	0 - 59%    F	      
Grade Calculator: 1. Use for grades before April 1st.      2. The amazingly comprehensive version.
Homework Homework is due by the beginning of class on its due date. Unless you inform TA at least 24 hours before homework is due about any extenuating circumstances, late homework will not be accepted. Late work is penalized 10% and accepted only if solutions have not been posted. I will drop one lowest homework.
Solutions for each assignment will be posted on Angel, typically by the time the homework is returned to you. Homework will usually be returned within one week from the due date.
Quizzes Randomly timed, in-class quizzes will be given. Such a quiz might be announced or unannounced. No make-up quizzes will be given for any reason. However, I will drop three lowest quizzes.
Exams There will be two midterm exams on dates to be announced. The second midterm will not be comprehensive; i.e., it will cover only the period of time between the two midterms. If you must miss any midterm, you should provide a valid reason IN WRITING to the instructor 48 hours PRIOR TO the midterm. If you have to miss a midterm at the last minute for some reason, be sure to notify the instructor prior to the midterm time by email; in these cases, you should later back up your excuse with written documentation. An unexcused absence on an midterm date will result in a score of 0.
The comprehensive final exam will take place at the registrar-designated time and place during the week of April 29 - May 3. Unlike the midterms, it will cover the entire semester and not merely the period after the second midterm. No rescheduled final exams will be allowed except for those mandated by the Penn State registrar because of conflicts. This means that you must attend the final exam and should under no circumstances make end-of-semester travel arrangements before knowing your final exam schedule.
OTHER GRADING NOTES:
Solution sets for the homeworks will be provided; login to the course ANGEL page to access them. You are strongly encouraged to learn how to do any homework problems you had trouble with, either by reading the solutions, discussing them with colleagues in the course, or asking questions of the grader or me. This is especially important in this course, where solving problems is absolutely essential to learn the material. I am happy to devote some class time to answering homework questions as necessary.
Don't overlook office hours (mine or the grader's) as a great opportunity to discuss homework, both past and present. You do not need an appointment to show up to office hours; simply walk in!
Academic Integrity	The University policy on academic integrity, covering cheating, plagiarizing, and other acts of academic dishonesty, given in Section 49-20 of the Student Guide on Policies and Rules of the University, will be adhered to in this course. See http://science.psu.edu/current-students/Integrity/ Policy.html concerning academic integrity for details.	
Other Course Rules	
Students are responsible for all announcements and supplements given within any lecture.
If you need to leave class early, please sit in the rear and leave as quietly as possible.
Please be courteous to your classmates and keep extra noise to a minimum.

Your total grade can be negatively affected by not submitting Individual POAs or any other case
assignments according to schedule (see policies below). All team assignments are subject to
satisfactory performance ratings by your team members as completed in a peer evaluation survey.
Deadlines
Students are responsible for all information disseminated in class, by Email, or on Canvas, and for all
course requirements, including meeting deadlines and examinations. Late submissions are acceptable
only upon the instructor’s prior permission. A 10% penalty is implemented, possibly each week, if an
assignment is late. If the student is unable to meet the deadline due to absence from class approved by
the instructor, the student is expected to turn in the assignment PRIOR to his or her leave.
WRITING GUIDELINES:
All writings should be typed and follow this format: 1.5 line spacing, 12-point Times New Roman
font, one-inch margins, and discipline-appropriate citations. MS Office uses a default of 1.5""

Double-spaced papers or other incorrectly formatted papers would be subject to heavy penalties. A
rubric will be provided for guidelines and expectations.
General Format for APA and General Format for MLA from the Purdue OWL - You may choose
either one to use.
When making a factual statement, or needing facts to back up your point of view, argument or idea,
please include references! It is what will make your work credible.
Also, Wikipedia is not an officially recognized academic reference. On your own, you may use a
Wikipedia page to read about a topic or gain some ideas and information, but you must go to the
official sources listed below the Wikipedia and click on those to read and officially use in your work.
Points will be deducted for using Wikipedia as a reference.
ASSIGNMENTS/SIMULATION
Quizzes
See schedule for quizzes to be used in class to assess your understanding of the articles. Quizzes will
be administered on the course website. I will let you know the details on Canvas.
Individual Plans of Action (POAs) (Best 2 of 3 available):
A Plan of Action (POA) provides your analysis of a case and your action plan to solve the business
problem described in a case. Specific guidelines for writing a POA will be provided in CANVAS as
well as discussed in class.
Your lowest grade of the first two individual POAs will be dropped. You must complete all case
POAs, the last cannot be dropped. The group POA cannot be dropped. Any 0 score for a failed
submission is not eligible to be considered as one of your lowest grades to drop. You cannot “skip” a
POA assignment. See schedule for when POAs are due in Canvas.
A note on Plagiarism
Your instructor or the teaching assistant will upload all POAs written into Turnitin, the plagiarism
detection system, using the electronic copy you provide. Turnitin will produce an Originality Report
for each of your papers submitted. Turnitin will detect any plagiarism from outside sources found on
the Internet, in papers turned in during prior semesters, or in papers turned in at other schools.
For this reason, no grades given for your POAs will be completely official until you have submitted an
electronic copy of your paper into the course website and Turnitin has detected no problems with
originality. Please refer to the discussion on plagiarism at the back of this course outline for more
insight into why plagiarism is such a concern.
MarkStrat Simulation
During the course, you will get the opportunity to decide on strategic marketing issues such as
branding, positioning, marketing research, and new product development, in a simulation game. In

order to let you integrate the ideas presented in your previous marketing courses, we will use an online
marketing simulation game called MarkStrat. MarkStrat focuses on the strategic marketing strategy of
a firm active in consumer durables.
The simulation is a large part of the course workload. The MarkStrat assignments are done in teams.
Each team will assume the role of the top management of a firm in a computer simulated industrial
environment, and will make strategy decisions for eight periods in time representing eight years of the
firm’s existence. I will begin the actual simulation with a limited set of decisions you can make, and
then extend your strategic scope as you progress in the simulation. Because this is an online course, I
will assign you the teams.
Depending on the size of the class, there will be one or two identical industries in this class, each with
four companies competing within the industry. The teams within each industry will have different but
comparable starting points, and you will compete directly with each other.
Your overall goal will be to improve your Share Price Index over the course of the eight periods (or
years). This improvement will be measured in two different ways:
 The weekly performance in terms of Share Price Index improvement versus the previous
period (for periods 1-5);
 The final performance (after Period 6) in terms of Share Price Index improvement versus the
starting value in Period 0.
In addition to the performance in the simulation, I value your learning process. You will deliver a final
presentation powerpoint voiceover that will review the strategy you followed, what worked well, what
did not work well, what you learned, and your advice to a new management team taking over the firm.
Final Presentation
Your Final Presentation should include:
Share Price Index Improvement: As discussed above, there are two aspects to this: weekly
improvement for periods 1-7 and the final performance (after period 8) compared to your starting
value in period 0.
Team Presentation: A powerpoint presentation will be created and submitted by each team at
the end of the semester about your strategy, decision making and performance in the MarkStrat

A word about the “W” course and work load
This truly is a 15-week course compressed into a 6-week online, summer course. If you expect
to be very busy with other responsibilities or commitments, then we need to talk about whether or
not you should continue in the course in Week 1. Given that case assignments and team decisions
for the simulation can’t be duplicated or made up, it would be difficult to be fully engaged each
week to complete the course work or in your team if you are not available often for group work
and participation, and frequent absences from those meetings will make it impossible to earn a

SMEAL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICIES
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
According to the Penn State Principles and University Code of Conduct:
Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in
an open, honest, and responsible manner. According to the University’s Code of Conduct, you must neither engage in nor tolerate
academic dishonesty. This includes, but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, fabrication of information or citations, facilitating acts of
academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person, or work previously used in
another course without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students.
 Any violation of academic integrity will be investigated and, where warranted, corrective academic and/or disciplinary action will
be taken. For every incident where a penalty is assessed, an Academic Integrity Incident Report form must be filed. The form can be
found on the Smeal College Honor and Integrity website: https://www.smeal.psu.edu/integrity. This form is to be used for
undergraduate courses. The report must be signed and dated by both the instructor and the student, and then submitted to Monica
Snyder, 202 Business Building.
University Policy G-9
“Once a student has been informed that academic misconduct is suspected, the student may not drop the course during the adjudication
process. The Dean of the College (UP) and/or the Chancellor (campuses) or his or her representative is responsible for notifying the Office
of the University Registrar when academic misconduct is suspected in a course. Any drop or withdrawal from the course during this time
will be reversed. A student who has received an academic sanction as a result of a violation of academic integrity may not drop or
withdraw from the course at any time. These drop actions include regular drop, late drop, withdrawal, retroactive late drop and retroactive
withdrawal. Any such drop action of the course will be reversed. This drop policy may be superseded in exceptional circumstances (i.e.
trauma drop). In these cases, the Office of Student Conduct or the Student Conduct designee will confer with the Dean of the College (UP)
or the Chancellor (campuses) or his or her representative to determine if the drop is warranted.

satisfactory performance ratings by your team members as completed in a peer evaluation survey.
Deadlines
Students are responsible for all information disseminated in class, by Email, or on Canvas, and for all
course requirements, including meeting deadlines and examinations. Late submissions are acceptable
only upon the instructor’s prior permission. A 10% penalty is implemented, possibly each week, if an
assignment is late. If the student is unable to meet the deadline due to absence from class approved by
the instructor, the student is expected to turn in the assignment PRIOR to his or her leave.
WRITING GUIDELINES:
All writings should be typed and follow this format: 1.5 line spacing, 12-point Times New Roman
font, one-inch margins, and discipline-appropriate citations. MS Office uses a default of 1.5""

Wikipedia page to read about a topic or gain some ideas and information, but you must go to the
official sources listed below the Wikipedia and click on those to read and officially use in your work.
Points will be deducted for using Wikipedia as a reference.
ASSIGNMENTS/SIMULATION
Quizzes
See schedule for quizzes to be used in class to assess your understanding of the articles. Quizzes will
be administered on the course website. I will let you know the details on Canvas.
Individual Plans of Action (POAs) (Best 2 of 3 available):
A Plan of Action (POA) provides your analysis of a case and your action plan to solve the business
problem described in a case. Specific guidelines for writing a POA will be provided in CANVAS as
well as discussed in class.
Your lowest grade of the first two individual POAs will be dropped. You must complete all case
POAs, the last cannot be dropped. The group POA cannot be dropped. Any 0 score for a failed
submission is not eligible to be considered as one of your lowest grades to drop. You cannot “skip” a
POA assignment. See schedule for when POAs are due in Canvas.
A note on Plagiarism
Your instructor or the teaching assistant will upload all POAs written into Turnitin, the plagiarism
detection system, using the electronic copy you provide. Turnitin will produce an Originality Report
for each of your papers submitted. Turnitin will detect any plagiarism from outside sources found on
the Internet, in papers turned in during prior semesters, or in papers turned in at other schools.
For this reason, no grades given for your POAs will be completely official until you have submitted an
electronic copy of your paper into the course website and Turnitin has detected no problems with
originality. Please refer to the discussion on plagiarism at the back of this course outline for more
insight into why plagiarism is such a concern.
MarkStrat Simulation
During the course, you will get the opportunity to decide on strategic marketing issues such as
branding, positioning, marketing research, and new product development, in a simulation game. In

4
order to let you integrate the ideas presented in your previous marketing courses, we will use an online
marketing simulation game called MarkStrat. MarkStrat focuses on the strategic marketing strategy of
a firm active in consumer durables.
The simulation is a large part of the course workload. The MarkStrat assignments are done in teams.
Each team will assume the role of the top management of a firm in a computer simulated industrial
environment, and will make strategy decisions for eight periods in time representing eight years of the
firm’s existence. I will begin the actual simulation with a limited set of decisions you can make, and
then extend your strategic scope as you progress in the simulation. Because this is an online course, I
will assign you the teams.
Depending on the size of the class, there will be one or two identical industries in this class, each with
four companies competing within the industry. The teams within each industry will have different but
comparable starting points, and you will compete directly with each other.
Your overall goal will be to improve your Share Price Index over the course of the eight periods (or
years). This improvement will be measured in two different ways:
 The weekly performance in terms of Share Price Index improvement versus the previous
period (for periods 1-5);
 The final performance (after Period 6) in terms of Share Price Index improvement versus the
starting value in Period 0.
In addition to the performance in the simulation, I value your learning process. You will deliver a final
presentation powerpoint voiceover that will review the strategy you followed, what worked well, what
did not work well, what you learned, and your advice to a new management team taking over the firm.
Final Presentation
Your Final Presentation should include:
Share Price Index Improvement: As discussed above, there are two aspects to this: weekly
improvement for periods 1-7 and the final performance (after period 8) compared to your starting
value in period 0.
Team Presentation: A powerpoint presentation will be created and submitted by each team at
the end of the semester about your strategy, decision making and performance in the MarkStrat
Simulation. More details on the presentation to be announced mid-semester.

Share Price Index Improvement: As discussed above, there are two aspects to this: weekly
improvement for periods 1-7 and the final performance (after period 8) compared to your starting
value in period 0.
Team Presentation: A powerpoint presentation will be created and submitted by each team at
the end of the semester about your strategy, decision making and performance in the MarkStrat
Simulation. More details on the presentation to be announced mid-semester.
A word about the “W” course and work load
This truly is a 15-week course compressed into a 6-week online, summer course. If you expect
to be very busy with other responsibilities or commitments, then we need to talk about whether or
not you should continue in the course in Week 1. Given that case assignments and team decisions
for the simulation can’t be duplicated or made up, it would be difficult to be fully engaged each
week to complete the course work or in your team if you are not available often for group work
and participation, and frequent absences from those meetings will make it impossible to earn a

needs to be a top priority in order to successfully earn a passing grade.
SMEAL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICIES
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
According to the Penn State Principles and University Code of Conduct:
Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in
an open, honest, and responsible manner. According to the University’s Code of Conduct, you must neither engage in nor tolerate
academic dishonesty. This includes, but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, fabrication of information or citations, facilitating acts of
academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person, or work previously used in
another course without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students.
 Any violation of academic integrity will be investigated and, where warranted, corrective academic and/or disciplinary action will
be taken. For every incident where a penalty is assessed, an Academic Integrity Incident Report form must be filed. The form can be
found on the Smeal College Honor and Integrity website: https://www.smeal.psu.edu/integrity. This form is to be used for
undergraduate courses. The report must be signed and dated by both the instructor and the student, and then submitted to Monica
Snyder, 202 Business Building.
University Policy G-9
“Once a student has been informed that academic misconduct is suspected, the student may not drop the course during the adjudication
process. The Dean of the College (UP) and/or the Chancellor (campuses) or his or her representative is responsible for notifying the Office
of the University Registrar when academic misconduct is suspected in a course. Any drop or withdrawal from the course during this time
will be reversed. A student who has received an academic sanction as a result of a violation of academic integrity may not drop or
withdraw from the course at any time. These drop actions include regular drop, late drop, withdrawal, retroactive late drop and retroactive
withdrawal. Any such drop action of the course will be reversed. This drop policy may be superseded in exceptional circumstances (i.e.
trauma drop). In these cases, the Office of Student Conduct or the Student Conduct designee will confer with the Dean of the College (UP)
or the Chancellor (campuses) or his or her representative to determine if the drop is warranted.
University Policy G-9 http://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html
Smeal Honor Code:
We, the Smeal College of Business Community, aspire to the highest ethical standards and will hold each other accountable to them. We
will not engage in any action that is improper or that creates the appearance of impropriety in our academic lives, and we intend to hold to
this standard in our future careers.
PLAGIARISM / COPYING
All work you submit for grading or academic credit is designed to reflect your knowledge and skill related to the course subject matter.
Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, all work submitted is to be done on an individual basis. This includes but is not limited to all exams,
quizzes, homework, papers, written assignments, and presentations.
Plagiarism is claiming work as your own that you have copied from another person, whether that other person knows about it or not. This
includes copying from web sites without proper source citation and using homework or papers prepared by current or past students
whether working as an individual or working in a group / team.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION & SEXUAL HARASSMENT
The Pennsylvania State University is committed to a policy where all persons shall have equal access to programs, facilities, admission,
and employment without regard to personal characteristics not related to ability, performance, or qualifications as determined by University
policy or by Commonwealth or Federal authorities. Penn State does not discriminate against any person because of age, ancestry, color,
disability or handicap, national origin, race, religious creed, gender, sexual orientation, or veteran status. Related inquiries should be
directed to the Affirmative Action Office, 328 Boucke Building.

Penn State and the Smeal College of Business welcomes students with disabilities to all of its classes, programs and events. Student
Disability Resources in Room 116 Boucke Building provides a vast array of services for students with disabilities according to mandates
under Title II of the ADA amendments Act of 2008 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. For more information or to meet with
a service provider from Student Disability Resources, contact them at (814) 863-1807 (V/TTY) or visit their website at:
http://equity.psu.edu/sdr
In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus
enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/applying-for-services If the documentation
supports your request for reasonable accommodations, the Student Disability Resources office will provide you with an accommodation
letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in the course as possible.
Adjustments will be made based on the recommendations in the accommodation letter. You must follow this process for every semester
that you request accommodations.

articulate our ethical principles and should guide our actions and decisions as members of the Penn State community, including in this
course:
Integrity: We act with integrity and honesty in accordance with the highest academic, professional, and ethical standards.
Respect: We respect and honor the dignity of each person, embrace civil discourse, and foster a diverse and inclusive

Overview

ENGL 202C, Technical Writing, serves students who are studying and preparing for careers in the sciences and applied sciences, including engineering. This advanced course in writing familiarizes students with the discourse practices prized in their disciplinary and institutional communities—and helps them to manage those practices effectively in their own written work. In this way the course teaches those writing strategies and tactics that scientists, engineers, and others will need in order to write successfully on the job.

Requirements
OBTAIN TEXTBOOK.
Technical Communication by Mike Markel and Stuart A. Selber. Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2018. 12th edition. E-book.

ATTEND CLASS.
You are expected to attend class every day and to have your work with you. Regular attendance is required, because course instruction depends on your active participation. You may be absent from up to two class sessions with no penalty and no explanation necessary (unless you miss a rough draft session—a major problem); but try to limit it to that. Indeed, why not attend every meeting? Excused absences are appropriate, of course, but beyond that, let me repeat English department policy: A student whose absences are excessive “may run the risk of receiving a lower grade or a failing grade,” whether some of those absences are considered “excused” or not. If you miss class, it is your responsibility to get assignments, complete any work, and submit any due assignments.

It is particularly important for you to attend—and be prepared to participate in—in-class workshops on drafts of your documents. The more you have written before peer-review sessions, the more you will benefit from them. Although your drafts need not be “polished,” in general they should be complete enough for you to receive substantial help from your peers. Under no circumstances will I accept a “final” version of a document unless I have seen rough drafts. In addition, you must hand in all assignments in order to pass the course.

COMPLETE ASSIGNMENTS AND QUIZZES.
(more on this later).

ENGAGE WITH THE CLASS AND THE MATERIAL.
In addition to the requirements outlined above, you are expected to work until the class period has ended; to complete all reading assignments on time; to help your classmates learn by your responses to their writing; to choose projects that require significant research and analysis; to spend at least six hours per week out of class for writing and class preparation; and to be courteous and considerate. 

Assignments
QUALITY AND STANDARDS
In this course, I will try to hold you to the professional standards that prevail in your field. For example, of the requirements listed below, your employer will take some completely for granted, such as promptness, neat appearance, and correct mechanics.

Promptness: In this course, as in the working world, you must turn in your work on time. All projects are due at the beginning of class on the dates indicated on the syllabus. Assignments turned in late will be penalized one letter grade for each day late unless you have made other arrangements with me in advance.

Appearance: All work should be neatly prepared on a computer, using margins and spacing and design techniques that are conventional for the genre. Whether it is a resume, memo, or report, your communication should exhibit complete and appropriate format. All writing for the course should be printed clearly, including draft work, unless otherwise noted.

Grammar, Spelling, Proofreading: At work, even a single error in spelling, grammar, or proofreading can jeopardize the effectiveness of some communications. Grading will reflect the great seriousness with which these matters are frequently viewed in the working world. If you would like special assistance with any of these skills, I can recommend sources for extra help.

Back-up Copies: Always back-up your electronic files. Sometimes I will request a copy of one of your documents so that I can use it as a sample, to illustrate effective and problematic responses to assignments. Unless I completely obliterate any marks that might identify it as yours, I will never use your work in class without your permission.

Revisions: You will receive feedback on your writing at various stages of the writing process. You should try to apply the comments to improve not only the particular assignment you are working on at the time but also your strategies for writing in general.

ASSIGNMENT GRADING STANDARDS
Of each assignment’s potential 100 points, 95 are determined by your final submitted assignment. 5 are determined by your timely and satisfactory submissions of any required process work (e.g. proposals and drafts).

When grading each of your final submissions, I will ask one overriding question: “Does this document do its job successfully?” That is, would your communication have the intended effect on the reader you are addressing. I will, of course, recognize the difference between a competent performance (a “C”) and good and superior performances (“B” and “A”). A competent performance is one that stands a chance of succeeding; an excellent performance is one that seems assured not only of success but also of winning praise. Each grade below indicates a percent value that will be applied to the assignment in Canvas. -/+ will be applied to submissions that fall slightly above or below the standards descriptions for the whole letter grades.

A: Superior. (100%) The work is of near professional quality. The document meets or exceeds all the objectives of the assignment. The content is mature, thorough, and well-suited for the audience; the style is clear, accurate, and forceful; the information is well-organized and designed so that it is accessible and attractive; the mechanics and grammar are correct.

A- (93.99%)

B+ (89.99%)

B: Good. (86.99%) The document meets the objectives of the assignment, but it needs improvement in style, or it contains easily correctable errors in grammar, format, or content, or its content is superficial.

B- (83.99%)

C+ (79.99%)

C: Competent. (76.99%) The document needs significant improvement in concept, details, development, organization, grammar, or format. It may be formally correct but superficial in content.

D: Marginally acceptable. (69.99%) The document meets some of the objectives but ignores others; the content is inadequately developed; or it contains numerous or major errors.

F: Unacceptable. (59.99%) The document does not have enough information, does something other than the assignment required, or it contains major errors or excessive errors.

REWRITING AN ASSIGNMENT
You may rewrite and resubmit one assignment. That assignment must have earned a grade of B or lower, and it cannot be the final assignment due to Final Grade submission deadlines. To re-write an assignment, e-mail me to schedule a meeting. We will meet to determine a revision plan and a reasonable due date. If the resubmitted assignment earns a higher grade than the original grade, it will replace the original grade. If it earns a lower grade, then the original grade stands.

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS
As assignments are introduced, instructions for each will be linked below. Copies will also be posted in the corresponding Canvas Assignment page. Below are general descriptions.

Basic Rhetorical Analysis: Technical communication is meant to be used and not just read. Good technical communication communicates information to an audience who will act on that information in a variety of ways: in making hiring decisions, in following technical procedures, in developing research plans, and more. In this assignment, you will evaluate the usability of a piece of technical communication—that is, you will analyze whether the document effectively communicates the necessary information to its audience and where it fails to do so. In this way, the assignment will introduce you to basic elements of technical communication. 

Job Application Package: The process of applying for a job is an extremely important scenario for technical communication. As a job applicant, you have a vested interest in communicating your suitability for the position with the specific audience making employment decisions. This assignment will ask you to create resumes and application documents attuned to the rhetorical situations of two actual job offerings in your field. You will also discuss your writing and communication decisions in a reflective memo.

Technical Definition and Description: Engineers and scientists are often required to describe a technical object, concept, or process to someone who has little knowledge or experience with the subject at hand. For example, an engineering firm might write a proposal to bid on a contract to develop a helicopter for the Defense Department; one section of the proposal would be a detailed description of the product the company proposes to develop. Technical descriptions are used before products and processes are developed (as part of proposals and planning documents), during development (in progress reports, for instance), and afterwards (as part of marketing and promotional literature and technical support documents). You will write a technical definition for an object, concept, or process in your field.

Instruction Set: Instruction sets are common technical documents for many disciplines and occupations. Employees read instructions to learn how to assemble a product or complete a procedure. Supervisors write out company policies that oftentimes serve as instruction sets. Customers read instructions for using a product. You will develop a set of instructions advising users to perform a specific task.        

E-Portfolio: Electronic portfolios are an increasingly common vehicle for developing a professional online identity. Professionals are beginning to create them and employers are beginning to expect them. Employers are interested in e-portfolios for a variety of reasons: they provide multiple writing samples, display skills with computers and new media, and require reflection and meta-knowledge. Professionals like e-portfolios because they help them keep track of their projects and accomplishments. As a final course assignment, you will design an e-portfolio using the Penn State WordPress environment. The portfolio will include work from this course and from others. You will create your e-portfolio for an audience of potential employers.

Reading Quizzes
You will complete ten in-class, unannounced reading quizzes on Canvas throughout the semester. If you must be absent on a quiz day, you can make up the quiz by submitting it on Canvas within 7 days from the date/time that the quiz was assigned. Canvas will automatically drop your lowest quiz result (i.e., only your nine best quiz results will count towards your grade).

Class Participation
Your participation is integral to the success of this course. You will help your fellow writers, and you will make the class that much more engaging and stimulating for both of us (I don’t want to hear me talk for 75 minutes non-stop, and I assume you don’t either). Ask questions. Voice your observations. Listen to and respond to your fellow classmates. If you are uncomfortable participating during class, bring your questions and observations to me during Office Hours. I will take this into account when considering your participation grade.

Note that use of personal technology like smartphones and headphones during class is prohibited, and may affect your participation grade. Laptops and tablets are permitted, but as with using the lab computers, you are expected to work only on material that we are working on in class that day. Doing otherwise (e.g. using personal e-mail, social network sites, or working on material for other classes) may affect your participation grade.

At the mid-point of the semester, you will receive a participation grade that counts for 0 points. This will provide a status update on how you are doing, and incentivize you to either increase your participation, or continue the good work that you’re doing.

After the course ends, I will evaluate your participation throughout the whole semester and indicate the corresponding grade in Canvas.

As a guideline, here is a rubric for participation grades.

A: Participates or offers to participate multiple times per class. Insightful comments using terms and concepts from the readings and other classes. Very attentive and engaged in the particulars of the class discussion. Makes substantial contributions in group activities.
A-
B+
B: Participates or offers to participate once per class. Offers insightful comments, though occasionally too general or not relevant. Attentive. Actively contributes to group activities.
B-
C+
C: Participates or offers to participate during half the class meetings. Offers occasionally constructive comments. At times inattentive. Occasionally uses computers for tasks unrelated to the class meeting. Participates a minimal amount in group activities.
D: Doesn’t participate unless specifically asked to do so. Offers comments heavily driven by personal opinion, with minimal relation to the current discussion. Generally inattentive. Often uses computers for tasks unrelated to the class meeting. Speaks while others are talking. Nods off during class. Does not participate in group activities.
F: Refuses to participate. Disrupts class or is disrespectful of other classmates. Frequently sleeps during class. Disrupts group activities. Excessive absences from class.

Your Final Grade
WEIGHTING OF ASSIGNMENTS, QUIZZES, AND PARTICIPATION
Your final grade will be determined by the grades you receive on written and in-class assignments, according to the following weighting:

Basic Rhetorical Analysis, 15%

Job Application Package, 15%

Technical Definition and Description, 15%

Instruction Set, 15%

E-Portfolio, 20%

Reading Quizzes, 10%

Class Participation, 10%

GRADING SCHEME
Canvas will apply the above weighting to determine points earned in each evaluated component of the course. The below grading scheme will be applied in Canvas to calculate your final grade. 

Because you build your Final Grade through your performance in each component of the course, I will not round Final Grade number values up or down. For example, 93.5 is less than 94.0, so that’s an A-; 69.9 is less than 70.0, so that’s a D.

100 to 94.0 is an A
<94.0 to 90.0 is an A-
<90.0 to 87.0 is a B+
<87.0 to 84.0 is a B
<84.0 to 80.0 is a B-
<80.0 to 77.0 is a C+
<77.0 to 70.0 is a C
<70.0 to 50.0 is a D
<60.0 to 0.0 is an F

Office Hours
See me when you have questions about an assignment, when you would like to try out some ideas before a document is due, or when you have questions about a comment. You should also see me to get help with particular writing problems, to resolve differences about grades, or to suggest ways to improve the course.

Policy Statements
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.

Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

Do not risk failing this course due to a short-sighted lapse in judgment.

ACCESSIBILITY: DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Student Disability Resources Web site provides contact information for every Penn State campus (equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/disability-coordinator). For further information, please visit the Student Disability Resources website (equity.psu.edu/sdr).

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation (equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/applying-for-services). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

EDUCATION EQUITY: BIAS REPORTING
Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated and can be reported through Educational Equity via the Report Bias webpage (equity.psu.edu/reportbias/).

COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.

STANDARDS OF CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR 
Classroom behavior should always reflect the essential Penn State values of civility, integrity, and respect for the dignity and rights of others. As such, the classroom space should be safe, orderly, and positive—free from disruptions, disorderly conduct, and harassment as defined in the University Code of Conduct (studentaffairs.psu.edu/support-safety-conduct/student-conduct/code-conduct). The University Code of Conduct defines disruption “as an action or combination of actions by one or more individuals that unreasonably interferes with, hinders, obstructs, or prevents the operation of the University or infringes on the rights of others to freely participate in its programs and services;” disorderly conduct includes but is not limited to “creating unreasonable noise; pushing and shoving; creating a physically hazardous or physically offensive condition;” and harassment may include “directing physical or verbal conduct at an individual…; subjecting a person or group of persons to unwanted physical contact or threat of such; or engaging in a course of conduct, including following the person without proper authority (e.g., stalking), under circumstances which would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or to suffer emotional distress” (Section IV, B). The course instructor has the authority to request that any disruptive students leave the class for the class period. If disruptive behavior continues in subsequent class periods, a complaint may be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which may result in the student being dismissed from class until University procedures have been completed. Any student with concerns or questions as to this policy should contact the Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric.

Syllabus built upon the Spring 2019 Penn State Program in Writing and Rhetoric 202C Syllabus Template by Stuart Selber.

Overview

ENGL 202C, Technical Writing, serves students who are studying and preparing for careers in the sciences and applied sciences, including engineering. This advanced course in writing familiarizes students with the discourse practices prized in their disciplinary and institutional communities—and helps them to manage those practices effectively in their own written work. In this way the course teaches those writing strategies and tactics that scientists, engineers, and others will need in order to write successfully on the job. 

Accordingly, students in the course can expect to:

Discover and understand the discourse features that distinguish their disciplinary and institutional communities from others.

Discover and specify the purpose(s) of their writing.

Develop a range of writing processes appropriate to various writing tasks.

Identify their readers and describe the characteristics of their readers in a way that forms a sound basis for deciding how to write to them.

Invent the contents of their communications through research and reflection.

Arrange material to raise and satisfy readers’ expectations, using both conventional and rhetorical patterns of organization.

Reveal the organization of their communications by using forecasting and transitional statements, headings, and effective page and document design.

Observe appropriate generic conventions and formats for technical documents.

Design and use tables, graphs, and technical illustrations.

Compose effective sentences.

Evaluate their documents to be sure that the documents fulfill their purpose and to ensure that they can be revised if necessary. 

Collaborate effectively with their peers in a community of writers who provide feedback on each others’ work and occasionally write together.

Write several specific kinds of documents that recur in technical, scientific, and other communities.

Employ computer technology effectively in the solution of communication problems.

Communicate in an ethically responsible manner.

Basic Rhetorical Analysis: Technical communication is meant to be used and not just read. Good technical communication communicates information to an audience who will act on that information in a variety of ways: in making hiring decisions, in following technical procedures, in developing research plans, and more. In this assignment, you will evaluate the usability of a piece of technical communication—that is, you will analyze whether the document effectively communicates the necessary information to its audience and where it fails to do so. In this way, the assignment will introduce you to basic elements of technical communication. 

Job Application Package: The process of applying for a job is an extremely important scenario for technical communication. As a job applicant, you have a vested interest in communicating your suitability for the position with the specific audience making employment decisions. This assignment will ask you to create resumes and application documents attuned to the rhetorical situations of two actual job offerings in your field. You will also discuss your writing and communication decisions in a reflective memo.

Technical Definition and Description: Engineers and scientists are often required to describe a technical object, concept, or process to someone who has little knowledge or experience with the subject at hand. For example, an engineering firm might write a proposal to bid on a contract to develop a helicopter for the Defense Department; one section of the proposal would be a detailed description of the product the company proposes to develop. Technical descriptions are used before products and processes are developed (as part of proposals and planning documents), during development (in progress reports, for instance), and afterwards (as part of marketing and promotional literature and technical support documents). You will write a technical definition for an object, concept, or process in your field.

Instruction Set: Instruction sets are common technical documents for many disciplines and occupations. Employees read instructions to learn how to assemble a product or complete a procedure. Supervisors write out company policies that oftentimes serve as instruction sets. Customers read instructions for using a product. You will develop a set of instructions advising users to perform a specific task.        

E-Portfolio: Electronic portfolios are an increasingly common vehicle for developing a professional online identity. Professionals are beginning to create them and employers are beginning to expect them. Employers are interested in e-portfolios for a variety of reasons: they provide multiple writing samples, display skills with computers and new media, and require reflection and meta-knowledge. Professionals like e-portfolios because they help them keep track of their projects and accomplishments. As a final course assignment, you will design an e-portfolio using the Penn State WordPress environment. The portfolio will include work from this course and from others. You will create your e-portfolio for an audience of potential employers.

Reading Quizzes
You will complete ten in-class, unannounced reading quizzes on Canvas throughout the semester. If you must be absent on a quiz day, you can make up the quiz by submitting it on Canvas within 7 days from the date/time that the quiz was assigned. Canvas will automatically drop your lowest quiz result (i.e., only your nine best quiz results will count towards your grade).

Class Participation
Your participation is integral to the success of this course. You will help your fellow writers, and you will make the class that much more engaging and stimulating for both of us (I don’t want to hear me talk for 75 minutes non-stop, and I assume you don’t either). Ask questions. Voice your observations. Listen to and respond to your fellow classmates. If you are uncomfortable participating during class, bring your questions and observations to me during Office Hours. I will take this into account when considering your participation grade.

Note that use of personal technology like smartphones and headphones during class is prohibited, and may affect your participation grade. Laptops and tablets are permitted, but as with using the lab computers, you are expected to work only on material that we are working on in class that day. Doing otherwise (e.g. using personal e-mail, social network sites, or working on material for other classes) may affect your participation grade.

At the mid-point of the semester, you will receive a participation grade that counts for 0 points. This will provide a status update on how you are doing, and incentivize you to either increase your participation, or continue the good work that you’re doing.

After the course ends, I will evaluate your participation throughout the whole semester and indicate the corresponding grade in Canvas.

As a guideline, here is a rubric for participation grades.

A: Participates or offers to participate multiple times per class. Insightful comments using terms and concepts from the readings and other classes. Very attentive and engaged in the particulars of the class discussion. Makes substantial contributions in group activities.
A-
B+
B: Participates or offers to participate once per class. Offers insightful comments, though occasionally too general or not relevant. Attentive. Actively contributes to group activities.
B-
C+
C: Participates or offers to participate during half the class meetings. Offers occasionally constructive comments. At times inattentive. Occasionally uses computers for tasks unrelated to the class meeting. Participates a minimal amount in group activities.
D: Doesn’t participate unless specifically asked to do so. Offers comments heavily driven by personal opinion, with minimal relation to the current discussion. Generally inattentive. Often uses computers for tasks unrelated to the class meeting. Speaks while others are talking. Nods off during class. Does not participate in group activities.
F: Refuses to participate. Disrupts class or is disrespectful of other classmates. Frequently sleeps during class. Disrupts group activities. Excessive absences from class.

Your Final Grade
WEIGHTING OF ASSIGNMENTS, QUIZZES, AND PARTICIPATION
Your final grade will be determined by the grades you receive on written and in-class assignments, according to the following weighting:

Basic Rhetorical Analysis, 15%

Job Application Package, 15%

Technical Definition and Description, 15%

Instruction Set, 15%

E-Portfolio, 20%

Reading Quizzes, 10%

Class Participation, 10%

GRADING SCHEME
Canvas will apply the above weighting to determine points earned in each evaluated component of the course. The below grading scheme will be applied in Canvas to calculate your final grade. 

Because you build your Final Grade through your performance in each component of the course, I will not round Final Grade number values up or down. For example, 93.5 is less than 94.0, so that’s an A-; 69.9 is less than 70.0, so that’s a D.

100 to 94.0 is an A
<94.0 to 90.0 is an A-
<90.0 to 87.0 is a B+
<87.0 to 84.0 is a B
<84.0 to 80.0 is a B-
<80.0 to 77.0 is a C+
<77.0 to 70.0 is a C
<70.0 to 50.0 is a D
<60.0 to 0.0 is an F

Office Hours
See me when you have questions about an assignment, when you would like to try out some ideas before a document is due, or when you have questions about a comment. You should also see me to get help with particular writing problems, to resolve differences about grades, or to suggest ways to improve the course.

Policy Statements
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.

Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

Do not risk failing this course due to a short-sighted lapse in judgment.

ACCESSIBILITY: DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Student Disability Resources Web site provides contact information for every Penn State campus (equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/disability-coordinator). For further information, please visit the Student Disability Resources website (equity.psu.edu/sdr).

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation (equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/applying-for-services). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

EDUCATION EQUITY: BIAS REPORTING
Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated and can be reported through Educational Equity via the Report Bias webpage (equity.psu.edu/reportbias/).

COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.

STANDARDS OF CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR 
Classroom behavior should always reflect the essential Penn State values of civility, integrity, and respect for the dignity and rights of others. As such, the classroom space should be safe, orderly, and positive—free from disruptions, disorderly conduct, and harassment as defined in the University Code of Conduct (studentaffairs.psu.edu/support-safety-conduct/student-conduct/code-conduct). The University Code of Conduct defines disruption “as an action or combination of actions by one or more individuals that unreasonably interferes with, hinders, obstructs, or prevents the operation of the University or infringes on the rights of others to freely participate in its programs and services;” disorderly conduct includes but is not limited to “creating unreasonable noise; pushing and shoving; creating a physically hazardous or physically offensive condition;” and harassment may include “directing physical or verbal conduct at an individual…; subjecting a person or group of persons to unwanted physical contact or threat of such; or engaging in a course of conduct, including following the person without proper authority (e.g., stalking), under circumstances which would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or to suffer emotional distress” (Section IV, B). The course instructor has the authority to request that any disruptive students leave the class for the class period. If disruptive behavior continues in subsequent class periods, a complaint may be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which may result in the student being dismissed from class until University procedures have been completed. Any student with concerns or questions as to this policy should contact the Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric.

Syllabus built upon the Spring 2019 Penn State Program in Writing and Rhetoric 202C Syllabus Template by Stuart Selber.

Overview

ENGL 202C, Technical Writing, serves students who are studying and preparing for careers in the sciences and applied sciences, including engineering. This advanced course in writing familiarizes students with the discourse practices prized in their disciplinary and institutional communities—and helps them to manage those practices effectively in their own written work. In this way the course teaches those writing strategies and tactics that scientists, engineers, and others will need in order to write successfully on the job. 

Accordingly, students in the course can expect to:

Discover and understand the discourse features that distinguish their disciplinary and institutional communities from others.

Discover and specify the purpose(s) of their writing.

Develop a range of writing processes appropriate to various writing tasks.

Identify their readers and describe the characteristics of their readers in a way that forms a sound basis for deciding how to write to them.

Invent the contents of their communications through research and reflection.

Arrange material to raise and satisfy readers’ expectations, using both conventional and rhetorical patterns of organization.

Reveal the organization of their communications by using forecasting and transitional statements, headings, and effective page and document design.

Observe appropriate generic conventions and formats for technical documents.

Design and use tables, graphs, and technical illustrations.

Compose effective sentences.

Evaluate their documents to be sure that the documents fulfill their purpose and to ensure that they can be revised if necessary. 

Collaborate effectively with their peers in a community of writers who provide feedback on each others’ work and occasionally write together.

Write several specific kinds of documents that recur in technical, scientific, and other communities.

Employ computer technology effectively in the solution of communication problems.

Communicate in an ethically responsible manner.

Requirements
OBTAIN TEXTBOOK.
Technical Communication by Mike Markel and Stuart A. Selber. Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2018. 12th edition. E-book.

ATTEND CLASS.
You are expected to attend class every day and to have your work with you. Regular attendance is required, because course instruction depends on your active participation. You may be absent from up to two class sessions with no penalty and no explanation necessary (unless you miss a rough draft session—a major problem); but try to limit it to that. Indeed, why not attend every meeting? Excused absences are appropriate, of course, but beyond that, let me repeat English department policy: A student whose absences are excessive “may run the risk of receiving a lower grade or a failing grade,” whether some of those absences are considered “excused” or not. If you miss class, it is your responsibility to get assignments, complete any work, and submit any due assignments.

It is particularly important for you to attend—and be prepared to participate in—in-class workshops on drafts of your documents. The more you have written before peer-review sessions, the more you will benefit from them. Although your drafts need not be “polished,” in general they should be complete enough for you to receive substantial help from your peers. Under no circumstances will I accept a “final” version of a document unless I have seen rough drafts. In addition, you must hand in all assignments in order to pass the course.

COMPLETE ASSIGNMENTS AND QUIZZES.
(more on this later).

ENGAGE WITH THE CLASS AND THE MATERIAL.
In addition to the requirements outlined above, you are expected to work until the class period has ended; to complete all reading assignments on time; to help your classmates learn by your responses to their writing; to choose projects that require significant research and analysis; to spend at least six hours per week out of class for writing and class preparation; and to be courteous and considerate. 

Assignments
QUALITY AND STANDARDS
In this course, I will try to hold you to the professional standards that prevail in your field. For example, of the requirements listed below, your employer will take some completely for granted, such as promptness, neat appearance, and correct mechanics.

Promptness: In this course, as in the working world, you must turn in your work on time. All projects are due at the beginning of class on the dates indicated on the syllabus. Assignments turned in late will be penalized one letter grade for each day late unless you have made other arrangements with me in advance.

Appearance: All work should be neatly prepared on a computer, using margins and spacing and design techniques that are conventional for the genre. Whether it is a resume, memo, or report, your communication should exhibit complete and appropriate format. All writing for the course should be printed clearly, including draft work, unless otherwise noted.

Grammar, Spelling, Proofreading: At work, even a single error in spelling, grammar, or proofreading can jeopardize the effectiveness of some communications. Grading will reflect the great seriousness with which these matters are frequently viewed in the working world. If you would like special assistance with any of these skills, I can recommend sources for extra help.

Back-up Copies: Always back-up your electronic files. Sometimes I will request a copy of one of your documents so that I can use it as a sample, to illustrate effective and problematic responses to assignments. Unless I completely obliterate any marks that might identify it as yours, I will never use your work in class without your permission.

Revisions: You will receive feedback on your writing at various stages of the writing process. You should try to apply the comments to improve not only the particular assignment you are working on at the time but also your strategies for writing in general.

ASSIGNMENT GRADING STANDARDS
Of each assignment’s potential 100 points, 95 are determined by your final submitted assignment. 5 are determined by your timely and satisfactory submissions of any required process work (e.g. proposals and drafts).

When grading each of your final submissions, I will ask one overriding question: “Does this document do its job successfully?” That is, would your communication have the intended effect on the reader you are addressing. I will, of course, recognize the difference between a competent performance (a “C”) and good and superior performances (“B” and “A”). A competent performance is one that stands a chance of succeeding; an excellent performance is one that seems assured not only of success but also of winning praise. Each grade below indicates a percent value that will be applied to the assignment in Canvas. -/+ will be applied to submissions that fall slightly above or below the standards descriptions for the whole letter grades.

A: Superior. (100%) The work is of near professional quality. The document meets or exceeds all the objectives of the assignment. The content is mature, thorough, and well-suited for the audience; the style is clear, accurate, and forceful; the information is well-organized and designed so that it is accessible and attractive; the mechanics and grammar are correct.

A- (93.99%)

B+ (89.99%)

B: Good. (86.99%) The document meets the objectives of the assignment, but it needs improvement in style, or it contains easily correctable errors in grammar, format, or content, or its content is superficial.

B- (83.99%)

C+ (79.99%)

C: Competent. (76.99%) The document needs significant improvement in concept, details, development, organization, grammar, or format. It may be formally correct but superficial in content.

D: Marginally acceptable. (69.99%) The document meets some of the objectives but ignores others; the content is inadequately developed; or it contains numerous or major errors.

F: Unacceptable. (59.99%) The document does not have enough information, does something other than the assignment required, or it contains major errors or excessive errors.

REWRITING AN ASSIGNMENT
You may rewrite and resubmit one assignment. That assignment must have earned a grade of B or lower, and it cannot be the final assignment due to Final Grade submission deadlines. To re-write an assignment, e-mail me to schedule a meeting. We will meet to determine a revision plan and a reasonable due date. If the resubmitted assignment earns a higher grade than the original grade, it will replace the original grade. If it earns a lower grade, then the original grade stands.

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS
As assignments are introduced, instructions for each will be linked below. Copies will also be posted in the corresponding Canvas Assignment page. Below are general descriptions.

Basic Rhetorical Analysis: Technical communication is meant to be used and not just read. Good technical communication communicates information to an audience who will act on that information in a variety of ways: in making hiring decisions, in following technical procedures, in developing research plans, and more. In this assignment, you will evaluate the usability of a piece of technical communication—that is, you will analyze whether the document effectively communicates the necessary information to its audience and where it fails to do so. In this way, the assignment will introduce you to basic elements of technical communication. 

Job Application Package: The process of applying for a job is an extremely important scenario for technical communication. As a job applicant, you have a vested interest in communicating your suitability for the position with the specific audience making employment decisions. This assignment will ask you to create resumes and application documents attuned to the rhetorical situations of two actual job offerings in your field. You will also discuss your writing and communication decisions in a reflective memo.

Technical Definition and Description: Engineers and scientists are often required to describe a technical object, concept, or process to someone who has little knowledge or experience with the subject at hand. For example, an engineering firm might write a proposal to bid on a contract to develop a helicopter for the Defense Department; one section of the proposal would be a detailed description of the product the company proposes to develop. Technical descriptions are used before products and processes are developed (as part of proposals and planning documents), during development (in progress reports, for instance), and afterwards (as part of marketing and promotional literature and technical support documents). You will write a technical definition for an object, concept, or process in your field.

Instruction Set: Instruction sets are common technical documents for many disciplines and occupations. Employees read instructions to learn how to assemble a product or complete a procedure. Supervisors write out company policies that oftentimes serve as instruction sets. Customers read instructions for using a product. You will develop a set of instructions advising users to perform a specific task.        

E-Portfolio: Electronic portfolios are an increasingly common vehicle for developing a professional online identity. Professionals are beginning to create them and employers are beginning to expect them. Employers are interested in e-portfolios for a variety of reasons: they provide multiple writing samples, display skills with computers and new media, and require reflection and meta-knowledge. Professionals like e-portfolios because they help them keep track of their projects and accomplishments. As a final course assignment, you will design an e-portfolio using the Penn State WordPress environment. The portfolio will include work from this course and from others. You will create your e-portfolio for an audience of potential employers.

Reading Quizzes
You will complete ten in-class, unannounced reading quizzes on Canvas throughout the semester. If you must be absent on a quiz day, you can make up the quiz by submitting it on Canvas within 7 days from the date/time that the quiz was assigned. Canvas will automatically drop your lowest quiz result (i.e., only your nine best quiz results will count towards your grade).

Class Participation
Your participation is integral to the success of this course. You will help your fellow writers, and you will make the class that much more engaging and stimulating for both of us (I don’t want to hear me talk for 75 minutes non-stop, and I assume you don’t either). Ask questions. Voice your observations. Listen to and respond to your fellow classmates. If you are uncomfortable participating during class, bring your questions and observations to me during Office Hours. I will take this into account when considering your participation grade.

Note that use of personal technology like smartphones and headphones during class is prohibited, and may affect your participation grade. Laptops and tablets are permitted, but as with using the lab computers, you are expected to work only on material that we are working on in class that day. Doing otherwise (e.g. using personal e-mail, social network sites, or working on material for other classes) may affect your participation grade.

At the mid-point of the semester, you will receive a participation grade that counts for 0 points. This will provide a status update on how you are doing, and incentivize you to either increase your participation, or continue the good work that you’re doing.

As a guideline, here is a rubric for participation grades.

A: Participates or offers to participate multiple times per class. Insightful comments using terms and concepts from the readings and other classes. Very attentive and engaged in the particulars of the class discussion. Makes substantial contributions in group activities.

Often uses computers for tasks unrelated to the class meeting. Speaks while others are talking. Nods off during class. Does not participate in group activities.
F: Refuses to participate. Disrupts class or is disrespectful of other classmates. Frequently sleeps during class. Disrupts group activities. Excessive absences from class.

Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

Do not risk failing this course due to a short-sighted lapse in judgment.

ACCESSIBILITY: DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Student Disability Resources Web site provides contact information for every Penn State campus. For further information, please visit the Student Disability Resources website.

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation . If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

EDUCATION EQUITY: BIAS REPORTING
Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated and can be reported through Educational Equity via the Report Bias webpage 

COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.

STANDARDS OF CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR 
Classroom behavior should always reflect the essential Penn State values of civility, integrity, and respect for the dignity and rights of others. As such, the classroom space should be safe, orderly, and positive—free from disruptions, disorderly conduct, and harassment as defined in the University Code of Conduct . The University Code of Conduct defines disruption “as an action or combination of actions by one or more individuals that unreasonably interferes with, hinders, obstructs, or prevents the operation of the University or infringes on the rights of others to freely participate in its programs and services;” disorderly conduct includes but is not limited to “creating unreasonable noise; pushing and shoving; creating a physically hazardous or physically offensive condition;” and harassment may include “directing physical or verbal conduct at an individual…; subjecting a person or group of persons to unwanted physical contact or threat of such; or engaging in a course of conduct, including following the person without proper authority (e.g., stalking), under circumstances which would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or to suffer emotional distress” (Section IV, B). The course instructor has the authority to request that any disruptive students leave the class for the class period. If disruptive behavior continues in subsequent class periods, a complaint may be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which may result in the student being dismissed from class until University procedures have been completed. Any student with concerns or questions as to this policy should contact the Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric.

Course Description and Course Goals
This course provides an introduction to the scientific study of politics and its role in advancing
our understanding of politics. The course covers essential elements of scientific reasoning,
introduces systematic approaches to research in political science through the use of major
puzzles in the field, and introduces data sources and interpretation of graphical and tabular data.
The course consists of three parts. The first part covers the elements of scientific reasoning,
including: characteristics of scientific knowledge, theory and hypotheses, the concepts of
dependent and independent variables, and causal explanations. The second part of the course
examines dominant approaches to political research, including: experiments, surveys, elite
interviewing, archival research, the analysis of “big data”, and formal models. This course
introduces the essential features and concepts underlying each approach, identifies exemplary
data sources and puzzles that have been addressed with each approach, and the strengths and
weaknesses of each approach. Along the way we will interpret basic tabular and graphical
analysis. The final part of the course, during the last week of classes, pulls together the course
material, emphasizing some of the benefits of scientific approaches to researching politics.
At the end of the course you should be able to:
• Describe the steps in the scientific process.
• Identify the theory, central hypothesis, and independent and dependent variables in a
research project.
• Explain the essential features of and concepts in the main approaches to the scientific
study of politics and provide an example of each: experiments, survey analysis, elite
interviews, archival research, analysis of Big Data, and formal models.
• Interpret tabular displays of data and graphical presentations of data.
Students will not learn how to do statistical analysis in this class.
Course Format
This course will be a mixture of lectures, discussions, and exercises.
Laptops
We will be doing regular in-class exercises to demonstrate and experiment with the different
scientific approaches to studying politics. You will need to have a laptop in class during these
working sessions. For this reason, I ask that you bring a laptop to class. However, laptops are to
remain closed when we are not using them for in-class exercises.
For information on borrowing a laptop from the library visit the following website:
https://libraries.psu.edu/services/computers-and-technology/borrow-computers-and-technologyequipment/borrow-laptop
Readings
There is no required text that must be purchased. All readings are available for download on
Canvas or on links provided on the syllabus, and when you do not see them in either of those
places, it means the reading is available for download or as an e-book through the Penn State
Libraries website (so always make sure to search for readings there).
Course Evaluation
1. Exercises (25%)
Over the course of the semester we will be doing a number of exercises (sometimes inclass and other times at home). I will drop the assignment with the lowest grade.
Assignment grades will be docked 10 points for each day late. There will be no make-up
opportunities for missed in-class assignments. (There will be no penalties for missed
assignment due to documented university excused absences.)
2. Midterm (20%)
The midterm will include definitions and short answer question as well as a longer essay
question structured similarly to the exercises that you will complete as homework
assignments. The midterm will be held in the testing center on February 22.
3. Final Paper (20%)
You will write a final paper (5-6 pages) in which you pick a question about politics that
interests you and describe how two of the approaches that we learn about during the
course of the class could be used to address it. A detailed description of the paper will be
available within the first few weeks of class. There are 3 due dates associated with the
final paper. Part 1 of the paper project is due by Friday, March 2nd at 6PM on Canvas. Part
2 of the paper project is due by Friday, March 23rd at 6PM on Canvas. The final version of
the paper project is due by Friday, April 20th at 6PM on Canvas. Details about the final
paper assignment will be available on Canvas within a few weeks of the beginning of the
semester.
4. Final Exam (25%)
There will be a cumulative final exam during finals week in the testing center.
5. Participation (10%)
I will not be taking attendance during class. Your participation grades will be based on
your completion of unannounced in-class assignments and quizzes. There will be no
make-up opportunities for these in-class assignments and quizzes. However, I will drop
your two lowest scores throughout the semester. (There will be no penalties for missed
assignment due to documented university excused absences.)
Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner.
Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania
State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance
with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that
all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and
property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the
fruits of their efforts.
Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to
engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty
violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the
worth of work completed by others.
Accommodations
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Every
Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. Student Disability Resources
(SDR) website provides contact information for every Penn State campus
(http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator). For further information, please visit the Student
Disability Resources website (http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/).
In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the
appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate
in an intake interview, and provide documentation: See documentation guidelines at
(http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable
accommodations, your campus disability services office will provide you with an
accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the
accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester
that you request accommodations.
Counseling and Psychological Services
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may
interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The
university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including
individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental 
health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a
philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences
in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.

Penn State Crisis Line (24 hours/7 days/week): 877-229-6400
Crisis Text Line (24 hours/7 days/week): Text LIONS to 741741
Educational Equity
Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty,
and staff. Consistent with University Policy AD29, students who believe they have experienced
or observed a hate crime, an act of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment that occurs at Penn
State are urged to report these incidents as outlined on the University’s Report Bias webpage
(http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/)

with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that
all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and
property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the
fruits of their efforts.
Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to
engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty
violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the
worth of work completed by others.

accommodations, your campus disability services office will provide you with an
accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the
accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester
that you request accommodations.
Counseling and Psychological Services
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may
interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The
university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including
individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental 
health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a
philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences

Course Description and Course Goals
This course provides an introduction to the scientific study of politics and its role in advancing
our understanding of politics. The course covers essential elements of scientific reasoning,
introduces systematic approaches to research in political science through the use of major
puzzles in the field, and introduces data sources and interpretation of graphical and tabular data.
The course consists of three parts. The first part covers the elements of scientific reasoning,
including: characteristics of scientific knowledge, theory and hypotheses, the concepts of
dependent and independent variables, and causal explanations. The second part of the course
examines dominant approaches to political research, including: experiments, surveys, elite
interviewing, archival research, the analysis of “big data”, and formal models. This course
introduces the essential features and concepts underlying each approach, identifies exemplary
data sources and puzzles that have been addressed with each approach, and the strengths and
weaknesses of each approach. Along the way we will interpret basic tabular and graphical
analysis. The final part of the course, during the last week of classes, pulls together the course
material, emphasizing some of the benefits of scientific approaches to researching politics.
At the end of the course you should be able to:
• Describe the steps in the scientific process.
• Identify the theory, central hypothesis, and independent and dependent variables in a
research project.
• Explain the essential features of and concepts in the main approaches to the scientific
study of politics and provide an example of each: experiments, survey analysis, elite
interviews, archival research, analysis of Big Data, and formal models.
• Interpret tabular displays of data and graphical presentations of data.
Students will not learn how to do statistical analysis in this class.
Course Format
This course will be a mixture of lectures, discussions, and exercises.
Laptops
We will be doing regular in-class exercises to demonstrate and experiment with the different
scientific approaches to studying politics. You will need to have a laptop in class during these
working sessions. For this reason, I ask that you bring a laptop to class. However, laptops are to
remain closed when we are not using them for in-class exercises.

Readings
There is no required text that must be purchased. All readings are available for download on
Canvas or on links provided on the syllabus, and when you do not see them in either of those
places, it means the reading is available for download or as an e-book through the Penn State
Libraries website (so always make sure to search for readings there).
Course Evaluation
1. Exercises (25%)
Over the course of the semester we will be doing a number of exercises (sometimes inclass and other times at home). I will drop the assignment with the lowest grade.
Assignment grades will be docked 10 points for each day late. There will be no make-up
opportunities for missed in-class assignments. (There will be no penalties for missed
assignment due to documented university excused absences.)
2. Midterm (20%)
The midterm will include definitions and short answer question as well as a longer essay
question structured similarly to the exercises that you will complete as homework
assignments. The midterm will be held in the testing center on February 22.
3. Final Paper (20%)
You will write a final paper (5-6 pages) in which you pick a question about politics that
interests you and describe how two of the approaches that we learn about during the
course of the class could be used to address it. A detailed description of the paper will be
available within the first few weeks of class. There are 3 due dates associated with the
final paper. Part 1 of the paper project is due by Friday, March 2nd at 6PM on Canvas. Part
2 of the paper project is due by Friday, March 23rd at 6PM on Canvas. The final version of
the paper project is due by Friday, April 20th at 6PM on Canvas. Details about the final
paper assignment will be available on Canvas within a few weeks of the beginning of the
semester.
4. Final Exam (25%)
There will be a cumulative final exam during finals week in the testing center.
5. Participation (10%)
I will not be taking attendance during class. Your participation grades will be based on
your completion of unannounced in-class assignments and quizzes. There will be no
make-up opportunities for these in-class assignments and quizzes. However, I will drop
your two lowest scores throughout the semester. (There will be no penalties for missed
assignment due to documented university excused absences.)

COURSE OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES
This course explores the use of accounting information for internal planning, analysis, and
decision‐making. The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to
understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non‐financial reports used in
managing modern firms.
Managing any modern firm requires information about the firm’s products, processes, assets,
and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of decisions: analyzing
profitability of various products, managing product‐line portfolios, setting prices, measuring
and managing profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating
investments, guiding improvement efforts, and so on.
The focus of this course is on modern internal‐reporting systems. We will discover that many
firms do not provide their managers with useful information; we will see numerous examples of
value destruction and bankruptcies caused by this. We will also investigate some modern ideas
in how an organization’s internal information system should be designed to enhance value
creation; and we will see how world‐class firms take advantage of their competitors’ internal‐ 
reporting mistakes.
To attain the right level of understanding, we will briefly explore the mechanics of the many
techniques used to prepare internal reports. But the emphasis in this course is very much on
interpretation, evaluation, and decision‐making.

TEACHING MATERIALS
Required textbook:
 What Counts & What Gets Counted (click the link to download), by Robert Bloomfield.   
 This eBook is free and is designed for electronic use, with links from the table of contents to
each chapter, from terms in the essays to the glossary at the end (and back), and from
references to internet content.
 The book includes links to over 100 videos. The eCornell videos provide mini‐presentations
on both qualitative and quantitative topics, often with helpful animations. The Accounting
with Our Bare Hands videos walk through problems illustrating the mechanics of cost
accounting. If you are able to answer quiz questions and participate in discussions
effectively, you don't need to watch the videos.  Alternatively, you can watch the videos
instead of reading the book.  But most people find it helpful to spend some time with both
text and video.
Recommended textbook:
 Managerial Accounting, by Garrison, Noreen, and Brewer, 17thedition.  
 You can also use the much less expensive 16th edition of the Garrison‐Noreen‐Brewer text.  
 Roughly half the course sessions will rely on pre‐readings from this text. Also, for most
course topics, I will suggest several problems from the text for self‐study and self‐
evaluation.
Cases:
Some of the cases we will use are copyrighted cases. You will need to purchase these cases
from Harvard Business School Publishing; instructions will be posted on NYU Brightspace.
I will post reading materials not requiring copyrights and lecture slides on NYU Brightspace.  
I will also post any important announcements on NYU Brightspace.
FEEDBACK
I encourage you to provide feedback on class topics, content, and cases. I appreciate any
concerns, questions, or opinions regarding the course. I would like to continue to improve this
course; participants’ feedback is critical.
3
CLASS MEETINGS
In each class, we focus on the management aspects of the topic. To prepare for class, youshould
go through the readings and prepare case questions (for classes where we discuss cases).
Case discussion will take up approximately half of the course. I have found that a mix oflectures,
cases, and discussions provides an ideal interactive learning environment.
Students will be active participants in case discussions, providing summaries of issues,analyses,
and recommendations. This involves the preparation of the case and reading assignments
before class and the active sharing of your insights during class.
Note that many of the managerial problems I will address through cases will not have clear‐ cut
or “correct” solutions; do not let this discourage you.
Each student should carefully prepare the assigned case and be ready to be called on to present
their analysis or to comment on others' analyses. You are encouraged to prepare forcases in
teams. I will randomly call on students when discussing cases.
GRADES   
The course grade will be based on class participation, one closed‐book midterm, 2
case write‐ ups, and a closed‐book final examination:
Grades will be based on the following weights:
Alt. 1 Alt. 2
Attendance (ON TIME) and Participation    10% 10%
Quizzes and Assignments 10% 10%
Submitting of short answers in preparation to cases (effort grade) 10% 10%
Write‐up of Roomrunner Security Solutions and Falco scooter (A) 10% 10%
Midterm Exam 25% 15%
Final Exam 35% 45%
Total 100% 100%
Class participation. The grade for class participation will depend on the quality of your
interaction and participation in class discussions. The following factors will be considered:
 Case preparation. You should prepare answers to the case questions. I encourage you to
prepare for cases in small groups. I will randomly call on students to contribute to case
discussion.
 Contributing to the in‐class case analysis by making comments to move the discussiontoward
an understanding of the company and its issues.
4
Write‐up of Roomrunner Security Solutions and Falco Scooters (A) cases. Thess write‐ups will be
graded based on effort only. Submit the assignment on NYU Brightspace.
Midterm. We will have one in‐class, closed‐book midterm.
Final exam. The final exam will be in‐class and closed‐book. You may use a single page of notes
(front and back). The final exam is not cumulative, but the material in the second half of the
course builds on the knowledge acquired in the first half, before the midterm.
Please note the following grading‐related policies:
 There will be no make‐up midterm examinations under any circumstances. If you miss the
midterm because of a medical or family emergency, you will need to provide me with
documentation; in this case, the weight of the midterm will be added to the weightof the
final.
 The weights, in “Grading” above, are identical for everyone. It is not possible to makeup for
poor performance by doing extra work.
 Request for re‐grading exams must be made within 7 days of the score posting. To have an
exam re‐graded, you must submit a short written description of your argument that
explains the grading mistake and why you believe you deserve additional credit. Upon
receipt of your written description, I will review the entire exam for grading accuracy;
therefore, your grade may go up or down as a result of the re‐grade request.
CELL PHONES, TABLETS AND LAPTOP COMPUTERS – NO ELECTRONIC POLICY  
Experience and research have shown that use of electronic devices during class significantly
disrupts learning, both for the students using the device and for others in the class.
Cell phones should be turned off and put away during class.  TEXTING DURING CLASS IS NOT
PERMITTED.
No tablets or laptop computers are allowed. I realized that some students prefer to take class
notes on their tablet/computer, however, in many cases this causes more distractions than
benefits, to the user and students around. If you really have to use your laptop/tablet, please
contact me.

each chapter, from terms in the essays to the glossary at the end (and back), and from
references to internet content.
 The book includes links to over 100 videos. The eCornell videos provide mini‐presentations
on both qualitative and quantitative topics, often with helpful animations. The Accounting
with Our Bare Hands videos walk through problems illustrating the mechanics of cost
accounting. If you are able to answer quiz questions and participate in discussions
effectively, you don't need to watch the videos.  Alternatively, you can watch the videos
instead of reading the book.  But most people find it helpful to spend some time with both
text and video.
Recommended textbook:
 Managerial Accounting.  
 You can also use the much less expensive 16th edition of the text.  
 Roughly half the course sessions will rely on pre‐readings from this text. Also, for most
course topics, I will suggest several problems from the text for self‐study and self‐
evaluation.
Cases:
Some of the cases we will use are copyrighted cases. You will need to purchase these cases
from Harvard Business School Publishing; instructions will be posted on NYU Brightspace.
I will post reading materials not requiring copyrights and lecture slides on NYU Brightspace.  
I will also post any important announcements on NYU Brightspace.
FEEDBACK
I encourage you to provide feedback on class topics, content, and cases. I appreciate any
concerns, questions, or opinions regarding the course. I would like to continue to improve this
course; participants’ feedback is critical.
3
CLASS MEETINGS
In each class, we focus on the management aspects of the topic. To prepare for class, youshould
go through the readings and prepare case questions (for classes where we discuss cases).
Case discussion will take up approximately half of the course. I have found that a mix oflectures,
cases, and discussions provides an ideal interactive learning environment.
Students will be active participants in case discussions, providing summaries of issues,analyses,
and recommendations. This involves the preparation of the case and reading assignments
before class and the active sharing of your insights during class.
Note that many of the managerial problems I will address through cases will not have clear‐ cut
or “correct” solutions; do not let this discourage you.
Each student should carefully prepare the assigned case and be ready to be called on to present
their analysis or to comment on others' analyses. You are encouraged to prepare forcases in
teams. I will randomly call on students when discussing cases.
GRADES   
The course grade will be based on class participation, one closed‐book midterm, 2
case write‐ ups, and a closed‐book final examination:
Grades will be based on the following weights:
Alt. 1 Alt. 2
Attendance (ON TIME) and Participation    10% 10%
Quizzes and Assignments 10% 10%
Submitting of short answers in preparation to cases (effort grade) 10% 10%
Write‐up of Roomrunner Security Solutions and Falco scooter (A) 10% 10%
Midterm Exam 25% 15%
Final Exam 35% 45%
Total 100% 100%
Class participation. The grade for class participation will depend on the quality of your
interaction and participation in class discussions. The following factors will be considered:
 Case preparation. You should prepare answers to the case questions. I encourage you to
prepare for cases in small groups. I will randomly call on students to contribute to case
discussion.
 Contributing to the in‐class case analysis by making comments to move the discussiontoward
an understanding of the company and its issues.
4
Write‐up of Roomrunner Security Solutions and Falco Scooters (A) cases. Thess write‐ups will be
graded based on effort only. Submit the assignment on NYU Brightspace.
Midterm. We will have one in‐class, closed‐book midterm.
Final exam. The final exam will be in‐class and closed‐book. You may use a single page of notes
(front and back). The final exam is not cumulative, but the material in the second half of the
course builds on the knowledge acquired in the first half, before the midterm.
Please note the following grading‐related policies:
 There will be no make‐up midterm examinations under any circumstances. If you miss the
midterm because of a medical or family emergency, you will need to provide me with
documentation; in this case, the weight of the midterm will be added to the weightof the
final.
 The weights, in “Grading” above, are identical for everyone. It is not possible to makeup for
poor performance by doing extra work.
 Request for re‐grading exams must be made within 7 days of the score posting. To have an
exam re‐graded, you must submit a short written description of your argument that
explains the grading mistake and why you believe you deserve additional credit. Upon
receipt of your written description, I will review the entire exam for grading accuracy;
therefore, your grade may go up or down as a result of the re‐grade request.
CELL PHONES, TABLETS AND LAPTOP COMPUTERS – NO ELECTRONIC POLICY  
Experience and research have shown that use of electronic devices during class significantly
disrupts learning, both for the students using the device and for others in the class.
Cell phones should be turned off and put away during class.  TEXTING DURING CLASS IS NOT
PERMITTED.
No tablets or laptop computers are allowed. I realized that some students prefer to take class
notes on their tablet/computer, however, in many cases this causes more distractions than
benefits, to the user and students around. If you really have to use your laptop/tablet, please
contact me.

the Stern standards of academic excellence. To ensure fairness and clarity of grading, the Stern
faculty have adopted a grading guideline for core courses with enrollments of more than 25
students in which approximately 35% of students will receive an “A” or “A‐“ grade. In core
classes of less than 25 students, the instructor is at liberty to give whatever grades they think
the students deserve, while maintaining rigorous academic standards.
Grading Information for Stern Elective Courses
At NYU Stern, we strive to create courses that challenge students intellectually and that meet
the Stern standards of academic excellence. To ensure fairness and clarity of grading, the Stern
faculty have agreed that for elective courses the individual instructor or department is
responsible for determining reasonable grading guidelines.

WRITING/REPORT WKSHP II BUSINESS
& ECONOMIC REPORTING (Online)
Spring 2021
Professor: Penenberg, Adam
Monday, 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM
Course Description
This writing course focuses on the various components and approaches to
in-depth feature stories. We’ll dissect great modern and classic works of
journalism for story, character, dialogue, scenes, structure, transitions, verb
tense, point of view, style and impact. The goal is to create memorable nonfiction stories that hold a reader’s attention to the last word.
This is a challenging course with a heavy reading load and a high bar for
writing assignments, befitting graduate journalism students at New York
University. The emphasis is on learning by doing, with regular reporting and
writing assignments inside and outside of class. These include a profile, firstperson story, in-class writing exercises, a case study involving an in-depth
interview with a working journalist, and at the end of the semester a 2,000-
word feature story that displays dogged reporting and strong, evocative
writing. Along the way we’ll work on your pitches, discuss your research,
share interview techniques, as well as address techniques for time
management, creating strong outlines and multiple drafts, improve your
editing and, confront other professional challenges.
Over the course of the semester I will meet with each of you individually to
discuss your work and progress, and to find out how I can help you achieve
your dreams in journalism whatever they might be. 
2
Learning Objectives
In this course, students will:
• Demonstrate awareness of journalism’s core ethical values
• Write clear, accurate and engaging prose in anaudienceappropriate manner
• Engage in critical thinking, independence, and creativity
appropriate to the role of journalism in a democraticsociety
• Interview subjects, conduct research, and evaluate information
• Work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness, anddiverse
perspectives
• Experience launching and operating a new website
• Read some of the finest feature writing from the past and the
present
• Explore the art and craft of feature writing through various realworld assignments
• Learn about structure, character development, point of view,
attribution, ethics, and other aspects of good journalisticwriting
• Improve grammar, punctuation, structure, and the like
Course Structure
This is a writing workshop with lectures, ample discussions and
workshopping, as well as pitch sessions and student presentations.
Sometimes we’ll do writing exercises in class. Beforehand there is usually
required reading.
In class over Zoom I will explain how to take apart long-form stories for
content: the lede, nut graf (if applicable), use of quotes and/or dialogue,
character arcs, pacing, point of view, etc., which are integral to writing good
long-form features. We’ll critique great and perhaps not-so-great feature
stories and other media. Sometimes we’ll break into small groups to engage in
peer editing, discussions, or complete writing exercises. I’ll also lecture on
topics relevant to journalists working today, as well as on the various ethical,
legal and cultural aspects of journalism.
Required Reading
3
There is no textbook for this class. Instead, I will regularly assign articles,
research studies, and other relevant material, including a series of modules
that covers grammar and punctuation, AP Style, fact-checking, digital
verification, and the NYU Journalism Handbook. Some come with graded
knowledge checks to test your comprehension and mastery of the material. I
have also created a significant amount of my own material that covers the
craft of journalism (reporting, interviews, writing), the history of journalism,
media law and other topics.
Writing Assignments
Over the course of the semester, you will have four major written
assignments:
Profile (1200 words): An in-depth profile of a person (not a company or
organization) doing something important, whether heading an intriguing
startup or running for political office. You must have a minimum of three
additional quoted sources in your story, people who can shed light on your
profile subject.
First-person story 1,000 words): An article written in the first person that
features you doing something interesting. In the past a student went to a gun
range to write about his experience firing an assault weapon. Another student
went to a ‘rage room’ to smash things. A third worked at a soup kitchen. In
general, the more interesting the experience, the better the story.
Journalism case study (1200 words): Interview a journalist about a
magazine feature story you admire and deconstruct each step the writer took
– from the initial idea, interviews, research and reporting, the editing process
to final publication and the impact the article had. I will provide samples of
successful journalism case studies I’ve received over the years on which you
can base yours.
Feature story (2000 words): A magazine feature story that exhibits deep
research and multiple interviews, and which brings together everything you
learned over the course of the semester. You’ll complete two drafts. After the
first draft I’ll assign you a professional features editor or writer to give you
extensive feedback for your second draft.

Course Requirements
Students are expected to read and/or view all assigned materials in advance
of class. If you miss class, there is no excuse for not getting in touch with me in
advance. For any excused absence – in the event of a serious illness, death in

the family, or an approved athletic event, for example – I may ask you to
submit documentation. (In the event of a religious holiday, there is no need of
documentation. Just alert me in advance.)
If you have two unexcused absences, you can lose a half point off your final
grade (“B+” lowered to “B,” and so on.) Three unexcused absences could result
in a full point off. If you skip more than three classes, you could fail.
You must log in to class on time. If you are late to more than one class zoom
session, your grade could be affected. Don’t ask if you can miss class or
come late because you have scheduled an interview with a source who
claims she can only make that time.
Class participation is essential. Students must be prepared to present their
assignments in class, participate in group discussions and workshops and
work in teams. Everyone is expected to participate. This also goes for
discussions involving each week’s reading. I will call on students to talk about
various aspects of each article, so be prepared. That means reading carefully
all of the assigned work in advance of class. To be a good writer you have to
read. A lot. And be able to dissect others’ work.
This is an online course and we meets once a week over Zoom. Try to stay
focused in class. While it may be tempting to surf the Web and shop for shoes
an Amazon or check Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram while we are meeting,
please stay focused. You must have our video camera turned on for the
duration of class.
Twitter
Twitter has become the de facto platform for journalists. It’s not only an
excellent way to market your work; it’s also a useful media filter. The higher
the caliber of people you follow, the higher the quality of the information you
can process. It’s not about tweeting about what you had for lunch, your cat’s
latest trick or why you are so fond of chocolate cupcakes. It’s what my
colleague Prof. Jay Rosen calls “mindcasting.” Sign up for Twitter (if you
already haven’t) and “follow” selected journalists, media critics, and thinkers
relevant to business, technology, the media industry and your chosen blog
beat. Stay focused; don’t stray. An easy way to amass people to follow is to
search for reporters, editors, and businesspeople on your beat and select from 
6
their list of followers. You should tweet every day, multiple times, if possible.
That’s the only way for you to attract a following and introduce yourself to the
community of journalists. My Twitter handle is @penenberg.
Grading
Final grades calculated as follows:
1. Profile (1,200 words) = 20% of your final grade
2. First-person story: 1,000-word article featuring you = 20%
3. Journalist case study (1,200 words). Interview a working
journalist about a favorite narrative story and write a casestudy =
10%
4. Final feature story (2,000+ words, 2 drafts). Final draft due at the
beginning of the final class. You must file each draft of your story
on deadline. Handing in your first draft late could result in a full
grade off your final story (A becomes a B, B a C, and so on.) = 30%
5. Interactive modules = 10%
6. Class participation & in-class writing assignments = 10%
File your assignments in Microsoft Word or send me a link to your story in
Google Docs (be sure to give me editing privileges). Label your file with your
name (last name.first name) and the date (day, month, year). Like this:
Harris.Kamala.4July2021.docx or equivalent.
Rewrites (i.e. second drafts) are optional. If you choose to rewrite an
assignment, I will replace the original grade with what I assume will be a
significantly higher one.
Accommodations
Students with disabilities that necessitate accommodations should contact
and register with New York University’s Moses Center for Students with
Disabilities (CSD) at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu. Information about
the Moses Center can be found at www.nyu.edu/csd. The Moses Center is
located at 726 Broadway on the 2nd floor.
Diversity & Inclusion
7
The Institute is committed to creating an inclusive learning environment. The
Institute embraces a notion of intellectual community enriched and enhanced
by diversity along a number of dimensions.
A Word on Trigger Warnings
Over the past few years a heated debate has raged in academia (if you can say
anything rages in academia) over the use of “trigger warnings.” One common
definition of a trigger warning is “a statement at the start of a piece of writing,
video, etc., alerting the reader or viewer to the fact that it contains potentially
distressing material (often used tointroduce a description of such content).”
Trigger warning proponents point out that some students in any given class
may have suffered some level of trauma, whether it arises from sexual assault,
violence, or other types of abuse. They should therefore receive fair warning
when a reading or discussion relates to material that could cause them
discomfort.
Trigger warning critics contend that the world is often messy, disturbing, and
violent, and that a master’s program in journalism is a time for intellectual
growth and emotional development. For this to occur, a professor’s role is to
challenge students so they learn to engage rationally with arguments, ideas,
opinions, and principles they might find upsetting or even deeply offensive.
While NYU does not subscribe to any university-wide position on trigger
warnings – the administration advises anyone who might be traumatized by a
reading or video to seek appropriate help at the university’s health center –
the journalism faculty believes our entire profession should come stamped
with a giant trigger warning. Part of what we do as journalists is to seek the
truth no matter where it may lead. This can sometimes take us into violent,
disturbing places.
In this course we will read and discuss articles and view videothat can at
times deal with disturbing themes, which include sexual assault, violence, war
and combat, terrorism, disease, racism and sexism.
If these are topics you believe could trigger in you any psychologicalor health
problems, you should not take this course.
8
At times you may find yourself vehemently disagreeing with the writer of an
essay, article, feature story, interview subject on camera, another student, a
guest, or even your professor. I encourage you to speak up and share your
perspectives. But do it in a way that fosters mutual respect. Be aware that
reasonable people can sometimes hold views that may appear “extreme” to
some.
The Syllabus
A syllabus is simply a guidepost for the semester. While I’ll try to stick to this
schedule we may skip around if the natural flow of the lessons dictate. No
class is the same; if you have additional ideas for topics we should cover, I'm
all ears. Sometimes links to articles can disappear or change. If so, let me
know and I’ll find alternative sources. I expect you to read the assigned
material but that doesn’t mean we’ll always have time to discuss everything in
class. Nevertheless, these are high quality stories well worth the effort. By
analyzing them you will be further on yourway to becoming a better writer.

& ECONOMIC REPORTING (Online)
Spring 2021
Course Description
This writing course focuses on the various components and approaches to
in-depth feature stories. We’ll dissect great modern and classic works of
journalism for story, character, dialogue, scenes, structure, transitions, verb
tense, point of view, style and impact. The goal is to create memorable nonfiction stories that hold a reader’s attention to the last word.
This is a challenging course with a heavy reading load and a high bar for
writing assignments, befitting graduate journalism students at New York
University. The emphasis is on learning by doing, with regular reporting and
writing assignments inside and outside of class. These include a profile, firstperson story, in-class writing exercises, a case study involving an in-depth
interview with a working journalist, and at the end of the semester a 2,000-
word feature story that displays dogged reporting and strong, evocative
writing. Along the way we’ll work on your pitches, discuss your research,
share interview techniques, as well as address techniques for time
management, creating strong outlines and multiple drafts, improve your
editing and, confront other professional challenges.
Over the course of the semester I will meet with each of you individually to
discuss your work and progress, and to find out how I can help you achieve
your dreams in journalism whatever they might be. 
2
Learning Objectives
In this course, students will:
• Demonstrate awareness of journalism’s core ethical values
• Write clear, accurate and engaging prose in anaudienceappropriate manner
• Engage in critical thinking, independence, and creativity
appropriate to the role of journalism in a democraticsociety
• Interview subjects, conduct research, and evaluate information
• Work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness, anddiverse
perspectives
• Experience launching and operating a new website
• Read some of the finest feature writing from the past and the
present
• Explore the art and craft of feature writing through various realworld assignments
• Learn about structure, character development, point of view,
attribution, ethics, and other aspects of good journalisticwriting
• Improve grammar, punctuation, structure, and the like
Course Structure
This is a writing workshop with lectures, ample discussions and
workshopping, as well as pitch sessions and student presentations.
Sometimes we’ll do writing exercises in class. Beforehand there is usually
required reading.
In class over Zoom I will explain how to take apart long-form stories for
content: the lede, nut graf (if applicable), use of quotes and/or dialogue,
character arcs, pacing, point of view, etc., which are integral to writing good
long-form features. We’ll critique great and perhaps not-so-great feature
stories and other media. Sometimes we’ll break into small groups to engage in
peer editing, discussions, or complete writing exercises. I’ll also lecture on
topics relevant to journalists working today, as well as on the various ethical,
legal and cultural aspects of journalism.
Required Reading
3
There is no textbook for this class. Instead, I will regularly assign articles,
research studies, and other relevant material, including a series of modules
that covers grammar and punctuation, AP Style, fact-checking, digital
verification, and the NYU Journalism Handbook. Some come with graded
knowledge checks to test your comprehension and mastery of the material. I
have also created a significant amount of my own material that covers the
craft of journalism (reporting, interviews, writing), the history of journalism,
media law and other topics.
Writing Assignments
Over the course of the semester, you will have four major written
assignments:
Profile (1200 words): An in-depth profile of a person (not a company or
organization) doing something important, whether heading an intriguing
startup or running for political office. You must have a minimum of three
additional quoted sources in your story, people who can shed light on your
profile subject.
First-person story 1,000 words): An article written in the first person that
features you doing something interesting. In the past a student went to a gun
range to write about his experience firing an assault weapon. Another student
went to a ‘rage room’ to smash things. A third worked at a soup kitchen. In
general, the more interesting the experience, the better the story.
Journalism case study (1200 words): Interview a journalist about a
magazine feature story you admire and deconstruct each step the writer took
– from the initial idea, interviews, research and reporting, the editing process
to final publication and the impact the article had. I will provide samples of
successful journalism case studies I’ve received over the years on which you
can base yours.
Feature story (2000 words): A magazine feature story that exhibits deep
research and multiple interviews, and which brings together everything you
learned over the course of the semester. You’ll complete two drafts. After the
first draft I’ll assign you a professional features editor or writer to give you
extensive feedback for your second draft.

Course Requirements
Students are expected to read and/or view all assigned materials in advance
of class. If you miss class, there is no excuse for not getting in touch with me in
advance. For any excused absence – in the event of a serious illness, death in 
5
the family, or an approved athletic event, for example – I may ask you to
submit documentation. (In the event of a religious holiday, there is no need of
documentation. Just alert me in advance.)
If you have two unexcused absences, you can lose a half point off your final
grade (“B+” lowered to “B,” and so on.) Three unexcused absences could result
in a full point off. If you skip more than three classes, you could fail.
You must log in to class on time. If you are late to more than one class zoom
session, your grade could be affected. Don’t ask if you can miss class or
come late because you have scheduled an interview with a source who
claims she can only make that time.
Class participation is essential. Students must be prepared to present their
assignments in class, participate in group discussions and workshops and
work in teams. Everyone is expected to participate. This also goes for
discussions involving each week’s reading. I will call on students to talk about
various aspects of each article, so be prepared. That means reading carefully
all of the assigned work in advance of class. To be a good writer you have to
read. A lot. And be able to dissect others’ work.
This is an online course and we meets once a week over Zoom. Try to stay
focused in class. While it may be tempting to surf the Web and shop for shoes
an Amazon or check Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram while we are meeting,
please stay focused. You must have our video camera turned on for the
duration of class.
Twitter
Twitter has become the de facto platform for journalists. It’s not only an
excellent way to market your work; it’s also a useful media filter. The higher
the caliber of people you follow, the higher the quality of the information you
can process. It’s not about tweeting about what you had for lunch, your cat’s
latest trick or why you are so fond of chocolate cupcakes. It’s what my
colleague Prof. Jay Rosen calls “mindcasting.” Sign up for Twitter (if you
already haven’t) and “follow” selected journalists, media critics, and thinkers
relevant to business, technology, the media industry and your chosen blog
beat. Stay focused; don’t stray. An easy way to amass people to follow is to
search for reporters, editors, and businesspeople on your beat and select from 
6
their list of followers. You should tweet every day, multiple times, if possible.
That’s the only way for you to attract a following and introduce yourself to the
community of journalists. My Twitter handle is @penenberg.
Grading
Final grades calculated as follows:
1. Profile (1,200 words) = 20% of your final grade
2. First-person story: 1,000-word article featuring you = 20%
3. Journalist case study (1,200 words). Interview a working
journalist about a favorite narrative story and write a casestudy =
10%
4. Final feature story (2,000+ words, 2 drafts). Final draft due at the
beginning of the final class. You must file each draft of your story
on deadline. Handing in your first draft late could result in a full
grade off your final story (A becomes a B, B a C, and so on.) = 30%
5. Interactive modules = 10%
6. Class participation & in-class writing assignments = 10%
File your assignments in Microsoft Word or send me a link to your story in
Google Docs (be sure to give me editing privileges). Label your file with your
name (last name.first name) and the date (day, month, year). Like this:
Harris.Kamala.4July2021.docx or equivalent.
Rewrites (i.e. second drafts) are optional. If you choose to rewrite an
assignment, I will replace the original grade with what I assume will be a
significantly higher one.
Accommodations
Students with disabilities that necessitate accommodations should contact
and register with New York University’s Moses Center for Students with
Disabilities (CSD) at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu. Information about
the Moses Center can be found at www.nyu.edu/csd. The Moses Center is
located at 726 Broadway on the 2nd floor.
Diversity & Inclusion
7
The Institute is committed to creating an inclusive learning environment. The
Institute embraces a notion of intellectual community enriched and enhanced
by diversity along a number of dimensions.
A Word on Trigger Warnings
Over the past few years a heated debate has raged in academia (if you can say
anything rages in academia) over the use of “trigger warnings.” One common
definition of a trigger warning is “a statement at the start of a piece of writing,
video, etc., alerting the reader or viewer to the fact that it contains potentially
distressing material (often used tointroduce a description of such content).”
Trigger warning proponents point out that some students in any given class
may have suffered some level of trauma, whether it arises from sexual assault,
violence, or other types of abuse. They should therefore receive fair warning
when a reading or discussion relates to material that could cause them
discomfort.
Trigger warning critics contend that the world is often messy, disturbing, and
violent, and that a master’s program in journalism is a time for intellectual
growth and emotional development. For this to occur, a professor’s role is to
challenge students so they learn to engage rationally with arguments, ideas,
opinions, and principles they might find upsetting or even deeply offensive.
While NYU does not subscribe to any university-wide position on trigger
warnings – the administration advises anyone who might be traumatized by a
reading or video to seek appropriate help at the university’s health center –
the journalism faculty believes our entire profession should come stamped
with a giant trigger warning. Part of what we do as journalists is to seek the
truth no matter where it may lead. This can sometimes take us into violent,
disturbing places.
In this course we will read and discuss articles and view videothat can at
times deal with disturbing themes, which include sexual assault, violence, war
and combat, terrorism, disease, racism and sexism.
If these are topics you believe could trigger in you any psychologicalor health
problems, you should not take this course.
8
At times you may find yourself vehemently disagreeing with the writer of an
essay, article, feature story, interview subject on camera, another student, a
guest, or even your professor. I encourage you to speak up and share your
perspectives. But do it in a way that fosters mutual respect. Be aware that
reasonable people can sometimes hold views that may appear “extreme” to
some.
The Syllabus
A syllabus is simply a guidepost for the semester. While I’ll try to stick to this
schedule we may skip around if the natural flow of the lessons dictate. No
class is the same; if you have additional ideas for topics we should cover, I'm
all ears. Sometimes links to articles can disappear or change. If so, let me
know and I’ll find alternative sources. I expect you to read the assigned
material but that doesn’t mean we’ll always have time to discuss everything in
class. Nevertheless, these are high quality stories well worth the effort. By
analyzing them you will be further on yourway to becoming a better writer.

WRITING/REPORT WKSHP II BUSINESS
& ECONOMIC REPORTING (Online)
Spring 2021
Course Description
This writing course focuses on the various components and approaches to
in-depth feature stories. We’ll dissect great modern and classic works of
journalism for story, character, dialogue, scenes, structure, transitions, verb
tense, point of view, style and impact. The goal is to create memorable nonfiction stories that hold a reader’s attention to the last word.
This is a challenging course with a heavy reading load and a high bar for
writing assignments, befitting graduate journalism students at New York
University. The emphasis is on learning by doing, with regular reporting and
writing assignments inside and outside of class. These include a profile, firstperson story, in-class writing exercises, a case study involving an in-depth
interview with a working journalist, and at the end of the semester a 2,000-
word feature story that displays dogged reporting and strong, evocative
writing. Along the way we’ll work on your pitches, discuss your research,
share interview techniques, as well as address techniques for time
management, creating strong outlines and multiple drafts, improve your
editing and, confront other professional challenges.
Over the course of the semester I will meet with each of you individually to
discuss your work and progress, and to find out how I can help you achieve
your dreams in journalism whatever they might be.

Learning Objectives
In this course, students will:
• Demonstrate awareness of journalism’s core ethical values
• Write clear, accurate and engaging prose in anaudienceappropriate manner
• Engage in critical thinking, independence, and creativity
appropriate to the role of journalism in a democraticsociety
• Interview subjects, conduct research, and evaluate information
• Work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness, anddiverse
perspectives
• Experience launching and operating a new website
• Read some of the finest feature writing from the past and the
present
• Explore the art and craft of feature writing through various realworld assignments
• Learn about structure, character development, point of view,
attribution, ethics, and other aspects of good journalisticwriting
• Improve grammar, punctuation, structure, and the like
Course Structure
This is a writing workshop with lectures, ample discussions and
workshopping, as well as pitch sessions and student presentations.
Sometimes we’ll do writing exercises in class. Beforehand there is usually
required reading.
In class over Zoom I will explain how to take apart long-form stories for
content: the lede, nut graf (if applicable), use of quotes and/or dialogue,
character arcs, pacing, point of view, etc., which are integral to writing good
long-form features. We’ll critique great and perhaps not-so-great feature
stories and other media. Sometimes we’ll break into small groups to engage in
peer editing, discussions, or complete writing exercises. I’ll also lecture on
topics relevant to journalists working today, as well as on the various ethical,
legal and cultural aspects of journalism.
Required Reading
3
There is no textbook for this class. Instead, I will regularly assign articles,
research studies, and other relevant material, including a series of modules
that covers grammar and punctuation, AP Style, fact-checking, digital
verification, and the NYU Journalism Handbook. Some come with graded
knowledge checks to test your comprehension and mastery of the material. I
have also created a significant amount of my own material that covers the
craft of journalism (reporting, interviews, writing), the history of journalism,
media law and other topics.
Writing Assignments
Over the course of the semester, you will have four major written
assignments:
Profile (1200 words): An in-depth profile of a person (not a company or
organization) doing something important, whether heading an intriguing
startup or running for political office. You must have a minimum of three
additional quoted sources in your story, people who can shed light on your
profile subject.
First-person story 1,000 words): An article written in the first person that
features you doing something interesting. In the past a student went to a gun
range to write about his experience firing an assault weapon. Another student
went to a ‘rage room’ to smash things. A third worked at a soup kitchen. In
general, the more interesting the experience, the better the story.
Journalism case study (1200 words): Interview a journalist about a
magazine feature story you admire and deconstruct each step the writer took
– from the initial idea, interviews, research and reporting, the editing process
to final publication and the impact the article had. I will provide samples of
successful journalism case studies I’ve received over the years on which you
can base yours.
Feature story (2000 words): A magazine feature story that exhibits deep
research and multiple interviews, and which brings together everything you
learned over the course of the semester. You’ll complete two drafts. After the
first draft I’ll assign you a professional features editor or writer to give you
extensive feedback for your second draft.

Course Requirements
Students are expected to read and/or view all assigned materials in advance
of class. If you miss class, there is no excuse for not getting in touch with me in
advance. For any excused absence – in the event of a serious illness, death in 
5
the family, or an approved athletic event, for example – I may ask you to
submit documentation. (In the event of a religious holiday, there is no need of
documentation. Just alert me in advance.)
If you have two unexcused absences, you can lose a half point off your final
grade (“B+” lowered to “B,” and so on.) Three unexcused absences could result
in a full point off. If you skip more than three classes, you could fail.
You must log in to class on time. If you are late to more than one class zoom
session, your grade could be affected. Don’t ask if you can miss class or
come late because you have scheduled an interview with a source who
claims she can only make that time.
Class participation is essential. Students must be prepared to present their
assignments in class, participate in group discussions and workshops and
work in teams. Everyone is expected to participate. This also goes for
discussions involving each week’s reading. I will call on students to talk about
various aspects of each article, so be prepared. That means reading carefully
all of the assigned work in advance of class. To be a good writer you have to
read. A lot. And be able to dissect others’ work.
This is an online course and we meets once a week over Zoom. Try to stay
focused in class. While it may be tempting to surf the Web and shop for shoes
an Amazon or check Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram while we are meeting,
please stay focused. You must have our video camera turned on for the
duration of class.
Twitter
Twitter has become the de facto platform for journalists. It’s not only an
excellent way to market your work; it’s also a useful media filter. The higher
the caliber of people you follow, the higher the quality of the information you
can process. It’s not about tweeting about what you had for lunch, your cat’s
latest trick or why you are so fond of chocolate cupcakes. It’s what my
colleague Prof. Jay Rosen calls “mindcasting.” Sign up for Twitter (if you
already haven’t) and “follow” selected journalists, media critics, and thinkers
relevant to business, technology, the media industry and your chosen blog
beat. Stay focused; don’t stray. An easy way to amass people to follow is to
search for reporters, editors, and businesspeople on your beat and select from 
6
their list of followers. You should tweet every day, multiple times, if possible.
That’s the only way for you to attract a following and introduce yourself to the
community of journalists. My Twitter handle is @penenberg.
Grading
Final grades calculated as follows:
1. Profile (1,200 words) = 20% of your final grade
2. First-person story: 1,000-word article featuring you = 20%
3. Journalist case study (1,200 words). Interview a working
journalist about a favorite narrative story and write a casestudy =
10%
4. Final feature story (2,000+ words, 2 drafts). Final draft due at the
beginning of the final class. You must file each draft of your story
on deadline. Handing in your first draft late could result in a full
grade off your final story (A becomes a B, B a C, and so on.) = 30%
5. Interactive modules = 10%
6. Class participation & in-class writing assignments = 10%
File your assignments in Microsoft Word or send me a link to your story in
Google Docs (be sure to give me editing privileges). Label your file with your
name (last name.first name) and the date (day, month, year). Like this:
or equivalent.
Rewrites (i.e. second drafts) are optional. If you choose to rewrite an
assignment, I will replace the original grade with what I assume will be a
significantly higher one.
Accommodations
Students with disabilities that necessitate accommodations should contact
and register with New York University’s Moses Center for Students with
Disabilities (CSD) at. Information about
the Moses Center can be found The Moses Center is
located at 726 Broadway on the 2nd floor.
Diversity & Inclusion
7
The Institute is committed to creating an inclusive learning environment. The
Institute embraces a notion of intellectual community enriched and enhanced
by diversity along a number of dimensions.
A Word on Trigger Warnings
Over the past few years a heated debate has raged in academia (if you can say
anything rages in academia) over the use of “trigger warnings.” One common
definition of a trigger warning is “a statement at the start of a piece of writing,
video, etc., alerting the reader or viewer to the fact that it contains potentially
distressing material (often used tointroduce a description of such content).”
Trigger warning proponents point out that some students in any given class
may have suffered some level of trauma, whether it arises from sexual assault,
violence, or other types of abuse. They should therefore receive fair warning
when a reading or discussion relates to material that could cause them
discomfort.
Trigger warning critics contend that the world is often messy, disturbing, and
violent, and that a master’s program in journalism is a time for intellectual
growth and emotional development. For this to occur, a professor’s role is to
challenge students so they learn to engage rationally with arguments, ideas,
opinions, and principles they might find upsetting or even deeply offensive.
While NYU does not subscribe to any university-wide position on trigger
warnings – the administration advises anyone who might be traumatized by a
reading or video to seek appropriate help at the university’s health center –
the journalism faculty believes our entire profession should come stamped
with a giant trigger warning. Part of what we do as journalists is to seek the
truth no matter where it may lead. This can sometimes take us into violent,
disturbing places.
In this course we will read and discuss articles and view videothat can at
times deal with disturbing themes, which include sexual assault, violence, war
and combat, terrorism, disease, racism and sexism.
If these are topics you believe could trigger in you any psychologicalor health
problems, you should not take this course.
8
At times you may find yourself vehemently disagreeing with the writer of an
essay, article, feature story, interview subject on camera, another student, a
guest, or even your professor. I encourage you to speak up and share your
perspectives. But do it in a way that fosters mutual respect. Be aware that
reasonable people can sometimes hold views that may appear “extreme” to
some.
The Syllabus
A syllabus is simply a guidepost for the semester. While I’ll try to stick to this
schedule we may skip around if the natural flow of the lessons dictate. No
class is the same; if you have additional ideas for topics we should cover, I'm
all ears. Sometimes links to articles can disappear or change. If so, let me
know and I’ll find alternative sources. I expect you to read the assigned
material but that doesn’t mean we’ll always have time to discuss everything in
class. Nevertheless, these are high quality stories well worth the effort. By
analyzing them you will be further on yourway to becoming a better writer.

Prerequisites
As detailed in the departmental web page (see link).
Course Description
“The book of the universe is written in the language of mathematics.” Galileo wrote this four
hundred years ago, even before Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus. The statement is
as valid today as ever: We use functions in all the sciences, and calculus allows us to
analyze the functions and draw scientific conclusions.
In this course, we will study the foundations of calculus, the study of functions and their rates
of change. We want you to learn how to model situations in order to solve problems. If you
2
have already taken calculus before, we want you to gain an even deeper understanding of
this fascinating subject and its numerous applications.
The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function. The definite integral
measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. These two ideas form the
basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science. The rules by which we can compute the
derivative (respectively, the integral) of any function are called a calculus. The Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus links the two processes of differentiation and integration in a beautiful
way.
Course Objectives
Upon Completion of this Course, students will be able to:
● Recall the definitions of the fundamental objects in the theory of Calculus, such as
limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals.
● Formally state theorems describing the nature of the objects above, such as the
mean value theorem, the extreme value theorem, and the two fundamental theorems
of Calculus.
● Exploit the laws regulating the objects above to perform meaningful computations of
limits, derivatives, and integrals.
● Apply the computations of limits, derivatives, and integrals to a wide range of
disciplines, such as physics and economics.
Assessment Components
If you are an NYU London study-away student, you are expected to attend in person. If you
are accessing the class remotely, you must attend synchronously.
Students in this course will:
● submit participation worksheets at the end of the class
● complete regularly-due WebAssign homework
● solve the exercises provided in form of weekly problem sheets
● write a project on a chosen real life application of calculus
● take a midterm exam (summative assessment), and
● a final exam (summative assessment).
Participation Worksheets
You are expected to attend class in person or remote synchronously. Your active participation
in class and attendance will be reflected in this part of the course requirements.
Questions during lectures are actively encouraged and some degree of active participation is
required from all students. However, it is appreciated that not all students feel comfortable
with in-class interaction, and the aim of the course is to establish an environment based on
collaboration rather than on competition. As a result, participation will be assessed solely
3
through the completion of short worksheets to be submitted by the end of class to your
instructor or, if following remotely, on Brightspace.
Each worksheet contains two questions, about aspects that are fundamental for the
understanding of the topic discussed. During the classroom, there will be two slots of 5
minutes where students are encouraged to complete the worksheet. During this time, they
are encouraged to work with their classmates and they can ask questions to the instructor to
complete the worksheet at their best. If a student makes a genuine attempt at all the
questions, they will get full participation marks.
Homework
Assignments for the course will be of two kinds, all due on Fridays by 5:00pm (UK time).
● Cengage WebAssign There will be assignments administered through WebAssign
(this comes together with the Cengage subscription that each student needs to
purchase). WebAssign problems are computational in nature and assess the
mathematical techniques introduced in class. You will get immediate feedback on
your progress and will get up to 5 attempts at each problem. For your convenience, a
link to WebAssign will be available on the course Brightspace page. No extension
can be granted for solving this type of homework, as the solutions will be made
available shortly after the deadline.
● Written problem sheets (submitted through Brightspace) These consist of problems
that are closely related to the questions in the exams. They can be downloaded 10
days before the deadline from Brightspace. Students have to closely follow the
instructions and write their answers neatly and clearly; solutions have to be uploaded
to Brightspace as a single PDF file. They can be printed and scanned or
photographed, as long as the writing is readable. Please review your PDF to make
sure it is complete and clear before submitting. All solutions need to be properly
justified. Failure to demonstrate all work and steps in the solution of a problem may
result in zero credit for the problem. Students are encouraged to form study groups
and work together on homework outside of class time, but they cannot copy others’
work, not even partially. It is advised that students begin assignments soon after
topics are covered in lecture. Due dates are chosen to help students review the
material discussed during the week in a timely manner. In fairness to graders and
other students in the course, late homework will be accepted only in case of
extenuating circumstances. Extensions can be granted only before the deadline
and they can not amount to more than 5 days after the official deadline, when
solutions will be released. However, the 2 worksheets with lower marks will be
dropped from the final count.
Individual projects
Calculus has a plethora of real world applications. On top of those that will be seen together
in class, students will work in detail on an application of their own choice by completing an
individual project containing a brief explanation of the topic and an example that uses the
material learned in class. An outline of the project, consisting of a title, a description of
4
application, an abstract, and a tentative list of references has to be submitted by October 31.
The final outcome of the project is to be submitted by November 30. Students have two
options for how they would like to present their work:
● a written paper (~ 4-8 pages), or
● a video recording (~ 4-8 minutes).
These guidelines are not a hard limit, but the evaluation of the project will take length into
account, as well as quality of content. The students will receive a list of suggested projects
and personalized one-on-one guidance by the instructor. A detailed guide will be posted on
Brightspace.
Exams
There will be two written exams, one midterm and one final. An excused absence for an
exam requires notification to the instructor BEFORE the exam starts, followed by valid
documentation. Otherwise, you will receive a “0” for any missed exams.
• Midterm: October 20th if in person (see schedule), or TBD if take-home.
• Final: during undergraduate final exam week, time: TBD

● All times are UK time (Daylight Saving Time ends 31 October).
● Location: Room 102 @ 6 Bedford Sq
● Remote Participants: Zoom links are provided in Brightspace.

Prerequisites
As detailed in the departmental web page (see link).
Course Description
“The book of the universe is written in the language of mathematics.” Galileo wrote this four
hundred years ago, even before Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus. The statement is
as valid today as ever: We use functions in all the sciences, and calculus allows us to
analyze the functions and draw scientific conclusions.
In this course, we will study the foundations of calculus, the study of functions and their rates
of change. We want you to learn how to model situations in order to solve problems. If you
2
have already taken calculus before, we want you to gain an even deeper understanding of
this fascinating subject and its numerous applications.
The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function. The definite integral
measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. These two ideas form the
basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science. The rules by which we can compute the
derivative (respectively, the integral) of any function are called a calculus. The Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus links the two processes of differentiation and integration in a beautiful
way.
Course Objectives
Upon Completion of this Course, students will be able to:
● Recall the definitions of the fundamental objects in the theory of Calculus, such as
limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals.
● Formally state theorems describing the nature of the objects above, such as the
mean value theorem, the extreme value theorem, and the two fundamental theorems
of Calculus.
● Exploit the laws regulating the objects above to perform meaningful computations of
limits, derivatives, and integrals.
● Apply the computations of limits, derivatives, and integrals to a wide range of
disciplines, such as physics and economics.
Assessment Components
If you are an NYU London study-away student, you are expected to attend in person. If you
are accessing the class remotely, you must attend synchronously.
Students in this course will:
● submit participation worksheets at the end of the class
● complete regularly-due WebAssign homework
● solve the exercises provided in form of weekly problem sheets
● write a project on a chosen real life application of calculus
● take a midterm exam (summative assessment), and
● a final exam (summative assessment).
Participation Worksheets
You are expected to attend class in person or remote synchronously. Your active participation
in class and attendance will be reflected in this part of the course requirements.
Questions during lectures are actively encouraged and some degree of active participation is
required from all students. However, it is appreciated that not all students feel comfortable
with in-class interaction, and the aim of the course is to establish an environment based on
collaboration rather than on competition. As a result, participation will be assessed solely
3
through the completion of short worksheets to be submitted by the end of class to your
instructor or, if following remotely, on Brightspace.
Each worksheet contains two questions, about aspects that are fundamental for the
understanding of the topic discussed. During the classroom, there will be two slots of 5
minutes where students are encouraged to complete the worksheet. During this time, they
are encouraged to work with their classmates and they can ask questions to the instructor to
complete the worksheet at their best. If a student makes a genuine attempt at all the
questions, they will get full participation marks.
Homework
Assignments for the course will be of two kinds, all due on Fridays by 5:00pm (UK time).
● Cengage WebAssign There will be assignments administered through WebAssign
(this comes together with the Cengage subscription that each student needs to
purchase). WebAssign problems are computational in nature and assess the
mathematical techniques introduced in class. You will get immediate feedback on
your progress and will get up to 5 attempts at each problem. For your convenience, a
link to WebAssign will be available on the course Brightspace page. No extension
can be granted for solving this type of homework, as the solutions will be made
available shortly after the deadline.
● Written problem sheets (submitted through Brightspace) These consist of problems
that are closely related to the questions in the exams. They can be downloaded 10
days before the deadline from Brightspace. Students have to closely follow the
instructions and write their answers neatly and clearly; solutions have to be uploaded
to Brightspace as a single PDF file. They can be printed and scanned or
photographed, as long as the writing is readable. Please review your PDF to make
sure it is complete and clear before submitting. All solutions need to be properly
justified. Failure to demonstrate all work and steps in the solution of a problem may
result in zero credit for the problem. Students are encouraged to form study groups
and work together on homework outside of class time, but they cannot copy others’
work, not even partially. It is advised that students begin assignments soon after
topics are covered in lecture. Due dates are chosen to help students review the
material discussed during the week in a timely manner. In fairness to graders and
other students in the course, late homework will be accepted only in case of
extenuating circumstances. Extensions can be granted only before the deadline
and they can not amount to more than 5 days after the official deadline, when
solutions will be released. However, the 2 worksheets with lower marks will be
dropped from the final count.
Individual projects
Calculus has a plethora of real world applications. On top of those that will be seen together
in class, students will work in detail on an application of their own choice by completing an
individual project containing a brief explanation of the topic and an example that uses the
material learned in class. An outline of the project, consisting of a title, a description of
4
application, an abstract, and a tentative list of references has to be submitted by October 31.
The final outcome of the project is to be submitted by November 30. Students have two
options for how they would like to present their work:
● a written paper (~ 4-8 pages), or
● a video recording (~ 4-8 minutes).
These guidelines are not a hard limit, but the evaluation of the project will take length into
account, as well as quality of content. The students will receive a list of suggested projects
and personalized one-on-one guidance by the instructor. A detailed guide will be posted on
Brightspace.
Exams
There will be two written exams, one midterm and one final. An excused absence for an
exam requires notification to the instructor BEFORE the exam starts, followed by valid
documentation. Otherwise, you will receive a “0” for any missed exams.

New York University
Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute
Syllabus JOUR-GA-1019-001
THE EDITOR’S VISION
Spring 2021
Professor: Alexis L Gelber
Thursday, 4:00 PM - 7:40 PM
Remote class via Zoom
Office hours: Thursday, 3-4 p.m., or by appointment
By phone or Zoom
Course Description
How do editors create a distinctive identity for their publications? This course will look at
iconic print magazines and new digital platforms, exploring how writing, design,
photography, graphics and audio/visual features convey the editor’s ambitions and the
personality of a publication. In class discussions and written assignments, students will
think as editors, rather than just as reporters and writers, as they do in other classes. As a
semester-long project, students will apply the lessons they have learned by creating a new
Editor’s Vision digital publication. Throughout the term, the students will spend class
time developing ideas and design concepts for the publication, as well as writing,
workshopping, designing and editing stories for the site, which will debut toward the end
of the semester.
Learning Objectives
In this course, students will:
• Demonstrate an analytical understanding of the elements of a successful
publication and develop their skills as conceptual thinkers and text editors.
• Work individually on essays and research projects and collaboratively on a
creative team project.
• Write clear, accurate and engaging prose in an audience-appropriate manner
• Interview subjects, conduct research, and evaluate information
• Use technological tools and apply quantitative concepts as appropriate
Course Structure
The course will include class discussions; talks by guest speakers (prominent editors,
writers, reporters and designers); assigned readings; case studies; and work developing a
themed class website, in conjunction with NYU digital staff.
Readings
Required reading for the course:
2
Book excerpts to be distributed to class: The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American
Century, by Alan Brinkley; The Years with Ross, by James Thurber (New Introduction by
Adam Gopnik); New York Stories: Landmark Writing from Four Decades of New York
Magazine, Foreward by Tom Wolfe
Required viewing: The September Issue – A Film by R.J. Cutler; The Bold Type
(Streaming series)
Other excerpts and articles will be listed on this syllabus or assigned in class.
Suggested readings include: Ben Smith’s Media column in the Monday NYT Business
section; media columns in New York Magazine, Politico, New York Post, Vanity Fair
Email newsletters: Brian Stelter’s Reliable Sources/CNN; Axios; Punchbowl News; The
Cut; The Hive
Course Requirements
Class participation is vital to this course and will be factored into the final grade. Students
are expected to keep up with assigned readings; bring in articles to analyze in class;
maintain a high attendance record; workshop written assignments and articles for the
class website; work collaboratively with classmates; submit assignments that uphold the
highest level of academic and journalistic integrity.
Grading
Final grades will be calculated as follows:
Personal Essay about a magazine that influenced you. First draft due Tuesday, 2/2/21 by
noon; 20 percent of final grade.
Students will write an 850-word essay about a publication or series of publications that
affected their decision to pursue journalism or otherwise affected their lives.
Midterm research paper. First draft due Tuesday, 3/2/21 by noon; 30 percent of final
grade.
Paper will focus on a publication that started in the 20th century or earlier and trace its
evolution to the present day, with particular emphasis on a key editor.
Final project: Class website. Final presentation to faculty on 5/6/21. Work on this
project throughout the semester will account for 50 percent of final grade.
Students will create, write, edit and design their own digital publication for
editorsvision.com. Grades will be determined by the level of conceptual work, writing,
participation, editing ability and leadership skills.

THE EDITOR’S VISION
Spring 2021
Course Description
How do editors create a distinctive identity for their publications? This course will look at
iconic print magazines and new digital platforms, exploring how writing, design,
photography, graphics and audio/visual features convey the editor’s ambitions and the
personality of a publication. In class discussions and written assignments, students will
think as editors, rather than just as reporters and writers, as they do in other classes. As a
semester-long project, students will apply the lessons they have learned by creating a new
Editor’s Vision digital publication. Throughout the term, the students will spend class
time developing ideas and design concepts for the publication, as well as writing,
workshopping, designing and editing stories for the site, which will debut toward the end
of the semester.
Learning Objectives
In this course, students will:
• Demonstrate an analytical understanding of the elements of a successful
publication and develop their skills as conceptual thinkers and text editors.
• Work individually on essays and research projects and collaboratively on a
creative team project.
• Write clear, accurate and engaging prose in an audience-appropriate manner
• Interview subjects, conduct research, and evaluate information
• Use technological tools and apply quantitative concepts as appropriate
Course Structure
The course will include class discussions; talks by guest speakers (prominent editors,
writers, reporters and designers); assigned readings; case studies; and work developing a
themed class website, in conjunction with NYU digital staff.
Readings
Required reading for the course:
2
Book excerpts to be distributed to class: The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American
Century, by Alan Brinkley; The Years with Ross, by James Thurber (New Introduction by

Magazine, Foreward by Tom Wolfe
Required viewing: The September Issue – A Film by R.J. Cutler; The Bold Type
(Streaming series)
Other excerpts and articles will be listed on this syllabus or assigned in class.
Suggested readings include: Ben Smith’s Media column in the Monday NYT Business
section; media columns in New York Magazine, Politico, New York Post, Vanity Fair
Email newsletters: Brian Stelter’s Reliable Sources/CNN; Axios; Punchbowl News; The
Cut; The Hive
Course Requirements
Class participation is vital to this course and will be factored into the final grade. Students
are expected to keep up with assigned readings; bring in articles to analyze in class;
maintain a high attendance record; workshop written assignments and articles for the
class website; work collaboratively with classmates; submit assignments that uphold the
highest level of academic and journalistic integrity.
Grading
Final grades will be calculated as follows:
Personal Essay about a magazine that influenced you. First draft due Tuesday, 2/2/21 by
noon; 20 percent of final grade.
Students will write an 850-word essay about a publication or series of publications that
affected their decision to pursue journalism or otherwise affected their lives.
Midterm research paper. First draft due Tuesday, 3/2/21 by noon; 30 percent of final
grade.
Paper will focus on a publication that started in the 20th century or earlier and trace its
evolution to the present day, with particular emphasis on a key editor.
Final project: Class website. Final presentation to faculty on 5/6/21. Work on this
project throughout the semester will account for 50 percent of final grade.
Students will create, write, edit and design their own digital publication for
editorsvision.com. Grades will be determined by the level of conceptual work, writing,
participation, editing ability and leadership skills.

Syllabus

Overview: The decision of where to locate is essential for both business and individuals. It determines the profits of firms
through the cost of inputs, market size, the level of competition, and the policy environment they face. It also determines
the job opportunities, schooling, and other amenities accessible to individuals. In turn, firm and individual decisions
aggregate to determine the performance of cities and regions. This course studies business and individual location decisions
and how they determine the main economic forces that lead to the existence and performance of cities and regional
agglomerations. The course starts by developing a simple theory of cities and its implications for city size, firm productivity,
and housing prices. It then studies evidence on the impact of cities on firm and worker productivity, urban amenities, and
congestion. We will discuss the problems in measuring these forces, the methodologies to do so, as well as the implications
of this measurement for businesses, individuals, and urban policy. We will also study the internal structure of cities, and
how to evaluate the effect of new infrastructure or policy on land and housing values and overall welfare. Finally, the
course will analyze the role cities and regions play in aggregate economic development.
Grading: Your grade will be based on class participation, a class presentation, and a course project. Class participation
consists of reading the articles assigned for the class and being ready to discuss them, as well as generally contributing to
the class discussion. The class presentation will be on your urban policy project and will be scheduled during the last two
weeks of the course. A written draft of your project is due on May 5th, 2021. The project should be a policy proposal on
an urban issue. It can range from a specific investment or policy in one city to a wide-ranging business or policy
encompassing a region or many cities in a country. The project should be clearly structured, have an economic evaluation,
and a clear discussion of the arguments in favor and against its implementation. Your arguments should be based on
relevant data and theory. In general, it helps to be specific. Group work is encouraged but not necessary. Groups should
have no more than 3 students. Class participation will count for 20% of your grade, the class presentation for 30%, and
the final project for 50%.

Overview: The decision of where to locate is essential for both business and individuals. It determines the profits of firms
through the cost of inputs, market size, the level of competition, and the policy environment they face. It also determines
the job opportunities, schooling, and other amenities accessible to individuals. In turn, firm and individual decisions
aggregate to determine the performance of cities and regions. This course studies business and individual location decisions
and how they determine the main economic forces that lead to the existence and performance of cities and regional
agglomerations. The course starts by developing a simple theory of cities and its implications for city size, firm productivity,
and housing prices. It then studies evidence on the impact of cities on firm and worker productivity, urban amenities, and
congestion. We will discuss the problems in measuring these forces, the methodologies to do so, as well as the implications
of this measurement for businesses, individuals, and urban policy. We will also study the internal structure of cities, and
how to evaluate the effect of new infrastructure or policy on land and housing values and overall welfare. Finally, the
course will analyze the role cities and regions play in aggregate economic development.
Grading: Your grade will be based on class participation, a class presentation, and a course project. Class participation
consists of reading the articles assigned for the class and being ready to discuss them, as well as generally contributing to
the class discussion. The class presentation will be on your urban policy project and will be scheduled during the last two
weeks of the course. A written draft of your project is due on May 5th, 2021. The project should be a policy proposal on
an urban issue. It can range from a specific investment or policy in one city to a wide-ranging business or policy
encompassing a region or many cities in a country. The project should be clearly structured, have an economic evaluation,
and a clear discussion of the arguments in favor and against its implementation. Your arguments should be based on
relevant data and theory. In general, it helps to be specific. Group work is encouraged but not necessary. Groups should
have no more than 3 students. Class participation will count for 20% of your grade, the class presentation for 30%, and
the final project for 50%.

Overview: The decision of where to locate is essential for both business and individuals. It determines the profits of firms
through the cost of inputs, market size, the level of competition, and the policy environment they face. It also determines

aggregate to determine the performance of cities and regions. This course studies business and individual location decisions
and how they determine the main economic forces that lead to the existence and performance of cities and regional
agglomerations. The course starts by developing a simple theory of cities and its implications for city size, firm productivity,

congestion. We will discuss the problems in measuring these forces, the methodologies to do so, as well as the implications
of this measurement for businesses, individuals, and urban policy. We will also study the internal structure of cities, and
how to evaluate the effect of new infrastructure or policy on land and housing values and overall welfare. Finally, the
course will analyze the role cities and regions play in aggregate economic development.
Grading: Your grade will be based on class participation, a class presentation, and a course project. Class participation
consists of reading the articles assigned for the class and being ready to discuss them, as well as generally contributing to
the class discussion. The class presentation will be on your urban policy project and will be scheduled during the last two
weeks of the course. A written draft of your project is due on May 5th, 2021. The project should be a policy proposal on
an urban issue. It can range from a specific investment or policy in one city to a wide-ranging business or policy
encompassing a region or many cities in a country. The project should be clearly structured, have an economic evaluation,
and a clear discussion of the arguments in favor and against its implementation. Your arguments should be based on
relevant data and theory. In general, it helps to be specific. Group work is encouraged but not necessary. Groups should
have no more than 3 students. Class participation will count for 20% of your grade, the class presentation for 30%, and
the final project for 50%.

Syllabus

Overview: The decision of where to locate is essential for both business and individuals. It determines the profits of firms
through the cost of inputs, market size, the level of competition, and the policy environment they face. It also determines
the job opportunities, schooling, and other amenities accessible to individuals. In turn, firm and individual decisions
aggregate to determine the performance of cities and regions. This course studies business and individual location decisions
and how they determine the main economic forces that lead to the existence and performance of cities and regional
agglomerations. The course starts by developing a simple theory of cities and its implications for city size, firm productivity,
and housing prices. It then studies evidence on the impact of cities on firm and worker productivity, urban amenities, and
congestion. We will discuss the problems in measuring these forces, the methodologies to do so, as well as the implications
of this measurement for businesses, individuals, and urban policy. We will also study the internal structure of cities, and
how to evaluate the effect of new infrastructure or policy on land and housing values and overall welfare. Finally, the
course will analyze the role cities and regions play in aggregate economic development.
Grading: Your grade will be based on class participation, a class presentation, and a course project. Class participation
consists of reading the articles assigned for the class and being ready to discuss them, as well as generally contributing to
the class discussion. The class presentation will be on your urban policy project and will be scheduled during the last two
weeks of the course. A written draft of your project is due on May 5th, 2021. The project should be a policy proposal on
an urban issue. It can range from a specific investment or policy in one city to a wide-ranging business or policy
encompassing a region or many cities in a country. The project should be clearly structured, have an economic evaluation,
and a clear discussion of the arguments in favor and against its implementation. Your arguments should be based on
relevant data and theory. In general, it helps to be specific. Group work is encouraged but not necessary. Groups should
have no more than 3 students. Class participation will count for 20% of your grade, the class presentation for 30%, and
the final project for 50%.

• Explain how operations and supply chain practices contribute to the overall competitiveness of any
organization and its value chains.
• Recognize and evaluate operational challenges and opportunities from a holistic perspective.
• Apply various concepts, methods, and tools by structuring, analyzing, and solving complex operational
problems.
• Generate questions and curiosity to encourage future learning in operations and supply chain
management.
How This Course Works:
Mode of delivery: All lectures and recitations are synchronous. The lectures are virtual synchronous using
zoom. Depending on your assigned section, recitations are synchronous in-person or virtual synchronous
using zoom.
Pace of online activities: This course is divided into weekly modules that are released one week ahead of
time. Students are expected to keep pace with weekly deadlines (Monday Midnight) but may schedule their
efforts freely within that time frame.
Credit hours and work expectations: This is a 3-credit-hour course. According to Ohio State policy, students
should expect around an average of 3 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (instructor content
and Carmen activities, for example) in addition to 6 hours of homework (reading and assignment preparation,
for example).
Attendance and participation requirements: Your presence in class is mandatory. All in-class assignments are
graded for accuracy. The following is a summary of everyone's expected participation:
• Preparation for Lecture:
You are expected to complete SmartBook (SB) assignment prior to Lecture. The SB provides the
foundation for the student to participate in Lecture for the week’s topics.
• Live Lecture sessions:
During the live lecture, the week’s topic will be presented and discussed. In-class assignments will
enable engagement and achievement of learning outcomes through active learning. All assignements
are graded for accuracy and due by END of your registered lecture.
• Live Recitation sessions:
Students will be working individually and in teams to complete assignments involving problems related
to each weekly topic. Assignments are graded for accuracy and due by END of your registered
recitation.

Academic integrity:
Academic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in teaching, research,
and other educational and scholarly activities. Thus, The Ohio State University and the Committee on
Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have read and understand the University's Code of
Student Conduct, and that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and
honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the rules and guidelines established in the University's
Code of Student Conduct (https://trustees.osu.edu/bylaws-and-rules/code) and this syllabus may constitute
Academic Misconduct (https://oaa.osu.edu/academic-integrity-and-misconduct)
The Ohio State University's Code of Student Conduct (Section 3335-23-04) defines academic misconduct as:
Any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the University, or subvert the educational
process. Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized
collaboration), copying the work of another student, and possession of unauthorized materials during an
examination. Ignorance of the University's Code of Student Conduct is never considered an excuse for
academic misconduct, so I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and, specifically, the
sections dealing with academic misconduct.
If I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this course, I am obligated by University
Rules to report my suspicions to the Committee on Academic Misconduct. If COAM determines that you have
violated the University's Code of Student Conduct (i.e., committed academic misconduct), the sanctions for
the misconduct could include a failing grade in this course and suspension or dismissal from the University.
If you have any questions about the above policy or what constitutes academic misconduct in this course,
please contact me.
Disability Services:
The university strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. In light of the current
pandemic, students seeking to request COVID-related accommodations may do so through the
university’s request process, managed by Student Life Disability Services. If you anticipate or experience
academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic, or temporary medical
conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable
accommodations, I may request that you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration,
make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be
implemented in a timely fashion. SLDS contact information: slds@osu.edu; 614-292-3307; slds.osu.edu; 098
Baker Hall, 113 W. 12th Avenue.
Grievances and Solving Problems:
According to University Policies, if you have a problem with this class, you should seek to resolve the grievance
concerning a grade or academic practice by speaking first with the instructor or professor. Then, if necessary,

• Explain how operations and supply chain practices contribute to the overall competitiveness of any
organization and its value chains.
• Recognize and evaluate operational challenges and opportunities from a holistic perspective.
• Apply various concepts, methods, and tools by structuring, analyzing, and solving complex operational
problems.
• Generate questions and curiosity to encourage future learning in operations and supply chain
management.
How This Course Works:
Mode of delivery: All lectures and recitations are synchronous. The lectures are virtual synchronous using
zoom. Depending on your assigned section, recitations are synchronous in-person or virtual synchronous
using zoom.
Pace of online activities: This course is divided into weekly modules that are released one week ahead of
time. Students are expected to keep pace with weekly deadlines (Monday Midnight) but may schedule their
efforts freely within that time frame.
Credit hours and work expectations: This is a 3-credit-hour course. According to Ohio State policy, students
should expect around an average of 3 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (instructor content
and Carmen activities, for example) in addition to 6 hours of homework (reading and assignment preparation,
for example).
Attendance and participation requirements: Your presence in class is mandatory. All in-class assignments are
graded for accuracy. The following is a summary of everyone's expected participation:
• Preparation for Lecture:
You are expected to complete SmartBook (SB) assignment prior to Lecture. The SB provides the
foundation for the student to participate in Lecture for the week’s topics.
• Live Lecture sessions:

Academic integrity:
Academic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in teaching, research,
and other educational and scholarly activities. Thus, The Ohio State University and the Committee on
Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have read and understand the University's Code of
Student Conduct, and that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and
honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the rules and guidelines established in the University's
Code of Student Conduct (https://trustees.osu.edu/bylaws-and-rules/code) and this syllabus may constitute
Academic Misconduct (https://oaa.osu.edu/academic-integrity-and-misconduct)
The Ohio State University's Code of Student Conduct (Section 3335-23-04) defines academic misconduct as:
Any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the University, or subvert the educational
process. Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized
collaboration), copying the work of another student, and possession of unauthorized materials during an
examination. Ignorance of the University's Code of Student Conduct is never considered an excuse for
academic misconduct, so I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and, specifically, the
sections dealing with academic misconduct.
If I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this course, I am obligated by University
Rules to report my suspicions to the Committee on Academic Misconduct. If COAM determines that you have
violated the University's Code of Student Conduct (i.e., committed academic misconduct), the sanctions for
the misconduct could include a failing grade in this course and suspension or dismissal from the University.
If you have any questions about the above policy or what constitutes academic misconduct in this course,
please contact me.
Disability Services:
The university strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. In light of the current
pandemic, students seeking to request COVID-related accommodations may do so through the
university’s request process, managed by Student Life Disability Services. If you anticipate or experience
academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic, or temporary medical
conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable
accommodations, I may request that you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration,
make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be
implemented in a timely fashion. SLDS contact information: slds@osu.edu; 614-292-3307; slds.osu.edu; 098
Baker Hall, 113 W. 12th Avenue.
Grievances and Solving Problems:
According to University Policies, if you have a problem with this class, you should seek to resolve the grievance
concerning a grade or academic practice by speaking first with the instructor or professor. Then, if necessary,
take your case to the department chairperson, associate dean for programs in the college, and to the provost,
in that order. Specific procedures are outlined in Faculty Rule 3335-7-23. Grievances against graduate,
research, and teaching assistants should be submitted first to the supervising instructor, then to the
chairperson of the assistant's department

Feedback and Response Expectations:
• For grade discrepancy inquiry, please attend office hours for TA and/or Faculty
• For questions concerning Student Life Disability Services & Student Athlete Assistance,
Academic integrity:
Academic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in teaching, research,
and other educational and scholarly activities. Thus, The Ohio State University and the Committee on
Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have read and understand the University's Code of
Student Conduct, and that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and
honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the rules and guidelines established in the University's
Code of Student Conduct (https://trustees.osu.edu/bylaws-and-rules/code) and this syllabus may constitute
Academic Misconduct 
The Ohio State University's Code of Student Conduct (Section 3335-23-04) defines academic misconduct as:
Any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the University, or subvert the educational
process. Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized
collaboration), copying the work of another student, and possession of unauthorized materials during an
examination. Ignorance of the University's Code of Student Conduct is never considered an excuse for
academic misconduct, so I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and, specifically, the
sections dealing with academic misconduct.
If I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this course, I am obligated by University
Rules to report my suspicions to the Committee on Academic Misconduct. If COAM determines that you have
violated the University's Code of Student Conduct (i.e., committed academic misconduct), the sanctions for
the misconduct could include a failing grade in this course and suspension or dismissal from the University.
If you have any questions about the above policy or what constitutes academic misconduct in this course,
please contact me.
Disability Services:
The university strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. In light of the current
pandemic, students seeking to request COVID-related accommodations may do so through the
university’s request process, managed by Student Life Disability Services. If you anticipate or experience
academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic, or temporary medical
conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable
accommodations, I may request that you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration,
make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be
implemented in a timely fashion. SLDS contact information: 
Grievances and Solving Problems:
According to University Policies, if you have a problem with this class, you should seek to resolve the grievance
concerning a grade or academic practice by speaking first with the instructor or professor. Then, if necessary,
take your case to the department chairperson, associate dean for programs in the college, and to the provost,
in that order. Specific procedures are outlined in Faculty Rule 3335-7-23. Grievances against graduate,
research, and teaching assistants should be submitted first to the supervising instructor, then to the
chairperson of the assistant's department

the use of students officially enrolled in the course for the educational purposes associated with the course.
Copyright law must be considered before copying, retaining, or disseminating materials outside of the course.
Safety and health requirements:
All teaching staff and students are required to comply with and stay up to date on all University safety and health
guidance, which includes wearing a face mask in any indoor space and maintaining a safe physical distance at all times.
Non-compliance will be warned first and disciplinary actions will be taken for repeated offenses.

Course description
This course surveys selected topics in modern cognitive psychology with an emphasis on
memory, categorization, thinking, and problem solving. It is intended for undergraduate
students with basic knowledge of psychology (prerequisite Psych 1100). Some questions we
will consider are: What is cognitive psychology and how does it fit into the broader framework
of cognitive science? What methods do scientists use to study memory and high-level 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022

cognition? What behavioral regularities characterize memory? What kinds of memory are
there? Where does memory reside in the brain? What are some important theories and models
of memory? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How does one evaluate a scientific
theory? Can memory research help us study and remember better? Are the testimonies of
honest eyewitnesses always reliable? How do people classify things into categories? How are
concepts represented and organized in semantic memory? Are humans fundamentally rational
or irrational? What tools allow us to construct, and to understand, a reasoned argument? What
tools allow us to recognize a fallacious or fraudulent argument? What is the distinction
between deductive and inductive reasoning? How do people solve problems? What is the role
of insight in problem solving? Can the creative process be studied scientifically and, if so,
how? How can fluid intelligence and creativity be measured? Can they be improved?

GRADING AND FACULTY RESPONSE
How your grade is calculated
See course schedule below for the dates of the multiple-choice tests.
Your official grade in this course will be determined on the basis of three in-class exams during
the semester, one final exam during Finals week, 24 in-class quizzes, and 24 Carmen quizzes.
The lowest score of the four tests will be dropped and the other three test scores count toward
your grade as detailed below. Analogously, the four lowest scores of each quiz category will be
dropped. The maximum number of points for the course is 400. Your total points will be
converted to a letter grade at the end of the semester according to the following brackets:
The instructor and course assistant make every effort to ensure that the grades are accurate,
fair, and consistent. Nobody is immune to mistakes, however. If you believe that your test
and/or quiz results are in error, please let us know no later than one week after the results are
announced. Such notifications must be made in writing and emailed to petrov.11@osu.edu.
We will review your complaint carefully and answer by email or invite you to a personal
meeting with Dr. Petrov to discuss the issue. Complaints about test results, quiz results, or

Psych 3312 Spring 2022

anything else that affects your grade will not be considered or discussed unless a
written statement was emailed to the instructor or course assistant in advance. There
are no exceptions to these rules.
Descriptions of assessment categories
As we will study during the course, people remember much better when they study on a
regular basis rather than cramming in the last few hours before an exam. The organization of
this course capitalizes on this property of memory. There are three in-class exams and multiple
quizzes throughout the semester. There is also a cumulative final exam during Finals week.
MULTIPLE-CHOICE TESTS
Description: All exams are closed-book multiple-choice tests. They are based on material
from the lectures, the textbook, the additional required readings, and on certain videos that are
clearly marked in the lecture slides and linked on Carmen. The three in-class exams are noncumulative, whereas the final exam covers the material from the entire semester. Each exam
is worth 100 points. Everyone can have a bad day. That is why your worst test score will be
dropped from the evaluation: only the three best scores of the four tests will count toward
your grade. The total number of points that can be earned for the exams is 300. Thus, if
you are happy with your scores on the in-class tests, you can skip the final. Missed exams will
be graded with zero points. Makeup exams will only be given in cases of documented
emergency or when prior approval has been given to miss the exam. For example, I will need
an official note from the doctor’s office if you were sick. If you are late for the test, you will be
allowed to take it, but you must submit your answer sheet by the closing time like everybody
else. Please bring a photo ID, a #2 pencil, and an eraser to the test room.
Academic integrity: You must complete all tests yourself. Because there have been cases of
students using their smart watches to cheat and because it is difficult to differentiate a smart
watch from an ordinary one, all electronic watches must be put in your bags for the
duration of all tests. Once the test begins, no questions about any test item are allowed.
Please do not leave your seat until you are ready to turn your answer sheet in. After you turn it
in, leave the test room immediately. You are not allowed to discuss any test question with any
student who has not yet taken the test. Soliciting or disclosing any test-content information is a
serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct (studentconduct.osu.edu).
IN-CLASS QUIZZES
Description: As we will study during the course, research has clearly shown that good
learning outcomes require a significant investment of time on the part of the student. Attending
the lectures is a good start but is not enough. According to Rule 3335-8-24 of the OSU Bylaws 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022
7
on Instruction (http://go.osu.edu/credithours), students should expect around 9 hours per week
for a 3-credit course such as ours. This amounts to 6 hours of home study on top of the 3
hours of classroom time. Please read the pages from the textbook (and/or other required
readings as specified by the instructor) associated with each lecture prior to coming to class.
The in-class quizzes are based on material from the readings and are designed to verify and
reward the work you have done at home. They are closed-book and are given at the beginning
of class for up to 10 minutes. Each quiz is worth 3 points and typically consists of 3 shortanswer questions about the previous lecture and the current lecture. The 4 lowest-scoring
quizzes will be dropped at the end of the semester, and the points from the remaining
20 quizzes will count towards your final grade. Thus, the maximum number of points
that can be earned from in-class quizzes is 60 points. Attendance is required in the sense
that if you miss too many lectures you will also miss the associated quiz points, which in turn
will make it difficult to accumulate enough points for a good grade. Missed in-class quizzes
cannot be taken at a later date but you can substitute a 500-word essay about some material
from the lecture you have missed. Note that it is a bad essay (which will not receive many
points) if it simply paraphrases sentences taken from the textbook or the required readings.
Your essay must show that you have thought about the material yourselves and use your own
words to express your thoughts. The essay must be emailed to the instructor no later than one
week after the absence. The first two make-up essays can score up to 3 points – the same as
the missed quizzes. However, the third essay can only score up to 2 points, the fourth essay
up to 1 point only. If you miss more than 4 quizzes, there is no way to make up for them by
writing additional essays.
Academic integrity: You must complete all in-class quizzes yourself. You are not allowed to
disclose any quiz questions to any student who has not yet taken the respective quiz. Soliciting
or disclosing any quiz-related information is a serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct
(studentconduct.osu.edu).
CARMEN QUIZZES
Description: In addition to the quiz done on paper in class, there is also a Carmen quiz
associated with each lecture. This gives you an opportunity to review what you have learned in
class and to score additional points. Each Carmen quiz is worth up to 2 points and is based on
material from the latest lecture. These quizzes are open-book. A typical quiz contains 2 shortanswer questions. They are graded by the course assistant. The 4 lowest-scoring quizzes
will be dropped at the end of the semester, and the points from the remaining 20
quizzes will count towards your final grade. Thus, the maximum number of points that
can be earned from Carmen quizzes is 40 points.
Academic integrity: You must complete all Carmen quizzes yourself. Your answers must be
your own individual work, should reflect your unique thoughts, and be written in your own 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022
8
words and with a professional tone. Beware of plagiarism, including self-plagiarism. Soliciting
or disclosing any quiz-related information is a serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct
(studentconduct.osu.edu).
Extra credit
There will be a limited number of extra-credit opportunities. They will be described in an annex
to this Syllabus that will be distributed separately. Look for it on Carmen.
Instructor feedback and response time
You can call 614-688-HELP at any time if you have a technical problem.
The primary communication channel between students and the instructor and CA is via
Carmen. This includes Carmen announcements, modules, posts, and other items. For
confidential questions (e.g., related to disabilities), please contact Dr. Petrov by email at
petrov.11@osu.edu. Emails will be responded to promptly.
OTHER COURSE POLICIES
Official announcements
Official announcements will be made primarily through Carmen. The Syllabus is subject to
revision. If you are not in attendance when revision announcements are made, it is your
responsibility to find out about them by checking the Carmen site or asking classmates. Email
announcements may be sent to the class list or to individual students. These messages are
always addressed to your official OSU account (with the “dot number”). This is the only
account known to Carmen. Therefore, please make sure to check your official OSU
account regularly. Failure to check the official email account is not a valid excuse for missing
a requirement.
Copyright for instructional materials
The materials used in connection with this course may be subject to copyright protection and
are only for the use of students officially enrolled in the course for the educational purposes
associated with the course. Copyright law must be considered before copying, retaining, or
disseminating materials outside of the course.

Zoom/Videoconferencing Guidelines
Because of the COVID pandemic, some classes will have to be done remotely through
Zoom videoconferencing. Because this mode of insruction has benefits and challenges
that differ from in-person class sessions, I want to share my expectations for how we will
meet and communicate:
• Technical Issues: If you encounter a technical issue with Zoom during a session, first
make sure you are using the latest version of Zoom. Next, contact the IT Service Desk
at http://go.osu.edu/it or 614-688-4357(HELP). I will not be able to address technical
issues during a live session.
• Preparation: Come to the Zoom session having completed any readings or pre-work
and be ready to have open, civil, and supportive discussions in video and chat spaces. I
ask that you update your Zoom profile with your preferred name and add a picture with
your face.
• Participation: At the start of our sessions, I’ll share specific expectations for how to
use the chat, how to interact, and how to raise questions or concerns as we go. If
you are unsure about expectations or are unsure about raising a question, please
follow up with me afterward to make sure your questions are answered. Plan to be
present during the entire session as much as you are able. For some activities, I
may ask you to share your faces on camera so that we can see each other and
connect. Please feel encouraged to use a non-distracting virtual background. Many
students and instructors prefer not to share their remote spaces for a variety of
reasons. Mute your microphone when others are talking to minimize background
noise in the meeting.
• Recordings: I may be recording our meetings for the benefit of students who may need
to be absent. These links will only be shared with students in our class. Please do not
share any course materials or student contributions outside of this class without clear
written permission from the student(s) involved AND Dr. Petrov.
Academic integrity policy
See Descriptions of assessment categories above, for my specific guidelines about
collaboration and academic integrity in the context of this class.
OHIO STATE’S ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY
Academic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in
teaching, research, and other educational and scholarly activities. Thus, The Ohio State
University and the Committee on Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have
read and understand the university’s Code of Student Conduct (studentconduct.osu.edu), and
that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and
honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the rules and guidelines established in 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022
10
the university’s Code of Student Conduct and this syllabus may constitute “Academic
Misconduct.”
The Ohio State University’s Code of Student Conduct (Section 3335-23-04) defines academic
misconduct as: “Any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the university
or subvert the educational process.” Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not
limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized collaboration), copying the work of another
student, and possession of unauthorized materials during an examination. Ignorance of the
university’s Code of Student Conduct is never considered an excuse for academic misconduct,
so I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and, specifically, the sections
dealing with academic misconduct.
If I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this course, I am
obligated by university rules to report my suspicions to the Committee on Academic
Misconduct. If you have any questions about the above policy or what constitutes academic
misconduct in this course, please contact me.
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or
establish procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic
misconduct. The term “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic
misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism
and dishonest practices in connection with examinations. Instructors shall report all
instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487).
For additional information, see the Code of Student
Conduct http://studentlife.osu.edu/csc/.
Other sources of information on academic misconduct (integrity) to which you can refer
include:
• Committee on Academic Misconduct web page (go.osu.edu/coam)
• Ten Suggestions for Preserving Academic Integrity (go.osu.edu/ten-suggestions)
• Eight Cardinal Rules of Academic Integrity (go.osu.edu/cardinal-rules)
Grievances and solving problems
According to University Policies, if you have a problem with this class, you should seek to
resolve the grievance concerning a grade or academic practice by speaking first with the
instructor or professor. Then, if necessary, take your case to the department chairperson,
college dean or associate dean, and to the provost, in that order. Specific procedures are
outlined in Faculty Rule 3335-8-23. Grievances against graduate, research, and teaching
assistants should be submitted first to the supervising instructor, then to the chairperson of the
assistant's department.

Course description
This course surveys selected topics in modern cognitive psychology with an emphasis on
memory, categorization, thinking, and problem solving. It is intended for undergraduate
students with basic knowledge of psychology (prerequisite Psych 1100). Some questions we
will consider are: What is cognitive psychology and how does it fit into the broader framework
of cognitive science? What methods do scientists use to study memory and high-level 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022

cognition? What behavioral regularities characterize memory? What kinds of memory are
there? Where does memory reside in the brain? What are some important theories and models
of memory? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How does one evaluate a scientific
theory? Can memory research help us study and remember better? Are the testimonies of
honest eyewitnesses always reliable? How do people classify things into categories? How are
concepts represented and organized in semantic memory? Are humans fundamentally rational
or irrational? What tools allow us to construct, and to understand, a reasoned argument? What
tools allow us to recognize a fallacious or fraudulent argument? What is the distinction
between deductive and inductive reasoning? How do people solve problems? What is the role
of insight in problem solving? Can the creative process be studied scientifically and, if so,
how? How can fluid intelligence and creativity be measured? Can they be improved?

GRADING AND FACULTY RESPONSE
How your grade is calculated
See course schedule below for the dates of the multiple-choice tests.
Your official grade in this course will be determined on the basis of three in-class exams during
the semester, one final exam during Finals week, 24 in-class quizzes, and 24 Carmen quizzes.
The lowest score of the four tests will be dropped and the other three test scores count toward
your grade as detailed below. Analogously, the four lowest scores of each quiz category will be
dropped. The maximum number of points for the course is 400. Your total points will be
converted to a letter grade at the end of the semester according to the following brackets:
The instructor and course assistant make every effort to ensure that the grades are accurate,
fair, and consistent. Nobody is immune to mistakes, however. If you believe that your test
and/or quiz results are in error, please let us know no later than one week after the results are
announced. Such notifications must be made in writing and emailed to petrov.11@osu.edu.
We will review your complaint carefully and answer by email or invite you to a personal
meeting with Dr. Petrov to discuss the issue. Complaints about test results, quiz results, or

Psych 3312 Spring 2022

anything else that affects your grade will not be considered or discussed unless a
written statement was emailed to the instructor or course assistant in advance. There
are no exceptions to these rules.
Descriptions of assessment categories
As we will study during the course, people remember much better when they study on a
regular basis rather than cramming in the last few hours before an exam. The organization of
this course capitalizes on this property of memory. There are three in-class exams and multiple
quizzes throughout the semester. There is also a cumulative final exam during Finals week.
MULTIPLE-CHOICE TESTS
Description: All exams are closed-book multiple-choice tests. They are based on material
from the lectures, the textbook, the additional required readings, and on certain videos that are
clearly marked in the lecture slides and linked on Carmen. The three in-class exams are noncumulative, whereas the final exam covers the material from the entire semester. Each exam
is worth 100 points. Everyone can have a bad day. That is why your worst test score will be
dropped from the evaluation: only the three best scores of the four tests will count toward
your grade. The total number of points that can be earned for the exams is 300. Thus, if
you are happy with your scores on the in-class tests, you can skip the final. Missed exams will
be graded with zero points. Makeup exams will only be given in cases of documented
emergency or when prior approval has been given to miss the exam. For example, I will need
an official note from the doctor’s office if you were sick. If you are late for the test, you will be
allowed to take it, but you must submit your answer sheet by the closing time like everybody
else. Please bring a photo ID, a #2 pencil, and an eraser to the test room.
Academic integrity: You must complete all tests yourself. Because there have been cases of
students using their smart watches to cheat and because it is difficult to differentiate a smart
watch from an ordinary one, all electronic watches must be put in your bags for the
duration of all tests. Once the test begins, no questions about any test item are allowed.
Please do not leave your seat until you are ready to turn your answer sheet in. After you turn it
in, leave the test room immediately. You are not allowed to discuss any test question with any
student who has not yet taken the test. Soliciting or disclosing any test-content information is a
serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct (studentconduct.osu.edu).
IN-CLASS QUIZZES
Description: As we will study during the course, research has clearly shown that good
learning outcomes require a significant investment of time on the part of the student. Attending
the lectures is a good start but is not enough. According to Rule 3335-8-24 of the OSU Bylaws 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022
7
on Instruction (http://go.osu.edu/credithours), students should expect around 9 hours per week
for a 3-credit course such as ours. This amounts to 6 hours of home study on top of the 3
hours of classroom time. Please read the pages from the textbook (and/or other required
readings as specified by the instructor) associated with each lecture prior to coming to class.
The in-class quizzes are based on material from the readings and are designed to verify and
reward the work you have done at home. They are closed-book and are given at the beginning
of class for up to 10 minutes. Each quiz is worth 3 points and typically consists of 3 shortanswer questions about the previous lecture and the current lecture. The 4 lowest-scoring
quizzes will be dropped at the end of the semester, and the points from the remaining
20 quizzes will count towards your final grade. Thus, the maximum number of points
that can be earned from in-class quizzes is 60 points. Attendance is required in the sense
that if you miss too many lectures you will also miss the associated quiz points, which in turn
will make it difficult to accumulate enough points for a good grade. Missed in-class quizzes
cannot be taken at a later date but you can substitute a 500-word essay about some material
from the lecture you have missed. Note that it is a bad essay (which will not receive many
points) if it simply paraphrases sentences taken from the textbook or the required readings.
Your essay must show that you have thought about the material yourselves and use your own
words to express your thoughts. The essay must be emailed to the instructor no later than one
week after the absence. The first two make-up essays can score up to 3 points – the same as
the missed quizzes. However, the third essay can only score up to 2 points, the fourth essay
up to 1 point only. If you miss more than 4 quizzes, there is no way to make up for them by
writing additional essays.
Academic integrity: You must complete all in-class quizzes yourself. You are not allowed to
disclose any quiz questions to any student who has not yet taken the respective quiz. Soliciting
or disclosing any quiz-related information is a serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct
(studentconduct.osu.edu).
CARMEN QUIZZES
Description: In addition to the quiz done on paper in class, there is also a Carmen quiz
associated with each lecture. This gives you an opportunity to review what you have learned in
class and to score additional points. Each Carmen quiz is worth up to 2 points and is based on
material from the latest lecture. These quizzes are open-book. A typical quiz contains 2 shortanswer questions. They are graded by the course assistant. The 4 lowest-scoring quizzes
will be dropped at the end of the semester, and the points from the remaining 20
quizzes will count towards your final grade. Thus, the maximum number of points that
can be earned from Carmen quizzes is 40 points.
Academic integrity: You must complete all Carmen quizzes yourself. Your answers must be
your own individual work, should reflect your unique thoughts, and be written in your own 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022
8
words and with a professional tone. Beware of plagiarism, including self-plagiarism. Soliciting
or disclosing any quiz-related information is a serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct
(studentconduct.osu.edu).
Extra credit
There will be a limited number of extra-credit opportunities. They will be described in an annex
to this Syllabus that will be distributed separately. Look for it on Carmen.
Instructor feedback and response time
You can call 614-688-HELP at any time if you have a technical problem.
The primary communication channel between students and the instructor and CA is via
Carmen. This includes Carmen announcements, modules, posts, and other items. For
confidential questions (e.g., related to disabilities), please contact Dr. Petrov by email at
petrov.11@osu.edu. Emails will be responded to promptly.
OTHER COURSE POLICIES
Official announcements
Official announcements will be made primarily through Carmen. The Syllabus is subject to
revision. If you are not in attendance when revision announcements are made, it is your
responsibility to find out about them by checking the Carmen site or asking classmates. Email
announcements may be sent to the class list or to individual students. These messages are
always addressed to your official OSU account (with the “dot number”). This is the only
account known to Carmen. Therefore, please make sure to check your official OSU
account regularly. Failure to check the official email account is not a valid excuse for missing
a requirement.
Copyright for instructional materials
The materials used in connection with this course may be subject to copyright protection and
are only for the use of students officially enrolled in the course for the educational purposes
associated with the course. Copyright law must be considered before copying, retaining, or
disseminating materials outside of the course.

Zoom/Videoconferencing Guidelines
Because of the COVID pandemic, some classes will have to be done remotely through
Zoom videoconferencing. Because this mode of insruction has benefits and challenges
that differ from in-person class sessions, I want to share my expectations for how we will
meet and communicate:
• Technical Issues: If you encounter a technical issue with Zoom during a session, first
make sure you are using the latest version of Zoom. Next, contact the IT Service Desk
at http://go.osu.edu/it or 614-688-4357(HELP). I will not be able to address technical
issues during a live session.
• Preparation: Come to the Zoom session having completed any readings or pre-work
and be ready to have open, civil, and supportive discussions in video and chat spaces. I
ask that you update your Zoom profile with your preferred name and add a picture with
your face.
• Participation: At the start of our sessions, I’ll share specific expectations for how to
use the chat, how to interact, and how to raise questions or concerns as we go. If
you are unsure about expectations or are unsure about raising a question, please
follow up with me afterward to make sure your questions are answered. Plan to be
present during the entire session as much as you are able. For some activities, I
may ask you to share your faces on camera so that we can see each other and
connect. Please feel encouraged to use a non-distracting virtual background. Many
students and instructors prefer not to share their remote spaces for a variety of
reasons. Mute your microphone when others are talking to minimize background
noise in the meeting.
• Recordings: I may be recording our meetings for the benefit of students who may need
to be absent. These links will only be shared with students in our class. Please do not
share any course materials or student contributions outside of this class without clear
written permission from the student(s) involved AND Dr. Petrov.
Academic integrity policy
See Descriptions of assessment categories above, for my specific guidelines about
collaboration and academic integrity in the context of this class.
OHIO STATE’S ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY
Academic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in
teaching, research, and other educational and scholarly activities. Thus, The Ohio State
University and the Committee on Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have
read and understand the university’s Code of Student Conduct (studentconduct.osu.edu), and
that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and
honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the rules and guidelines established in 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022
10
the university’s Code of Student Conduct and this syllabus may constitute “Academic
Misconduct.”
The Ohio State University’s Code of Student Conduct (Section 3335-23-04) defines academic
misconduct as: “Any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the university
or subvert the educational process.” Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not
limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized collaboration), copying the work of another
student, and possession of unauthorized materials during an examination. Ignorance of the
university’s Code of Student Conduct is never considered an excuse for academic misconduct,
so I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and, specifically, the sections
dealing with academic misconduct.
If I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this course, I am
obligated by university rules to report my suspicions to the Committee on Academic
Misconduct. If you have any questions about the above policy or what constitutes academic
misconduct in this course, please contact me.
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or
establish procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic
misconduct. The term “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic
misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism
and dishonest practices in connection with examinations. Instructors shall report all
instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487).
For additional information, see the Code of Student
Conduct http://studentlife.osu.edu/csc/.
Other sources of information on academic misconduct (integrity) to which you can refer
include:
• Committee on Academic Misconduct web page (go.osu.edu/coam)
• Ten Suggestions for Preserving Academic Integrity (go.osu.edu/ten-suggestions)
• Eight Cardinal Rules of Academic Integrity (go.osu.edu/cardinal-rules)
Grievances and solving problems
According to University Policies, if you have a problem with this class, you should seek to
resolve the grievance concerning a grade or academic practice by speaking first with the
instructor or professor. Then, if necessary, take your case to the department chairperson,
college dean or associate dean, and to the provost, in that order. Specific procedures are
outlined in Faculty Rule 3335-8-23. Grievances against graduate, research, and teaching
assistants should be submitted first to the supervising instructor, then to the chairperson of the
assistant's department.

cognition? What behavioral regularities characterize memory? What kinds of memory are
there? Where does memory reside in the brain? What are some important theories and models
of memory? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How does one evaluate a scientific
theory? Can memory research help us study and remember better? Are the testimonies of
honest eyewitnesses always reliable? How do people classify things into categories? How are
concepts represented and organized in semantic memory? Are humans fundamentally rational
or irrational? What tools allow us to construct, and to understand, a reasoned argument? What

GRADING AND FACULTY RESPONSE
How your grade is calculated
See course schedule below for the dates of the multiple-choice tests.
Your official grade in this course will be determined on the basis of three in-class exams during
the semester, one final exam during Finals week, 24 in-class quizzes, and 24 Carmen quizzes.
The lowest score of the four tests will be dropped and the other three test scores count toward
your grade as detailed below. Analogously, the four lowest scores of each quiz category will be
dropped. The maximum number of points for the course is 400. Your total points will be
converted to a letter grade at the end of the semester according to the following brackets:
The instructor and course assistant make every effort to ensure that the grades are accurate,
fair, and consistent. Nobody is immune to mistakes, however. If you believe that your test
and/or quiz results are in error, please let us know no later than one week after the results are
announced. Such notifications must be made in writing and emailed to
We will review your complaint carefully and answer by email or invite you to a personal
meeting with Dr. Petrov to discuss the issue. Complaints about test results, quiz results, or

Psych 3312 Spring 2022

anything else that affects your grade will not be considered or discussed unless a
written statement was emailed to the instructor or course assistant in advance. There
are no exceptions to these rules.
Descriptions of assessment categories
As we will study during the course, people remember much better when they study on a
regular basis rather than cramming in the last few hours before an exam. The organization of
this course capitalizes on this property of memory. There are three in-class exams and multiple
quizzes throughout the semester. There is also a cumulative final exam during Finals week.
MULTIPLE-CHOICE TESTS
Description: All exams are closed-book multiple-choice tests. They are based on material
from the lectures, the textbook, the additional required readings, and on certain videos that are
clearly marked in the lecture slides and linked on Carmen. The three in-class exams are noncumulative, whereas the final exam covers the material from the entire semester. Each exam
is worth 100 points. Everyone can have a bad day. That is why your worst test score will be
dropped from the evaluation: only the three best scores of the four tests will count toward
your grade. The total number of points that can be earned for the exams is 300. Thus, if
you are happy with your scores on the in-class tests, you can skip the final. Missed exams will
be graded with zero points. Makeup exams will only be given in cases of documented
emergency or when prior approval has been given to miss the exam. For example, I will need
an official note from the doctor’s office if you were sick. If you are late for the test, you will be
allowed to take it, but you must submit your answer sheet by the closing time like everybody
else. Please bring a photo ID, a #2 pencil, and an eraser to the test room.
Academic integrity: You must complete all tests yourself. Because there have been cases of
students using their smart watches to cheat and because it is difficult to differentiate a smart
watch from an ordinary one, all electronic watches must be put in your bags for the
duration of all tests. Once the test begins, no questions about any test item are allowed.
Please do not leave your seat until you are ready to turn your answer sheet in. After you turn it
in, leave the test room immediately. You are not allowed to discuss any test question with any
student who has not yet taken the test. Soliciting or disclosing any test-content information is a
serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct (studentconduct.osu.edu).
IN-CLASS QUIZZES
Description: As we will study during the course, research has clearly shown that good
learning outcomes require a significant investment of time on the part of the student. Attending
the lectures is a good start but is not enough. According to Rule 3335-8-24 of the OSU Bylaws 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022
7
on Instruction  students should expect around 9 hours per week
for a 3-credit course such as ours. This amounts to 6 hours of home study on top of the 3
hours of classroom time. Please read the pages from the textbook (and/or other required
readings as specified by the instructor) associated with each lecture prior to coming to class.
The in-class quizzes are based on material from the readings and are designed to verify and
reward the work you have done at home. They are closed-book and are given at the beginning
of class for up to 10 minutes. Each quiz is worth 3 points and typically consists of 3 shortanswer questions about the previous lecture and the current lecture. The 4 lowest-scoring
quizzes will be dropped at the end of the semester, and the points from the remaining
20 quizzes will count towards your final grade. Thus, the maximum number of points
that can be earned from in-class quizzes is 60 points. Attendance is required in the sense
that if you miss too many lectures you will also miss the associated quiz points, which in turn
will make it difficult to accumulate enough points for a good grade. Missed in-class quizzes
cannot be taken at a later date but you can substitute a 500-word essay about some material
from the lecture you have missed. Note that it is a bad essay (which will not receive many
points) if it simply paraphrases sentences taken from the textbook or the required readings.
Your essay must show that you have thought about the material yourselves and use your own
words to express your thoughts. The essay must be emailed to the instructor no later than one
week after the absence. The first two make-up essays can score up to 3 points – the same as
the missed quizzes. However, the third essay can only score up to 2 points, the fourth essay
up to 1 point only. If you miss more than 4 quizzes, there is no way to make up for them by
writing additional essays.
Academic integrity: You must complete all in-class quizzes yourself. You are not allowed to
disclose any quiz questions to any student who has not yet taken the respective quiz. Soliciting
or disclosing any quiz-related information is a serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct
CARMEN QUIZZES
Description: In addition to the quiz done on paper in class, there is also a Carmen quiz
associated with each lecture. This gives you an opportunity to review what you have learned in
class and to score additional points. Each Carmen quiz is worth up to 2 points and is based on
material from the latest lecture. These quizzes are open-book. A typical quiz contains 2 shortanswer questions. They are graded by the course assistant. The 4 lowest-scoring quizzes
will be dropped at the end of the semester, and the points from the remaining 20
quizzes will count towards your final grade. Thus, the maximum number of points that
can be earned from Carmen quizzes is 40 points.
Academic integrity: You must complete all Carmen quizzes yourself. Your answers must be
your own individual work, should reflect your unique thoughts, and be written in your own 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022
8
words and with a professional tone. Beware of plagiarism, including self-plagiarism. Soliciting
or disclosing any quiz-related information is a serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct
Extra credit
There will be a limited number of extra-credit opportunities. They will be described in an annex
to this Syllabus that will be distributed separately. Look for it on Carmen.
Instructor feedback and response time
You can call 614-688-HELP at any time if you have a technical problem.
The primary communication channel between students and the instructor and CA is via
Carmen. This includes Carmen announcements, modules, posts, and other items. For
confidential questions (e.g., related to disabilities), . Emails will be responded to promptly.
OTHER COURSE POLICIES
Official announcements
Official announcements will be made primarily through Carmen. The Syllabus is subject to
revision. If you are not in attendance when revision announcements are made, it is your
responsibility to find out about them by checking the Carmen site or asking classmates. Email
announcements may be sent to the class list or to individual students. These messages are
always addressed to your official OSU account (with the “dot number”). This is the only
account known to Carmen. Therefore, please make sure to check your official OSU
account regularly. Failure to check the official email account is not a valid excuse for missing
a requirement.
Copyright for instructional materials
The materials used in connection with this course may be subject to copyright protection and
are only for the use of students officially enrolled in the course for the educational purposes
associated with the course. Copyright law must be considered before copying, retaining, or
disseminating materials outside of the course.

Zoom/Videoconferencing Guidelines
Because of the COVID pandemic, some classes will have to be done remotely through
Zoom videoconferencing. Because this mode of insruction has benefits and challenges
that differ from in-person class sessions, I want to share my expectations for how we will
meet and communicate:
• Technical Issues: If you encounter a technical issue with Zoom during a session, first
make sure you are using the latest version of Zoom. Next, contact the IT Service Desk
at . I will not be able to address technical
issues during a live session.
• Preparation: Come to the Zoom session having completed any readings or pre-work
and be ready to have open, civil, and supportive discussions in video and chat spaces. I
ask that you update your Zoom profile with your preferred name and add a picture with
your face.
• Participation: At the start of our sessions, I’ll share specific expectations for how to
use the chat, how to interact, and how to raise questions or concerns as we go. If
you are unsure about expectations or are unsure about raising a question, please
follow up with me afterward to make sure your questions are answered. Plan to be
present during the entire session as much as you are able. For some activities, I
may ask you to share your faces on camera so that we can see each other and
connect. Please feel encouraged to use a non-distracting virtual background. Many
students and instructors prefer not to share their remote spaces for a variety of
reasons. Mute your microphone when others are talking to minimize background
noise in the meeting.
• Recordings: I may be recording our meetings for the benefit of students who may need
to be absent. These links will only be shared with students in our class. Please do not
share any course materials or student contributions outside of this class without clear
written permission from the student(s) involved AND 
Academic integrity policy
See Descriptions of assessment categories above, for my specific guidelines about
collaboration and academic integrity in the context of this class.
OHIO STATE’S ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY
Academic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in
teaching, research, and other educational and scholarly activities. Thus, The Ohio State
University and the Committee on Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have
read and understand the university’s Code of Student Conduct  and
that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and
honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the rules and guidelines established in 
Psych 3312 Spring 2022
10
the university’s Code of Student Conduct and this syllabus may constitute “Academic
Misconduct.”
The Ohio State University’s Code of Student Conduct (Section 3335-23-04) defines academic
misconduct as: “Any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the university
or subvert the educational process.” Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not
limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized collaboration), copying the work of another
student, and possession of unauthorized materials during an examination. Ignorance of the
university’s Code of Student Conduct is never considered an excuse for academic misconduct,
so I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and, specifically, the sections
dealing with academic misconduct.
If I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this course, I am
obligated by university rules to report my suspicions to the Committee on Academic
Misconduct. If you have any questions about the above policy or what constitutes academic
misconduct in this course, please contact me.
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or
establish procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic
misconduct. The term “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic
misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism
and dishonest practices in connection with examinations. Instructors shall report all
instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487).
For additional information, see the Code of Student
Conduct 
Other sources of information on academic misconduct (integrity) to which you can refer
include:
• Committee on Academic Misconduct web page • Ten Suggestions for Preserving Academic Integrity 
• Eight Cardinal Rules of Academic Integrity 
Grievances and solving problems
According to University Policies, if you have a problem with this class, you should seek to
resolve the grievance concerning a grade or academic practice by speaking first with the
instructor or professor. Then, if necessary, take your case to the department chairperson,
college dean or associate dean, and to the provost, in that order. Specific procedures are
outlined in Faculty Rule 3335-8-23. Grievances against graduate, research, and teaching
assistants should be submitted first to the supervising instructor, then to the chairperson of the
assistant's department.

COURSE INSTRUCTIONAL POLICIES
Organization and Conduct of Class
This class will meet on Tuesday and Thursday mornings for approximately 80 minutes to review the
assignments, concepts and materials. My assumption is that you will have already read the text and will
be coming to class prepared to discuss your thoughts and/or position on the material. Note that lectures
and presentations are a supplement to the readings rather than a rehash of what you’ve already seen.
The real value of the course will come from our interactions and discussions on concepts and real-world
examples. Accordingly, it is necessary for you to plan to attend class on a regular basis to keep up to
speed. Attendance will be monitored and will count as an element of your final grade.
OSU e-mail
Both OSU and I will use your OSU email address for all official communications. It is vital that you
access your OSU email on a regular basis to ensure that you will not miss any critical communications
for which you will be held accountable. If you need help with the management of your email account,
please contact the OSU IT Service Desk at (614) 688-4357.
Academic Integrity
All policies on academic honesty will be strictly enforced. Along with preparing for and attending
classes, each student has the responsibility of promoting high academic standards. Academic dishonesty
includes: (a) cheating; (b) fabrications and falsifications; (c) multiple submissions; (d) plagiarism; and
(e) complicity in academic dishonesty. Proven cases of dishonesty may result in a grade of ""F"" in the
course and will be referred for University disciplinary action consistent with the Student Code of
Conduct.
Disability Services Statement
Students with a documented disability who wish to request reasonable accommodations should contact
the Student Life Disability Services Office first to request accommodations, and then meet with their
instructors. Accommodation arrangements should be made during the first two weeks of the semester.
Students may request accommodations at any time during the semester, but please note:
accommodations are not retroactive. Students must contact the Student Life Disability Services Office
prior to every semester that accommodations are needed. The Student Life Disability Services Office is
located in in 098 Baker Hall, 113 West 12th Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43210. Their telephone number is
(614) 292-3307, and their email is slds@osu.edu . The Ohio State University and its faculty are
committed to helping you meet your individual needs, and to supporting your efforts for a quality
education.

Mental Health Services Statement
As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning. These can include
things such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol or drug-related problems, feeling down,
difficulty concentrating, and/or a lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
3
lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in normal daily
activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns
you may be experiencing.
If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, you can learn more
about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the Office of Student
Life’s Counseling and Consultation Service (CCS). You can contact them at ccs.osu.edu, or by calling
(614) 292-5766. CCS offices are located on the 4th Floor of the Younkin Success Center, and the 10th Floor
of Lincoln Tower. You can also reach an on-call counselor when CCS is closed by calling (614) 292-5766.
24-hour emergency help is also available through the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-
TALK, or at www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org.
Dennis Learning Center Support
The Dennis Learning Center’s goal is to help support and improve the academic success of Ohio State
students through academic coaching, group workshops, and elective courses. We offer free, one-hour
appointments in which you can discuss various topics (note-taking, procrastination, test anxiety, exam
preparation, time-management, etc.) with an academic coach and create a plan for success. The DLC is
located on the 2nd floor of the Younkin Success Center. Visit our
website https://dennislearningcenter.osu.edu to learn more.
Guidelines for Project Teams
 Each team project for this course should represent a culmination of the efforts of each
individual member of the project team. No one person should be held responsible for the
work assigned.
 All team assignments should reflect the total collaboration and participation of its individual
members.
 Each member’s total participation becomes the responsibility of the entire team and will be
reflected in the final grades.
 You will participate in a process of collectively determining performance expectations for
each other and for the team as a whole. You will subsequently be assessed by teammates as
to the quality and consistency of your contributions and your record of meeting team
expectations.
Dropping the Course
University policies will be followed. Please consult with your academic advisor for exact dates for
dropping a course without penalty.
Submissions of Assignments
All written work will be submitted to turnitin.com in an electronic format. No assignments will be
accepted in any form other than electronic submission to the Drop Box. All work must meet
requirements for APA documentation format and minimum length requirements. If a submission is
4
deficient on either of these measures, it will not be accepted and will be considered late. No work will be
accepted via email unless previously approved by the instructor. If you are submitting work late, bring it
with you to the next class. All late submissions will incur a minimum 20% deduction from the total
available points for that assignment. No submissions will be accepted after one week from the due date
without prior approval from the instructor.
Instructor Expectations
The classroom will be the place for interaction, discussion, demonstration, exploration and mastery of
the concepts presented and discussed. Each of you brings an element of diversity to the classroom that
can help to maximize the learning potential of all students, if we capitalize on this diversity. A few
expectations for helping us to achieve this would include:
 -- Preparation: Come to class with an understanding of the main points presented in the
notes, and be sure that you have read all assigned materials. Also, strive to bring new
information to the discussion, things that you have found or personally experienced.
 -- Attendance: I expect full attendance at all the class sessions.
 -- Involvement: In class, I expect that you will be fully engaged and participate
enthusiastically in all class discussions.
 -- Reflection: Your course readings, films, classroom exercises, and discussions should challenge some
of your perceptions of leadership and human behavior in a community. It will be helpful for you to write
your reactions down as you note them so that can refer back to them at a later date.
Campus Emergency
In the unusual event of a major campus emergency, course requirements,
deadlines and grading
percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a revised
semester calendar or other
circumstances. To get information about changes in this course visit the course
home page, contact me by email at taylor.821@osu.edu or call me at (614) 858-
9280.
 A Final Word About Classroom Etiquette
Respect for the pursuit of truth requires that we behave in ways that contribute to the collegial spirit:
punctuality, preparation, reading the assignments ahead of class in order to be prepared for enthusiastic
participation in discussions, careful study, academic honesty, politeness in arguments that may arise out
of differing points of view, the use of our best critical thinking skills, and meeting deadlines, all facilitate
this effort. Since we believe that something special goes on in the classroom, we are also expected to
pay attention to what the instructor and our colleagues say, and to refrain from becoming a distraction to
others. In this spirit, cell phones are to be turned off when you come into the classroom, unless you have
a specific need to be contacted, and have obtained prior approval from the instructor. No iPod’s, MP3
Players, video games, or other electronic devices are to be turned on during the class period.

 Purpose of the assigned paper is to provide students with the opportunity to apply teachings and
learnings from the first 3 weeks of the course to a “real world” company. Students should select
their preferred company by the second week of the course and identify their choice in the
appropriate discussion board on Canvas. Students should then address the 7 questions/concepts
listed below in a written paper of no more than 6 pages.
 Select a retailer of your choosing based on the following criteria: (1) company must be a
publically traded company with revenues in excess of $500 million USD, (2) company must
operate stores, and (3) company must operate in a least two retail channels.

and its performance relative to the primary competitor from question #2?
7) What type of retail locations does your company operate in and why does the retailer chose to operate
in these locations?
On an additional (7th) page, students should provide a chart comparing the following key financial
metrics for the most recent year that fiscal details are available. Provide details for your company as
well as their chief competitor.
 Net Sales ($)
 Gross Margin ($)
 Gross Margin %

Students are encouraged to visit their chosen company’s store locations as well as competitor stores.
Students are also encouraged to read their company’s latest Annual Report and 10k to understand the
retailer more in-depth. Students are also encouraged to use onsite and remote resources of the OSU’s
libraries (http://library.osu.edu). These resources as well as the required course text should provide you

this course, we will be reviewing case studies, critical thinking exercises, and
learning objective reviews. Each of your project teams will be assigned as a leader
for one of the scheduled discussions. Your responsibilities will include the
following:

the issue at hand.
 Lead the class discussion on the facts and how your team came to your
conclusions.
 Identify and discuss alternate positions from others in the class.
 Provide specific recommendations to be implemented based on your
position.
 Teams can present in any format. That means that you can all lead the
discussion, or you can assign one person to spearhead your efforts.
 Discussions are to take no more than 15 minutes.
Leading the class discussions will be worth a total of 50 points for each team
member. Score will be awarded according to the following rubric:

Executive Review Committee (50 Total Points)
As each team takes their turn leading the case discussion outlined above, one of
the other teams will be assigned as the Executive Review Committee. The ERC will
have the responsibility of reviewing the case and any notes provided by the
presenting team in advance of the presentation. Once the team has finished
presenting their facts and recommendations, the ERC will have the responsibility to
demonstrate their knowledge and critical thinking on the case by asking relevant
and/or value-added questions to the presenting team. Presenting teams must
turn their data over to the ERC no later than 48 hours prior to the
presentation. Please note that this isn’t an opportunity to try and trip up anyone
else in the class, it is merely an opportunity for students to gain experience asking
the right questions, in the right manner, and at the right time.
Class Participation (100 Total Points)
Student scores for class participation will come from three specific areas: class
attendance, class engagement and participation, and engagement in the weekly
discussion topics and other uses of the course BB. Students are expected to
come to each class fully prepared to discuss their individual assignments
as well as any other work indicated in the weekly planning guide for this
course. Additionally, each student is expected to be an active participant in his or
her respective project teams. All students will have the responsibility to provide
feedback on the contributions of their teammates at the end of the course.
Examples of the expectations for each of these areas are also included on the
course homepage on Canvas. Note that attendance, while optional, will count
toward your final grade. Please be sure to read the guidelines for class
participation that are posted on Canvas in the Discussion Boards.
TEAM PROJECT – PROJECTING THE FUTURE FOR YOUR TARGET
RETAIL COMPANY
PROJECT OVERVIEW
The purpose of this team project is to build on the work already completed for
week five, and give the students an opportunity to demonstrate their mastery of
10
the basic concepts from the course. Students will continue to work in the same
teams as before. This time you will demonstrate your mastery of the course
concepts, the external market trends, and the issues faced by your target retailers.
Your teams will think critically about the current status and influences, and then
develop and articulate specific projections for your target company. You will
develop a written proposal as well as a formal presentation on how you see the
future unfolding for your retailer. Will they stay on the same track, will they be in
business, what will be different, what changes will be needed to remain relevant in
the retail environment of 2025. Be sure to consider the impact of demographics,
technology, legal and regulatory implications, and pricing and profit structures.
There is no right or wrong answer for any of the teams. I’m more interested in how
you develop your positioning by critical thinking and synthesis than I am in the
viability of your position. Be creative!
Guidelines for this project will be as follows:
 In the first two weeks of the course, all students will be randomly assigned to
a Project Group. Final group size will depend on the total enrollment for the
course.
 Each group will then select their target retailer to be used for all team
elements of the group projects.
Once your teams have been assigned and you have become familiar with each
other, you will then be expected to do the following:
 Meet as a team and develop a working agreement for how the assignment is
to be addressed, specific responsibilities for each member, and expectations
for performance.
 Select a target retailer.
 Complete the work required to deliver the report for week 5.
 Assess the current trends / issues / opportunities / implications that surround
your target retailer’s business model.
 Think critically on how all these elements will work together over the next
few years.
 Articulate a recommendation for what the future holds for your retailer.
 Identify what they will need to do to remain relevant in the future market.
 Define your specific growth strategy.
 Develop a Marketing Plan Recommendation Presentation to be
delivered in the final classes of the semester. Guidelines for this also appear
later in this document.
A note about your groups.
 The group is to work together to complete this project.
 All members of the group will receive the same grade for both the written
element as well as the formal presentation.
 Groups are free to divide up the work in any manner they deem appropriate.
 Each team member will provide a formal team evaluation on the
participation of the members. These will be due on the day that your group
presents to the class.
11
 I will make every effort to give your teams time at the end of class periods to
meet and catch up on planning and/or address any issues. You should also
plan to meet outside of class time to complete this assignment.
Team Project - Final In-Class Presentation (100 points)
Once all research and development work has been completed, all groups will
prepare a presentation for the class to be delivered in the final weeks of the class.
Group presentations guidelines will be as follows:
 Format for presentations (slides / presenters) will be at the discretion of each
group.
 Presentations are to be 12-15 minutes, no longer.
 Groups should be prepared to address questions from the class and/or the
facilitator.
 Final copy of the digital file is to be turned in on the day each group presents.
 Presentation materials should include at a minimum:
o Introduction of team members
o Overview of the key project details
 Retailer selected / rationale
 Summary of the factors from week 5 and strategic opportunities
o Specific market opportunity recommended
 What does the future hold for your retailer?

COURSE INSTRUCTIONAL POLICIES
Organization and Conduct of Class
This class will meet on Tuesday and Thursday mornings for approximately 80 minutes to review the
assignments, concepts and materials. My assumption is that you will have already read the text and will
be coming to class prepared to discuss your thoughts and/or position on the material. Note that lectures
and presentations are a supplement to the readings rather than a rehash of what you’ve already seen.
The real value of the course will come from our interactions and discussions on concepts and real-world
examples. Accordingly, it is necessary for you to plan to attend class on a regular basis to keep up to
speed. Attendance will be monitored and will count as an element of your final grade.
OSU e-mail
Both OSU and I will use your OSU email address for all official communications. It is vital that you
access your OSU email on a regular basis to ensure that you will not miss any critical communications
for which you will be held accountable. If you need help with the management of your email account,
please contact the OSU IT Service Desk at (614) 688-4357.
Academic Integrity
All policies on academic honesty will be strictly enforced. Along with preparing for and attending
classes, each student has the responsibility of promoting high academic standards. Academic dishonesty
includes: (a) cheating; (b) fabrications and falsifications; (c) multiple submissions; (d) plagiarism; and
(e) complicity in academic dishonesty. Proven cases of dishonesty may result in a grade of ""F"" in the
course and will be referred for University disciplinary action consistent with the Student Code of
Conduct.
Disability Services Statement
Students with a documented disability who wish to request reasonable accommodations should contact
the Student Life Disability Services Office first to request accommodations, and then meet with their
instructors. Accommodation arrangements should be made during the first two weeks of the semester.
Students may request accommodations at any time during the semester, but please note:
accommodations are not retroactive. Students must contact the Student Life Disability Services Office
prior to every semester that accommodations are needed, and their email is. The Ohio State University and its faculty are
committed to helping you meet your individual needs, and to supporting your efforts for a quality
education.

Mental Health Services Statement
As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning. These can include
things such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol or drug-related problems, feeling down,
difficulty concentrating, and/or a lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
3
lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in normal daily
activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns
you may be experiencing.
If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, you can learn more
about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the Office of Student
Life’s Counseling and Consultation Service (CCS). You can contact them at ccs.osu.edu, or by calling
(614) 292-5766. CCS offices are located on the 4th Floor of the Younkin Success Center, and the 10th Floor
of Lincoln Tower. You can also reach an on-call counselor when CCS is closed by calling (614) 292-5766.
24-hour emergency help is also available through the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-
TALK, or at.
Dennis Learning Center Support
The Dennis Learning Center’s goal is to help support and improve the academic success of Ohio State
students through academic coaching, group workshops, and elective courses. We offer free, one-hour
appointments in which you can discuss various topics (note-taking, procrastination, test anxiety, exam
preparation, time-management, etc.) with an academic coach and create a plan for success. The DLC is
located on the 2nd floor of the Younkin Success Center. Visit our
website to learn more.
Guidelines for Project Teams
 Each team project for this course should represent a culmination of the efforts of each
individual member of the project team. No one person should be held responsible for the
work assigned.
 All team assignments should reflect the total collaboration and participation of its individual
members.
 Each member’s total participation becomes the responsibility of the entire team and will be
reflected in the final grades.
 You will participate in a process of collectively determining performance expectations for
each other and for the team as a whole. You will subsequently be assessed by teammates as
to the quality and consistency of your contributions and your record of meeting team
expectations.
Dropping the Course
University policies will be followed. Please consult with your academic advisor for exact dates for
dropping a course without penalty.
Submissions of Assignments
All written work will be submitted to turnitin.com in an electronic format. No assignments will be
accepted in any form other than electronic submission to the Drop Box. All work must meet
requirements for APA documentation format and minimum length requirements. If a submission is
4
deficient on either of these measures, it will not be accepted and will be considered late. No work will be
accepted via email unless previously approved by the instructor. If you are submitting work late, bring it
with you to the next class. All late submissions will incur a minimum 20% deduction from the total
available points for that assignment. No submissions will be accepted after one week from the due date
without prior approval from the instructor.
Instructor Expectations
The classroom will be the place for interaction, discussion, demonstration, exploration and mastery of
the concepts presented and discussed. Each of you brings an element of diversity to the classroom that
can help to maximize the learning potential of all students, if we capitalize on this diversity. A few
expectations for helping us to achieve this would include:
 -- Preparation: Come to class with an understanding of the main points presented in the
notes, and be sure that you have read all assigned materials. Also, strive to bring new
information to the discussion, things that you have found or personally experienced.
 -- Attendance: I expect full attendance at all the class sessions.
 -- Involvement: In class, I expect that you will be fully engaged and participate
enthusiastically in all class discussions.
 -- Reflection: Your course readings, films, classroom exercises, and discussions should challenge some
of your perceptions of leadership and human behavior in a community. It will be helpful for you to write
your reactions down as you note them so that can refer back to them at a later date.
Campus Emergency
In the unusual event of a major campus emergency, course requirements,
deadlines and grading
percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a revised
semester calendar or other
circumstances. 
 A Final Word About Classroom Etiquette
Respect for the pursuit of truth requires that we behave in ways that contribute to the collegial spirit:
punctuality, preparation, reading the assignments ahead of class in order to be prepared for enthusiastic
participation in discussions, careful study, academic honesty, politeness in arguments that may arise out
of differing points of view, the use of our best critical thinking skills, and meeting deadlines, all facilitate
this effort. Since we believe that something special goes on in the classroom, we are also expected to
pay attention to what the instructor and our colleagues say, and to refrain from becoming a distraction to
others. In this spirit, cell phones are to be turned off when you come into the classroom, unless you have
a specific need to be contacted, and have obtained prior approval from the instructor. No iPod’s, MP3
Players, video games, or other electronic devices are to be turned on during the class period.

learnings from the first 3 weeks of the course to a “real world” company. Students should select
their preferred company by the second week of the course and identify their choice in the
appropriate discussion board on Canvas. Students should then address the 7 questions/concepts
listed below in a written paper of no more than 6 pages.
 Select a retailer of your choosing based on the following criteria: (1) company must be a
publically traded company with revenues in excess of $500 million USD, (2) company must

in these locations?
On an additional (7th) page, students should provide a chart comparing the following key financial
metrics for the most recent year that fiscal details are available. Provide details for your company as
well as their chief competitor.

Students are also encouraged to read their company’s latest Annual Report and 10k to understand the
retailer more in-depth. Students are also encouraged to use onsite and remote resources of the OSU’s

learning objective reviews. Each of your project teams will be assigned as a leader
for one of the scheduled discussions. Your responsibilities will include the

the other teams will be assigned as the Executive Review Committee. The ERC will
have the responsibility of reviewing the case and any notes provided by the
presenting team in advance of the presentation. Once the team has finished
presenting their facts and recommendations, the ERC will have the responsibility to
demonstrate their knowledge and critical thinking on the case by asking relevant
and/or value-added questions to the presenting team. Presenting teams must
turn their data over to the ERC no later than 48 hours prior to the
presentation. Please note that this isn’t an opportunity to try and trip up anyone
else in the class, it is merely an opportunity for students to gain experience asking
the right questions, in the right manner, and at the right time.
Class Participation (100 Total Points)
Student scores for class participation will come from three specific areas: class
attendance, class engagement and participation, and engagement in the weekly
discussion topics and other uses of the course BB. Students are expected to
come to each class fully prepared to discuss their individual assignments
as well as any other work indicated in the weekly planning guide for this
course. Additionally, each student is expected to be an active participant in his or
her respective project teams. All students will have the responsibility to provide
feedback on the contributions of their teammates at the end of the course.
Examples of the expectations for each of these areas are also included on the
course homepage on Canvas. Note that attendance, while optional, will count
toward your final grade. Please be sure to read the guidelines for class
participation that are posted on Canvas in the Discussion Boards.
TEAM PROJECT – PROJECTING THE FUTURE FOR YOUR TARGET
RETAIL COMPANY
PROJECT OVERVIEW
The purpose of this team project is to build on the work already completed for
week five, and give the students an opportunity to demonstrate their mastery of
10
the basic concepts from the course. Students will continue to work in the same
teams as before. This time you will demonstrate your mastery of the course
concepts, the external market trends, and the issues faced by your target retailers.
Your teams will think critically about the current status and influences, and then
develop and articulate specific projections for your target company. You will
develop a written proposal as well as a formal presentation on how you see the
future unfolding for your retailer. Will they stay on the same track, will they be in
business, what will be different, what changes will be needed to remain relevant in
the retail environment of 2025. Be sure to consider the impact of demographics,
technology, legal and regulatory implications, and pricing and profit structures.
There is no right or wrong answer for any of the teams. I’m more interested in how
you develop your positioning by critical thinking and synthesis than I am in the
viability of your position. Be creative!
Guidelines for this project will be as follows:
 In the first two weeks of the course, all students will be randomly assigned to
a Project Group. Final group size will depend on the total enrollment for the
course.
 Each group will then select their target retailer to be used for all team
elements of the group projects.
Once your teams have been assigned and you have become familiar with each
other, you will then be expected to do the following:
 Meet as a team and develop a working agreement for how the assignment is
to be addressed, specific responsibilities for each member, and expectations
for performance.
 Select a target retailer.
 Complete the work required to deliver the report for week 5.
 Assess the current trends / issues / opportunities / implications that surround
your target retailer’s business model.
 Think critically on how all these elements will work together over the next
few years.
 Articulate a recommendation for what the future holds for your retailer.
 Identify what they will need to do to remain relevant in the future market.
 Define your specific growth strategy.
 Develop a Marketing Plan Recommendation Presentation to be
delivered in the final classes of the semester. Guidelines for this also appear
later in this document.
A note about your groups.
 The group is to work together to complete this project.
 All members of the group will receive the same grade for both the written
element as well as the formal presentation.
 Groups are free to divide up the work in any manner they deem appropriate.
 Each team member will provide a formal team evaluation on the
participation of the members. These will be due on the day that your group
presents to the class.
11
 I will make every effort to give your teams time at the end of class periods to
meet and catch up on planning and/or address any issues. You should also
plan to meet outside of class time to complete this assignment.
Team Project - Final In-Class Presentation (100 points)
Once all research and development work has been completed, all groups will
prepare a presentation for the class to be delivered in the final weeks of the class.
Group presentations guidelines will be as follows:
 Format for presentations (slides / presenters) will be at the discretion of each
group.
 Presentations are to be 12-15 minutes, no longer.
 Groups should be prepared to address questions from the class and/or the
facilitator.
 Final copy of the digital file is to be turned in on the day each group presents.
 Presentation materials should include at a minimum:
o Introduction of team members

COURSE INSTRUCTIONAL POLICIES
Organization and Conduct of Class
This class will meet on Tuesday and Thursday mornings for approximately 80 minutes to review the
assignments, concepts and materials. My assumption is that you will have already read the text and will
be coming to class prepared to discuss your thoughts and/or position on the material. Note that lectures
and presentations are a supplement to the readings rather than a rehash of what you’ve already seen.
The real value of the course will come from our interactions and discussions on concepts and real-world
examples. Accordingly, it is necessary for you to plan to attend class on a regular basis to keep up to
speed. Attendance will be monitored and will count as an element of your final grade.
OSU e-mail
Both OSU and I will use your OSU email address for all official communications. It is vital that you
access your OSU email on a regular basis to ensure that you will not miss any critical communications
for which you will be held accountable. If you need help with the management of your email account,
please contact the OSU IT Service Desk at (614) 688-4357.
Academic Integrity
All policies on academic honesty will be strictly enforced. Along with preparing for and attending
classes, each student has the responsibility of promoting high academic standards. Academic dishonesty
includes: (a) cheating; (b) fabrications and falsifications; (c) multiple submissions; (d) plagiarism; and
(e) complicity in academic dishonesty. Proven cases of dishonesty may result in a grade of ""F"" in the
course and will be referred for University disciplinary action consistent with the Student Code of
Conduct.
Disability Services Statement
Students with a documented disability who wish to request reasonable accommodations should contact
the Student Life Disability Services Office first to request accommodations, and then meet with their
instructors. Accommodation arrangements should be made during the first two weeks of the semester.
Students may request accommodations at any time during the semester, but please note:
accommodations are not retroactive. Students must contact the Student Life Disability Services Office
prior to every semester that accommodations are needed, and their email is. The Ohio State University and its faculty are
committed to helping you meet your individual needs, and to supporting your efforts for a quality
education.

Mental Health Services Statement
As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning. These can include
things such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol or drug-related problems, feeling down,
difficulty concentrating, and/or a lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
3
lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in normal daily
activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns
you may be experiencing.
If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, you can learn more
about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the Office of Student
Life’s Counseling and Consultation Service (CCS). You can contact them at ccs.osu.edu, or by calling
(614) 292-5766. CCS offices are located on the 4th Floor of the Younkin Success Center, and the 10th Floor
of Lincoln Tower. You can also reach an on-call counselor when CCS is closed by calling (614) 292-5766.
24-hour emergency help is also available through the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-
TALK, or at.
Dennis Learning Center Support
The Dennis Learning Center’s goal is to help support and improve the academic success of Ohio State
students through academic coaching, group workshops, and elective courses. We offer free, one-hour
appointments in which you can discuss various topics (note-taking, procrastination, test anxiety, exam
preparation, time-management, etc.) with an academic coach and create a plan for success. The DLC is
located on the 2nd floor of the Younkin Success Center. Visit our
website to learn more.
Guidelines for Project Teams
 Each team project for this course should represent a culmination of the efforts of each
individual member of the project team. No one person should be held responsible for the
work assigned.
 All team assignments should reflect the total collaboration and participation of its individual
members.
 Each member’s total participation becomes the responsibility of the entire team and will be
reflected in the final grades.
 You will participate in a process of collectively determining performance expectations for
each other and for the team as a whole. You will subsequently be assessed by teammates as
to the quality and consistency of your contributions and your record of meeting team
expectations.
Dropping the Course
University policies will be followed. Please consult with your academic advisor for exact dates for
dropping a course without penalty.
Submissions of Assignments
All written work will be submitted to turnitin.com in an electronic format. No assignments will be
accepted in any form other than electronic submission to the Drop Box. All work must meet
requirements for APA documentation format and minimum length requirements. If a submission is
4
deficient on either of these measures, it will not be accepted and will be considered late. No work will be
accepted via email unless previously approved by the instructor. If you are submitting work late, bring it
with you to the next class. All late submissions will incur a minimum 20% deduction from the total
available points for that assignment. No submissions will be accepted after one week from the due date
without prior approval from the instructor.
Instructor Expectations
The classroom will be the place for interaction, discussion, demonstration, exploration and mastery of
the concepts presented and discussed. Each of you brings an element of diversity to the classroom that
can help to maximize the learning potential of all students, if we capitalize on this diversity. A few
expectations for helping us to achieve this would include:
 -- Preparation: Come to class with an understanding of the main points presented in the
notes, and be sure that you have read all assigned materials. Also, strive to bring new
information to the discussion, things that you have found or personally experienced.
 -- Attendance: I expect full attendance at all the class sessions.
 -- Involvement: In class, I expect that you will be fully engaged and participate
enthusiastically in all class discussions.
 -- Reflection: Your course readings, films, classroom exercises, and discussions should challenge some
of your perceptions of leadership and human behavior in a community. It will be helpful for you to write
your reactions down as you note them so that can refer back to them at a later date.
Campus Emergency
In the unusual event of a major campus emergency, course requirements,
deadlines and grading
percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a revised
semester calendar or other
circumstances. 
 A Final Word About Classroom Etiquette
Respect for the pursuit of truth requires that we behave in ways that contribute to the collegial spirit:
punctuality, preparation, reading the assignments ahead of class in order to be prepared for enthusiastic
participation in discussions, careful study, academic honesty, politeness in arguments that may arise out
of differing points of view, the use of our best critical thinking skills, and meeting deadlines, all facilitate
this effort. Since we believe that something special goes on in the classroom, we are also expected to
pay attention to what the instructor and our colleagues say, and to refrain from becoming a distraction to
others. In this spirit, cell phones are to be turned off when you come into the classroom, unless you have
a specific need to be contacted, and have obtained prior approval from the instructor. No iPod’s, MP3
Players, video games, or other electronic devices are to be turned on during the class period.

MAJOR ASSIGNMENTS
MH Connect =Weekly Exercises (200 Total Points)
Students will be required to purchase an access code for MH Connect with this
course. During the first seven weeks of the course, there will be specific
assignments to be completed along with a corresponding due date. All exercises
will be worth a total of 10 points, and the total points available will be 200 points.
All information needed for access, training, and setting up your MH Connect
account is available on the Canvas homepage under the Modules section. All
assignment grades will automatically be recorded into the official grade book. All
assignments will have a time limit of up to one hour, depending on the complexity
of the exercises. Realistically, you shouldn’t need anywhere near that amount of
time. The only constraint is that once you log in, you must finish the assignment
you are working on before you log out. Each assignment will have one attempt per
student. No late submissions will be accepted.
Company Paper Team Report (100 Points)
Students in this course will be set up into teams for a group project. The first
element of the group project will be due to the Drop Box at the end of Week 5, and
will be worth a total of 100 points. Details for this project are as follows:
 Purpose of the assigned paper is to provide students with the opportunity to apply teachings and
learnings from the first 3 weeks of the course to a “real world” company. Students should select
their preferred company by the second week of the course and identify their choice in the
appropriate discussion board on Canvas. Students should then address the 7 questions/concepts
listed below in a written paper of no more than 6 pages.
 Select a retailer of your choosing based on the following criteria: (1) company must be a
publically traded company with revenues in excess of $500 million USD, (2) company must
operate stores, and (3) company must operate in a least two retail channels.
1) How does this company “create” value?
2) Who is the primary competitor for this company (why are they primary competitors)?
3) What channels does this company operate in?
4) What challenges does the retailer face regarding multi-channel retailing (Omni-channel retailing)?
5) What is the company’s retail strategy?
6) Based on the key financial metrics, what do you conclude about the management path of the company
and its performance relative to the primary competitor from question #2?
7) What type of retail locations does your company operate in and why does the retailer chose to operate
in these locations?
On an additional (7th) page, students should provide a chart comparing the following key financial
metrics for the most recent year that fiscal details are available. Provide details for your company as
well as their chief competitor.
 Net Sales ($)
 Gross Margin ($)
 Gross Margin %
 Operating Income %
8
 Same Store Sales
 Inventory Turnover
 Return on Assets Managed
 Sales per store in operation
Students are encouraged to visit their chosen company’s store locations as well as competitor stores.
Students are also encouraged to read their company’s latest Annual Report and 10k to understand the
retailer more in-depth. Students are also encouraged to use onsite and remote resources of the OSU’s
libraries These resources as well as the required course text should provide you
with sufficient resources to complete the assignment.
The grading rubric for this assignment will be as follows:

Case Discussion – Team Leadership of Discussion (50 points)
One of the most important competencies of an effective marketer or leader is the
ability to review data and articulate a point of view on a specific issue. Throughout
this course, we will be reviewing case studies, critical thinking exercises, and
learning objective reviews. Each of your project teams will be assigned as a leader
for one of the scheduled discussions. Your responsibilities will include the
following:
 Identify what the key facts are in the specific issue / case / etc. to be
reviewed.
 Provide a personal point of view, individually as well as a team position, on
the issue at hand.
 Lead the class discussion on the facts and how your team came to your
conclusions.
 Identify and discuss alternate positions from others in the class.
 Provide specific recommendations to be implemented based on your
position.
 Teams can present in any format. That means that you can all lead the
discussion, or you can assign one person to spearhead your efforts.
 Discussions are to take no more than 15 minutes.
Leading the class discussions will be worth a total of 50 points for each team
member. Score will be awarded according to the following rubric:
 Organization and Clarity of Key Points in Presentation
9
o Organization and flow of material
o All relevant facts and issues identified
o Depth of analysis

Executive Review Committee (50 Total Points)
As each team takes their turn leading the case discussion outlined above, one of
the other teams will be assigned as the Executive Review Committee. The ERC will
have the responsibility of reviewing the case and any notes provided by the
presenting team in advance of the presentation. Once the team has finished
presenting their facts and recommendations, the ERC will have the responsibility to
demonstrate their knowledge and critical thinking on the case by asking relevant
and/or value-added questions to the presenting team. Presenting teams must
turn their data over to the ERC no later than 48 hours prior to the
presentation. Please note that this isn’t an opportunity to try and trip up anyone
else in the class, it is merely an opportunity for students to gain experience asking
the right questions, in the right manner, and at the right time.
Class Participation (100 Total Points)
Student scores for class participation will come from three specific areas: class
attendance, class engagement and participation, and engagement in the weekly
discussion topics and other uses of the course BB. Students are expected to
come to each class fully prepared to discuss their individual assignments
as well as any other work indicated in the weekly planning guide for this
course. Additionally, each student is expected to be an active participant in his or
her respective project teams. All students will have the responsibility to provide
feedback on the contributions of their teammates at the end of the course.
Examples of the expectations for each of these areas are also included on the
course homepage on Canvas. Note that attendance, while optional, will count
toward your final grade. Please be sure to read the guidelines for class
participation that are posted on Canvas in the Discussion Boards.
TEAM PROJECT – PROJECTING THE FUTURE FOR YOUR TARGET
RETAIL COMPANY
PROJECT OVERVIEW
The purpose of this team project is to build on the work already completed for
week five, and give the students an opportunity to demonstrate their mastery of
10
the basic concepts from the course. Students will continue to work in the same
teams as before. This time you will demonstrate your mastery of the course
concepts, the external market trends, and the issues faced by your target retailers.
Your teams will think critically about the current status and influences, and then
develop and articulate specific projections for your target company. You will
develop a written proposal as well as a formal presentation on how you see the
future unfolding for your retailer. Will they stay on the same track, will they be in
business, what will be different, what changes will be needed to remain relevant in
the retail environment of 2025. Be sure to consider the impact of demographics,
technology, legal and regulatory implications, and pricing and profit structures.
There is no right or wrong answer for any of the teams. I’m more interested in how
you develop your positioning by critical thinking and synthesis than I am in the
viability of your position. Be creative!
Guidelines for this project will be as follows:
 In the first two weeks of the course, all students will be randomly assigned to
a Project Group. Final group size will depend on the total enrollment for the
course.
 Each group will then select their target retailer to be used for all team
elements of the group projects.
Once your teams have been assigned and you have become familiar with each
other, you will then be expected to do the following:
 Meet as a team and develop a working agreement for how the assignment is
to be addressed, specific responsibilities for each member, and expectations
for performance.
 Select a target retailer.
 Complete the work required to deliver the report for week 5.
 Assess the current trends / issues / opportunities / implications that surround
your target retailer’s business model.
 Think critically on how all these elements will work together over the next
few years.
 Articulate a recommendation for what the future holds for your retailer.
 Identify what they will need to do to remain relevant in the future market.
 Define your specific growth strategy.
 Develop a Marketing Plan Recommendation Presentation to be
delivered in the final classes of the semester. Guidelines for this also appear
later in this document.
A note about your groups.
 The group is to work together to complete this project.
 All members of the group will receive the same grade for both the written
element as well as the formal presentation.
 Groups are free to divide up the work in any manner they deem appropriate.
 Each team member will provide a formal team evaluation on the
participation of the members. These will be due on the day that your group
presents to the class.
11
 I will make every effort to give your teams time at the end of class periods to
meet and catch up on planning and/or address any issues. You should also
plan to meet outside of class time to complete this assignment.
Team Project - Final In-Class Presentation (100 points)
Once all research and development work has been completed, all groups will
prepare a presentation for the class to be delivered in the final weeks of the class.
Group presentations guidelines will be as follows:
 Format for presentations (slides / presenters) will be at the discretion of each
group.
 Presentations are to be 12-15 minutes, no longer.
 Groups should be prepared to address questions from the class and/or the
facilitator.
 Final copy of the digital file is to be turned in on the day each group presents.
 Presentation materials should include at a minimum:
o Introduction of team members
o Overview of the key project details
 Retailer selected / rationale
 Summary of the factors from week 5 and strategic opportunities
o Specific market opportunity recommended
 What does the future hold for your retailer?
 What do they need to do / change / adjust to stay relevant in
2025?

Course Description
The course covers foundational inferential methods for learning about populations from samples, including point and interval estimation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses. Statistical theory is introduced to justify the approaches. The course emphasizes challenges that arise when applying classical ideas to big-data, partially through the use of computational and simulation techniques.

Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to…

Describe the role of a parameter in a statistical model and its relationship to observed data.
Use data to estimate and describe uncertainty about the parameters of a statistical model.
Translate scientific hypotheses about a population into mathematical statements about parameters in a statistical model.
Formulate statistical procedures to test a hypothesis about parameters in a statistical model, and interpret the results in both statistical and application-specific terms.
Explain the difference between statistical and practical significance in massive data settings.
Appreciate the effect of missing data on statistical inference.
Evaluate and compare different statistical procedures for answering the same question.
Grading
Assessments
There will be four types of assessments used in the course; homework, labs, projects, and exams. For each individual assignment or exam, specific policies and directions will be included with the release of an assignment, or in advance of an exam.

Homework: There will be a total of 10 homework assignments, one for each topic of the course. The lowest two homework scores will be dropped from the recorded grades. Except for the first week, homework will occur regularly during any week there is not an exam or a project presentation, subject to minor variation with advance notice. Homework will be due at the beginning of class on the stated due date. Grading will be based on a combination of completion, correctness, and presentation. For full credit, final answers must be appropriately justified. The eight highest homework scores will account for a total of 20% of the overall grade, that is, 2.5% each.

Labs: Lab exercises using R and R Markdown will be carried out in approximately half of the recitation sessions. These lab exercises will be documented using R Markdown and turned in via Carmen, and together account for 10% of the overall grade. Due dates will be announced as labs are released.

Projects: There will be two data analysis projects, which will be completed in groups of 3-4 students. Each group will be provided with a data set and several questions related to it. The first project will focus on modeling and parameter estimation; the second project will focus on applying and extending the statistical methods learned in class. Students will present their work in class (10 minute presentations) and also submit a write-up of their results using R Markdown (approximately 3 pages of text, plus any additional figures and tables). Each project will be worth 10% of the overall grade.

Midterm Exams: There will be two in-class midterm exams. Statistical tables will be provided as needed. Calculators may be used on the exams, however no devices with communication abilities are allowed, in particular, mobile phones may not be used. You may use one 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of paper (both sides), with whatever facts, formulas, or explanations you find helpful, for each exam. Each midterm will determine 15% of the overall grade. Like homework, to obtain full credit correct answers must be supported by appropriate justifications, calculations, or explanations. Incorrect answers supported by substantially correct calculations and explanations will receive proportionally appropriate partial credit. Correct answers, unsupported by calculations, explanation, or algebraic work will receive no credit. Midterm I will be given on Thursday, February 7. Midterm II will be given on Thursday, March 28.

Final Exam: A cumulative final examination that accounts for 20% of the overall grade will be given during the University determined examination period of Wednesday, April 24, 8:00 AM - 9:45 AM. Except for the time allotted, the final exam policies are the same as those for the midterm exams.

Course Policies
Email Communications
In order to protect your privacy, all course e-mail correspondence must be done through a valid Ohio State University name.## account. The subject line of the email must begin with [STAT 3202] followed by an informative message.

If an email is sent between 9:00 AM Monday and 11:59 PM Thursday, and you follow the above directions, the staff will make an effort to respond within 24 hours. Homework questions sent the same day a homework is due run the risk of not receiving a response before the homework is due. Plan accordingly and consider office hours as a more reliable alternative.

Data Analytics Learning Center
Graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) for STAT 3201, 3202, 3301, 3302, 3303 and 4620 will hold their office hours in the Data Analytics Learning Center (DALC) in Pomerene 151. The hours during which the GTA and grader for our course will hold office hours in PO 151 can be found at the top of the syllabus. You can meet with the GTAs for our course in the DALC during their office hours to discuss questions you have about the course material, homework assignments, R, etc.

You are welcome to stop by the DALC when it is open even if it is not currently being staffed by the GTA for our course, e.g. if you are looking for a place to study or work on an assignment for one of the supported courses. If the DALC is staffed by a GTA for another Statistics course when you stop by, they will help you if possible, but may not be able to answer all of your questions.

A complete list of hours during which the DALC will be staffed by GTAs for Statistics Department courses can be found at https://data-analytics.osu.edu/dalc.

In rare situations due to last minute emergencies, the GTA assigned to the DALC may not be able to attend their office hours. If the DALC is closed when the schedule indicates it should be open, we recommend waiting for a few minutes. If no one shows up in a reasonable amount of time, please email your instructor to let us know about the problem. You can also contact your GTA to see about arranging a make-up time to meet.

Grade Disputes
If you feel a homework, exam, lab, or project was graded incorrectly, you have one week from the date it was returned to discuss it with the course instructor. After one week, grading is final except for exceptional circumstances. You may not simply ask for a re-grade, but instead must justify to the staff why the grading was done incorrectly. Also, by disputing any grading, you agree to allow the course staff to review the entire assignment or exam for other errors missed during grading.

Makeup Exams
If you absolutely need a makeup exam and have a valid excuse, please contact the instructor to make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible. However, you must give notice in advance in such a situation. A make-up exam could potentially be perceived to be more difficult than a regularly scheduled exam since the instructor cannot guarantee that two exams containing different questions have exactly equal degrees of difficulty. Any make-up exam must be taken within a week of the missed exam. Exceptions to this policy will be permitted only in extreme situations such as serious injury immediately prior to an exam or severe illness requiring hospitalization.

Attendence
You are expected to attend all lectures and recitations. Failure to do so may not have a direct effect on your course grade, but will likely have a significant indirect effect. Any known or potential extracurricular conflicts should be discussed in person with the instructor during the first week of class, or as soon as they arise.

Academic Misconduct
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with examinations. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the Code of Student Conduct http://studentlife.osu.edu/csc/.

Special Accommodations
The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, I may request that you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. SLDS contact information: slds@osu.edu; 614-292-3307; slds.osu.edu; 098 Baker Hall, 113 W. 12th Avenue.

Policy Changes and Updates
Within reason and with advance notice, the instructor reserves the right to make any changes that are considered academically advisable. Such changes, if any, will be announced in class. Please note that it is your responsibility to attend the class and keep track of the proceedings. These changes are likely to contain minor changes to the schedule, however no changes will be made to the exam dates.

A complete list of hours during which the DALC will be staffed by GTAs for Statistics Department courses can be found at

In rare situations due to last minute emergencies, the GTA assigned to the DALC may not be able to attend their office hours. If the DALC is closed when the schedule indicates it should be open, we recommend waiting for a few minutes. If no one shows up in a reasonable amount of time, please email your instructor to let us know about the problem. You can also contact your GTA to see about arranging a make-up time to meet.

Grade Disputes
If you feel a homework, exam, lab, or project was graded incorrectly, you have one week from the date it was returned to discuss it with the course instructor. After one week, grading is final except for exceptional circumstances. You may not simply ask for a re-grade, but instead must justify to the staff why the grading was done incorrectly. Also, by disputing any grading, you agree to allow the course staff to review the entire assignment or exam for other errors missed during grading.

Makeup Exams
If you absolutely need a makeup exam and have a valid excuse, please contact the instructor to make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible. However, you must give notice in advance in such a situation. A make-up exam could potentially be perceived to be more difficult than a regularly scheduled exam since the instructor cannot guarantee that two exams containing different questions have exactly equal degrees of difficulty. Any make-up exam must be taken within a week of the missed exam. Exceptions to this policy will be permitted only in extreme situations such as serious injury immediately prior to an exam or severe illness requiring hospitalization.

Attendence
You are expected to attend all lectures and recitations. Failure to do so may not have a direct effect on your course grade, but will likely have a significant indirect effect. Any known or potential extracurricular conflicts should be discussed in person with the instructor during the first week of class, or as soon as they arise.

Academic Misconduct
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with examinations. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the Code of Student Conduct 

Special Accommodations
The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, I may request that you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. 

Policy Changes and Updates
Within reason and with advance notice, the instructor reserves the right to make any changes that are considered academically advisable. Such changes, if any, will be announced in class. Please note that it is your responsibility to attend the class and keep track of the proceedings. These changes are likely to contain minor changes to the schedule, however no changes will be made to the exam dates.

Overview

This course examines the history of the United States from the 1900s to the 1990s with an emphasis on how political, economic, and social developments shaped the conditions, attitudes, and values of present-day America. Subjects to be discussed in readings and in class include the Progressive Era, the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, Rooseveltís New Deal, World War II, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam War, Johnsonís Great Society, the student protest and counterculture movements of the 1960s, and social changes in recent decades.
 

Course Objectives:

ï This course will provide students with a general overview of the events, trends, people, politics, and culture of twentieth-century America. The course will focus on political and social history ó particularly the relationship of state and society ó and will help students place their experiences, their interests, and other history courses in context.
ï This course will develop basic skills in the discipline of history. Primary among these is the skill of shaping, substantiating, and communicating historical arguments.
 
 

Expectations                                                                                                                                                                    Top        Home

The course will be taught by a combination of lecture and discussion. This design requires active learning on your part. The assignments have been designed to help you to engage with the material and to evaluate your learning on that basis.
 

A. Participation and Attendance

Class meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday between 12:30 and 1:20 AM in Scaife Hall 324 (unless otherwise noted). You are expected to attend class regularly and on time, to read the material assigned before class, and to participate in discussion in a frequent and substantive manner. You should involve yourselves in class discussion by asking questions, participating in group activities, and contributing your thoughts, interpretations, and ideas.

Obviously, you need to attend class in order to participate. Attendance will be recorded. You will be allowed three absences; subsequent absences will result in the loss of one-third of a letter grade from the ""participation"" grade for each day missed.
 

B. Reading Credits

On ten randomly chosen days throughout the semester, I will give you a chance to show that you have completed the reading assigned for that day. You will answer a single question drawn from that dayís reading assignment, and will receive one percentage point when you correctly answer the question. The questions will be very simple; if youíve done the reading assignment for that day, you should have not trouble receiving full credit. If you are not in attendance that day of class, you may not make up the reading credit opportunity unless you have an approved and verified excuse (e.g., doctorís note).
 

C. Papers

This course includes two papers, due on September 22 and November 20. You will be asked to answer a thematic question (on topics that will be assigned at least three class sessions before the paper is due) in between 4 and 5 pages. You are expected to base these papers on classroom lectures, discussions, and reading assignments; no extra research is necessary. This paper should make an historical argument, must have a clear thesis statement, and must use evidence to support that thesis. What is an historical argument? Historical arguments are well-defended, original interpretations of historical events based upon evidence. Itís not easy to make your own historical argument; this course will give you practice doing so.

Papers will be due in my mailbox in Baker 240 by 5:00 PM on the dates assigned. For late papers, one letter grade will be deducted for each weekday that they are late. Papers are to be typed, proofread, and double-spaced in a 12-point font.

Paper 1 Topic                Paper 2 Topic

D. Exams

This course will have an in-class midterm exam on October 18 and a final exam on a date to be determined by the registrar. The exams will be in essay format.

A. Grading

I do all the grading for this course. Please feel free to come to office and discus any question concerning grading that you might have. I grade on a point system; even if I put a ""letter"" grade on your papers, I will indicate how many point out of the total for that assignment you have earned. At the end of the term, total point out of 100 will be translated into letter grades as follows: 90 to 100 = A; 80 to 89 = B; etc.

Grades will be distributed in the following way:

Attendance & participation       5%
Reading credits                         10%
Paper 1                                     20%
Paper 2                                     20%
Midterm Exam                         20%
Final Exam                               25%
                                               100%

B. Classroom Behavior.

This course is designed to encourage students to develop opinions and arguments concerning history and film. Therefore, it is important that all members of the class feel that they can come to class and express their ideas in a free and accepting environment. Any actions that might tend to limit that freedom of expression is discouraged. Please be considerate of your fellow classmates.
 

C. Academic Integrity

I expect all students to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. Any violations of university policies regarding cheating or plagiarism, as outlined in the Student Handbook, will not be tolerated.
 

D. Alternative Arrangements

The Office of Equal Opportunity Services provides support services for both physically disabled and learning disabled students. For individualized academic adjustment based on a documented disability, contact Equal Opportunity Services at eos@andrew.cmu.edu or (412) 268-2012.

Overview

This course examines the history of the United States from the 1900s to the 1990s with an emphasis on how political, economic, and social developments shaped the conditions, attitudes, and values of present-day America. Subjects to be discussed in readings and in class include the Progressive Era, the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, Rooseveltís New Deal, World War II, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam War, Johnsonís Great Society, the student protest and counterculture movements of the 1960s, and social changes in recent decades.
 

Course Objectives:

ï This course will provide students with a general overview of the events, trends, people, politics, and culture of twentieth-century America. The course will focus on political and social history ó particularly the relationship of state and society ó and will help students place their experiences, their interests, and other history courses in context.
ï This course will develop basic skills in the discipline of history. Primary among these is the skill of shaping, substantiating, and communicating historical arguments.
 
 

Expectations                                                                                                                                                                    Top        Home

The course will be taught by a combination of lecture and discussion. This design requires active learning on your part. The assignments have been designed to help you to engage with the material and to evaluate your learning on that basis.
 

A. Participation and Attendance

Class meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday between 12:30 and 1:20 AM in Scaife Hall 324 (unless otherwise noted). You are expected to attend class regularly and on time, to read the material assigned before class, and to participate in discussion in a frequent and substantive manner. You should involve yourselves in class discussion by asking questions, participating in group activities, and contributing your thoughts, interpretations, and ideas.

Obviously, you need to attend class in order to participate. Attendance will be recorded. You will be allowed three absences; subsequent absences will result in the loss of one-third of a letter grade from the ""participation"" grade for each day missed.
 

B. Reading Credits

On ten randomly chosen days throughout the semester, I will give you a chance to show that you have completed the reading assigned for that day. You will answer a single question drawn from that dayís reading assignment, and will receive one percentage point when you correctly answer the question. The questions will be very simple; if youíve done the reading assignment for that day, you should have not trouble receiving full credit. If you are not in attendance that day of class, you may not make up the reading credit opportunity unless you have an approved and verified excuse (e.g., doctorís note).
 

C. Papers

This course includes two papers, due on September 22 and November 20. You will be asked to answer a thematic question (on topics that will be assigned at least three class sessions before the paper is due) in between 4 and 5 pages. You are expected to base these papers on classroom lectures, discussions, and reading assignments; no extra research is necessary. This paper should make an historical argument, must have a clear thesis statement, and must use evidence to support that thesis. What is an historical argument? Historical arguments are well-defended, original interpretations of historical events based upon evidence. Itís not easy to make your own historical argument; this course will give you practice doing so.

Papers will be due in my mailbox in Baker 240 by 5:00 PM on the dates assigned. For late papers, one letter grade will be deducted for each weekday that they are late. Papers are to be typed, proofread, and double-spaced in a 12-point font.

Paper 1 Topic                Paper 2 Topic

D. Exams

This course will have an in-class midterm exam on October 18 and a final exam on a date to be determined by the registrar. The exams will be in essay format.

A. Grading

I do all the grading for this course. Please feel free to come to office and discus any question concerning grading that you might have. I grade on a point system; even if I put a ""letter"" grade on your papers, I will indicate how many point out of the total for that assignment you have earned. At the end of the term, total point out of 100 will be translated into letter grades as follows: 90 to 100 = A; 80 to 89 = B; etc.

Grades will be distributed in the following way:

Attendance & participation       5%
Reading credits                         10%
Paper 1                                     20%
Paper 2                                     20%
Midterm Exam                         20%
Final Exam                               25%
                                               100%

B. Classroom Behavior.

This course is designed to encourage students to develop opinions and arguments concerning history and film. Therefore, it is important that all members of the class feel that they can come to class and express their ideas in a free and accepting environment. Any actions that might tend to limit that freedom of expression is discouraged. Please be considerate of your fellow classmates.
 

C. Academic Integrity

I expect all students to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. Any violations of university policies regarding cheating or plagiarism, as outlined in the Student Handbook, will not be tolerated.
 

D. Alternative Arrangements

The Office of Equal Opportunity Services provides support services for both physically disabled and learning disabled students. For individualized academic adjustment based on a documented disability, contact Equal Opportunity Services at eos@andrew.cmu.edu or (412) 268-2012.

Ever since the invention of motion pictures in the late 1800s, the silver screen has served as a
canvas for filmmakers and masses of cinemagoers alike for imagining events and people from
distant times and places. Even with the advances in transportation today, most people still have
to rely on the mass media to learn about the world. How does film as a medium benefit or
undermine our understanding of the past? How should artists, historians, and audiences handle
the history depicted in cinema? This course will answer these questions by focusing on the
filmography of one particular actor with a worldwide reach and the ways he portrayed various
episodes in the modern era. Through lectures, discussions, readings, assignments, and movie

screenings, we will examine events within the formation of the transatlantic realm, East Asian
modernization, World War II, the Cold War, and the post-9/11 order. By the end of the course,
students will come to appreciate the persuasive power of film, the importance of the past for the
present and future, and the roles of the arts and humanities in society.
Learning Objectives
By the end of the semester, students should be able to:
1. Articulate different definitions of history
2. Discuss the meanings of humanity, loyalty, idealism, courage, and patriotism
3. Analyze the context, credibility, and purpose of any given information
4. Think critically about the relations among fact, artefact, presentation, and representation
5. Craft effective verbal and written arguments by combining evidence, logic, and creativity
Assignments and Assessment
The final grade consists of the following components:
24% Attendance and participation (recitations and film screenings)
8% Quizzes
14% Paper #1 (3–4 pages)
16% Paper #2 (3–4 pages)
18% Paper #3 (4–5 pages)
20% Paper #4 (5–6 pages)
As you can see, no single assignment will make or break your course grade. This is designed to
give you a chance to recover if you did not do well in any one task. The ascending worth of the
papers rewards students who persevere and improve during the semester. Although the diverse
types of assignments give students with different skill sets the opportunity to excel, in order to
succeed in the class one must be able to write well and compose sound arguments, as reflected in
the overweighing of written assignments versus oral participation and knowledge retention.
This course adheres to the grading standards of the university, see
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html.
Course Policies
- In the classroom:
o Attendance in recitation and film screening is mandatory. Students are allowed
three absences without impact on their grade. Students who miss two or fewer of
the meetings will receive a bonus in the final grade. Beyond the three absences,
additional absences may be excused only on a case-by-case basis for documented
causes.
o Even if an absence to a film screening is excused, students are still responsible for
the content of the film. The films are available for viewing in the library and also
through streaming services.
o Come to class on time and stay focused until the period is over. Persistent
tardiness or early departure will damage a student’s participation grade.
o Students may not use any electronic device during class. If you would like to
request an exemption, please approach the teaching staff.
o Please leave your mobile phone off for the duration of class. We will be
embarking on a flight back in time. Do not interfere with the navigational systems.

- Regarding assignments:
o Except the last assignment, the papers must be turned in as a hard copy on the due
date, though electronic copies may also be requested. A paper will lose ten
percent of its grade for each day it is late.
o Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Any instance of plagiarism can result in a failing
course grade and other disciplinary measures. If you are not sure whether you are
plagiarizing, ask the teaching staff for advice. For more information, see
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm.
- In general:
o Treat everyone in the course with respect. This means, among other things,
staying attentive during class, putting effort into the assignments, listening to
others, refraining from distracting others, and addressing all emails properly.
o The teaching staff reserves the right to alter the syllabus to meet the learning
objectives, accommodate contingencies, or for similar legitimate reasons.
o Enjoy the class and have fun!
Tips for Success
- If in doubt, ask. Ask early and often—do not delay in seeking help. Feel free to come to
the office hours of the instructor or the teaching assistants. In fact, you are encouraged to
visit the office hours of the teaching staff at least once during the semester.
- Do not fall behind in either reading or writing. It is very difficult to play catch-up.
- Since this course is not a comprehensive survey covering all aspects of modern world
history, several events will only be discussed briefly, with the expectation that students
already command the basic information. If you find yourself encountering unfamiliar
historical facts, feel free to ask the teaching staff.
- Since written assignments account for a large portion of the grade, it is crucial for
students to hone their writing skill. Keep in mind that proofreading and revision are
necessary steps for good writing, not an afterthought. Besides the teaching staff, there are
resources to help you with your writing, such as:
o Peer tutoring and other help at Academic Development, see
http://www.cmu.edu/acadev/
o One-on-one tutoring in written, oral, and visual communication at the Global
Communications Center, see http://www.cmu.edu/gcc/
o If English is not your native language, the Intercultural Communications Center
can also help, see http://www.cmu.edu/icc/
- Students with special needs or disabilities should inform the teaching staff if they would
like to request certain accommodations. They should also contact Disability Resources at
access@andrew.cmu.edu or 412-268-2013, and Equal Opportunity Services and
Disability Resources, see http://www.cmu.edu/hr/eos/disability/students/.

Course Overview
In this course we look at the history of a single place—Boston—to see how a city began
and developed, and how the history of a single place can offer insight into larger
historical changes and questions. Boston history is most often memorialized and
remembered as Revolutionary War history and Colonial history. This course explores that
celebrated history, but students will also unearth the many cities and people that have
also existed here over time.
Boston is often called a “historic” city, but what does that mean? What history do
Bostonians and visitors to Boston collectively remember and celebrate, and why? What
gets lost and forgotten? In this course, we will consider these questions.
This course uses Boston as a laboratory for historical inquiry, while also offering an
introduction to the craft of “doing” history through primary source analysis and archival
research in Boston. As a key part of the course, students will visit the Massachusetts
Historical Society and perform their own archival research and historical interpretation.
Each week we will read primary and secondary sources, and we will think critically and
discuss what these sources might tell us about the past.
2
Many weeks, we will actively engage real spaces in Boston, from the Boston Common
and Beacon Hill, to the city’s “Emerald Necklace” of parks that were designed in the
nineteenth century.
Assignments will include exams, presentations, and papers. Your major assignment will
involve working at the Massachusetts Historical Society with at least one original
primary source. At the end of the semester, on MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, our class
will make a public exhibition and presentation at the Massachusetts Historical Society.
***PLEASE NOTE: Our final class presentation will be held at the Massachusetts
Historical Society on Monday, December 9 at 6pm (and will go until about 8pm). If
you cannot make this event, you cannot take this course, unfortunately. Please mark
your calendars now!

Attendance and Class Participation
Attendance and participation are mandatory. It is up to you to make sure that you sign in
to get credit for your attendance in lectures discussion sections. If you arrive late, please
notify the instructor at the end of the class.
For discussion sections, it’s also very important that you participate actively and
thoughtfully. Discussion sections are your opportunity to engage with the readings for
that week, and to raise any questions or observations you have. This is also an
opportunity to listen and converse with other students, and to take in and respond to
different perspectives in a thoughtful and respectful way. If you are shy or unsure how to
participate, please visit office hours or talk with me or your TF so we can discuss how
you can better prepare for class discussions.
Attendance in lectures and discussion sections is mandatory. For every absence, students
will be marked down 3 points (out of 100 from your participation grade). You are
allowed two absences from lectures—for any reason--without penalty. If you need to
miss class additional classes due to special circumstances, please come speak with me
(and your TF) during office hours so we can determine a way for you to make up the inclass work you will or have missed. Up to one unexcused absence may be made up by
submitting a two-page reflection essay on the week’s readings. 
3
Attendance on the walking tours and visits to MHS are also mandatory. Because our class
will move around from time to time, please read the syllabus carefully and mark your
calendars. I will do my best to remind you of upcoming obligations, but the syllabus and
Blackboard will ultimately be your best guide.
Disabilities
Students with documented disabilities or special needs should contact the professor
within the first week for accommodations. For more information, please contact the
Office of Disability Services at (617) 353-3658. All discussions will be confidential.
Computers
Computers are not allowed during lectures. One important part of historical thinking and
scholarship is being present and focused. While computers can be helpful in certain types
of historical analysis, they tend to be major distractions in a lecture. Please take notes by
hand. The use of laptops in discussion sections is up to the discretion of your teaching
fellow and may change week-to-week.
Cell Phones
Cell phone use and texting is never allowed in class.
Email
Whenever possible, please address your questions to me and your TF’s in person, either
after class or during office hours. I usually check and respond to emails once or twice per
day. (Your TF’s will have their own email policies.) I will try to respond as soon as
possible, but please plan for at least 24 hours for a response to any email.
Academic Conduct
Your work for this course must be your own. Quoting or using another person’s ideas
without attribution, or presenting another person’s work as your own, are forms of
plagiarism. If you are found plagiarizing, you will receive a failing grade for the
assignment, and possibly the course, with possible further sanctions by the University
Academic Conduct Committee. Students should consult the Boston University Academic
Conduct Code: http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/
It is your responsibility to read these policies carefully and to know exactly what
constitutes plagiarism.
Late Work
All in-class presentations must be made on the day they are assigned. Students who do
not present on their assigned day will not get credit for the assignment.
Written work is to be handed in at the very start of class on the date listed on the syllabus,
unless otherwise specified. A paper will be marked down 1/3 of a grade for each 24 hours
that it is late (an A will become an A-, a B+ will become a B, etc.). Assignments more
than one week late will not be accepted. I will consider extensions when there is a
compelling reason and sufficient notice. If you need an extension, talk with me well in
advance of the assignment.

Landmark Essay and Presentation Assignment
At the beginning of the semester each student will sign up for a day to present a
“landmark” that they have found in Boston. This can be anything from a plaque on the
side of a building, to a historical site. It can also be a site that is not yet commemorated,
but which you would like to memorialize. It can be something that is publicly
commemorated, or something that is not memorialized at all. At the beginning of each
discussion section, one to two students will present their findings in a short presentation
to the class. We will discuss the assignment further, but here are the basics:
• Take a selfie in front of the site. This is key. You must actually GO TO
THE SITE! If there is a plaque or physical marker of any kind, take a
picture of that, too.
• In 1,100-1,500 words, explore the history of that landmark or site. Focus
your analysis on how this landmark has been commemorated (or not) and
why.
o Is there evidence of commemoration (a plaque, a marker, etc.)?
o If there is a plaque, you may say something about who put it there
and why. If there is not a plaque, what would you write if you
were designing one? Say something about the historic significance
of this place.
o Say something about the “history of the history” of the place. Who
is responsible for the commemoration? When was it designated a
historic site? Why do you think the commemoration happened at
that particular time and in that particular way?
o Based on your own research into the place, what information do
you see as missing?
Think critically about the sources you use for this assignment. Use at least two published
sources (books or articles), and do not rely on unattributed Internet sources or Wikipedia
(historians know these to be unreliable in many cases!).
Email your picture to your TF at least one day before your presentation so they can have
it ready for section. Bring your written analysis to discussion section to hand in, including
a list of sources you used. Prepare a short presentation (5 minutes) of your findings for
your classmates in section. Practice your presentation and time yourself.
Think of this as your opportunity to become an expert on one little corner of Boston
history and to share your expertise with your classmates.
Team Development Assignments
Early in the semester you will be assigned to a team for our final projects at MHS. To
assist your team’s development and progress, students will be responsible for the
following assignments:
September 26 - Complete the Team Skills Inventory and Self-Introduction Forms
(See Assignments page of Blackboard)
5
October 22 - Complete the Team Contract Worksheet (See Assignments page of
Blackboard)
November 12 - Each team will submit a completed Team Contract. (See
Assignments page of Blackboard)
Paper
Students will write a paper (approximately 1,000-1,500 words, or 4-6 pages) based on
two or three essay options. This paper is due on November 5.
Final MHS Paper and Presentation
Students will become acquainted with the Massachusetts Historical Society in the first
few weeks of the semester. We will tour the research library and learn procedures for
ordering and handling items in the collection. Students will be assigned a “primary source”
from the collection, which they will study in depth for their semester-long project.
Working in teams of two or three students, you will submit a 2,500 word paper
(approximately 10 pages) on your group’s findings and the broader significance of the
item you are assigned. Each member of the group will also submit a 2-page description of
their specific contributions to the project.
Working with staff at MHS, Students will prepare an exhibit and presentation (followed
by a reception!) which will take place on the evening of December 9 at 6pm. Please mark
this in your calendar now. If you cannot attend this event, unfortunately you cannot take
the course.

History 210
Europe between Renaissance & Revolution
Spring 2013
Instructor: Prof. Jon Westling
 Office: 143 Bay State Road, 5th floor
 Telephone: 617-353-9176
 Email: westling@bu.edu
 Office Hours: MWF 11-12 and by appointment
History 210 is an introduction to the history of early modern Europe. In English, as in
most languages, “history” can mean either the past itself or the study of the past. In this course,
we will consider both what happened in the past and how it is possible for us to know what
happened.
Three books are required for the course. All are traditional textbooks, though each is
written from a rather different perspective. There is some overlap among the books; in my view,
it is just enough to be helpful, not too much to be troubling. Here is the list:
Eugene F. Rice, Jr. and Anthony Grafton, The Foundations of Early Modern Europe,
1460-1559, 2nd edition, W. W. Norton, New York and Boston, 1994.
ISBN: 0393963047
Richard S. Dunn, The Age of Religious Wars, 1559-1715, 2nd edition, W. W. Norton,
New York and Boston, 1979. ISBN: 0393090213
Leonard Krieger, Kings and Philosophers, 1689-1789, W. W. Norton, New York and
Boston, 1970. ISBN: 0393099059
From time to time during the semester additional readings may be assigned. These will
usually be in the form of handouts or directions to internet sites where the reading can be found.
These assignments will be announced in advance in class.
Because understanding historical events frequently requires an understanding of the
geographical setting in which they took place, you will also occasionally be provided with maps.
Of necessity, the maps that are handed out will be photocopied and relatively small. You may
find that having your own historical atlas is a useful study aid. The best is probably William R.
Shepherd, Shepherd’s Historical Atlas, 9th revised edition, Barnes and Noble Imports, 1980—but
it is very expensive. You can, however, always consult the copies in the reference section of
Mugar Library.

 * * *
The history of early modern Europe is a complicated—but extremely important—subject.
During these three centuries, the shape of the modern world was being formed. We will be
studying the rise of religious pluralism, the development of modern science, the colonial and
imperial expansion of European power to the rest of the world, the growth of rationalist and
utilitarian approaches to social problems and social policy (including the slow spread of religious
toleration), and the formation of the modern nation-state. Because the course is only one
semester, we will necessarily be moving very fast and touching only selected topics. To learn
more about any topic, your most important resource is Mugar Memorial Library, the University’s
research library. Visit it often. The staff there, especially in the Reference Department, are
extremely knowledgeable and are trained to help you find the books and articles that you need.
Rely on them. I am also always glad to provide suggestions for further reading: don’t hesitate to
ask.
The Internet can be a helpful servant, but is a bad master. In the discipline of history,
unlike in some scientific disciplines, it is not customary for new scholarship to be posted to the
Web. Nor are most of the significant articles, monographs and books of earlier generations
routinely available online. Finally, most of what is on the Web is unedited: it has not been
reviewed for accuracy or cogency. Beware. When in doubt, go to the library.
Writing is an integral component of studying history. As a student in HI 210, you will be
required to write a research paper of about 8 pages in length. In preparing this paper, you will be
expected not only to analyze primary sources, but you will also be asked to support your
argument with secondary source material. For both of these, you will need to use Mugar Library.
The work you produce should be your own both in thought and expression, and should also
demonstrate proper use of the English language, including correct grammar and punctuation, as
well as proper format and citation. More information regarding your paper assignment will be
provided for you in class.
There will be two examinations in this course, a mid-term and the final. The
examinations will stress essay questions that will give you the opportunity to demonstrate your
ability to think historically, but there will also be questions that will test your knowledge of
historical fact. There may also be short quizzes from time to time; these will be factored into the
class participation portion of your final grade.
Honesty is essential in academic life. Plagiarism and other forms of cheating destroy the
foundations on which scholarship is built. Submitting work that is not your own is plagiarism,
and is not acceptable. It will result in your receiving an F for the paper or the exam and probably
for the course itself. It will also be referred to the Academic Conduct Committee for their
consideration, and for possible further action. You should study carefully the Academic Conduct
Code and adhere to it precisely. If you have any question about what constitutes plagiarism, or
about the standards of academic honesty, please speak to the instructor. As a quick reference,
The Boston University Academic Conduct Code describes plagiarism as:
- 3 -
“Representing the work of another as one’s own. Plagiarism includes but is not limited to
the following: copying the answers of another student on an examination, copying or restating the
work or ideas of another person or persons in any oral or written work (printed or electronic)
without citing the appropriate source, and collaborating with someone else in an academic
endeavor without acknowledging his or her contribution. Plagiarism can consist of acts of
commission-appropriating the words or ideas of another-or omission failing to
acknowledge/document/credit the source or creator of words or ideas (see below for a detailed
definition of plagiarism). It also includes colluding with someone else in an academic endeavor
without acknowledging his or her contribution, using audio or video footage that comes from
another source (including work done by another student) without permission and
acknowledgement of that source.” A more detailed discussion with examples appears in the
code. It is your responsibility to read these pages carefully and know exactly what constitutes
plagiarism.
http://www.bu.edu/academics/academic-conduct-code/
A recent phenomenon is the availability for purchase of “class notes” that are prepared
and sold by outside companies. Learning to take accurate and comprehensive notes on lectures
and class discussions is one of the important skills you are meant to acquire in college. Enrolled
students do not have the instructor’s permission to take notes for anyone but themselves, nor do
they have permission to make their notes available for sale. Selling or buying of class notes is not
permitted in HI 210 and violations of that rule will be treated as plagiarism.
Class attendance is required, and attendance will be taken. You are expected to arrive on
time, to have read the assigned readings, and to bring with you the books that will be discussed.
Your final grade will be determined by the instructor. I will use the following
approximate weights for the various components of the course: the research paper will count for
about 30%, the mid-term exam will be about 25%; the final exam will count for about 30%; class
participation (which includes, but is not limited to, attendance) will count for about 15%. Please
understand that grading is an exercise in judgment. It is my goal to assign a grade that fairly and
accurately reflects the quality of the work you do in this course. That is why I stress that the
weights given to the various tasks are only approximations. I retain, and will use, the right to
assign grades based on my best judgment, and taking into account all relevant factors.
I have regular office hours, which are listed at the beginning of this syllabus, and I am
eager to see students to answer questions, to discuss the subject matter of the course, and to offer
advice about intellectual, academic or career issues. Please make it a point to come to see me if I
can be helpful. If for any reason it is difficult for you to visit me during my posted office hours, I
am glad to arrange to see you at a mutually convenient time.

The reading assignments are listed below. They aim to track the class lectures and
discussions to the extent possible. But achieving a perfect match between each class and a
reading assignment would result in a choppy series of assignments of wildly varying lengths, so
that has not been attempted here. Most of the time the class lectures will be about material that
has already been assigned, but occasionally it will be necessary for the lecture to anticipate
material that will be read later. In general, it is always best to read ahead. Supplementary
assignments will be announced in class, in advance of when they are due. It is also possible that,
as the course proceeds, it may be necessary to adjust to some extent the assignments that are
listed here. If any such changes are made, they will also be announced well in advance.

Fought over 150 years ago, the U.S. Civil War has recently been much in the news. Protestors
have clashed repeatedly, in one case with deadly consequences, over the presence of Confederate
monuments; today’s politicians frequently weigh in on personalities and events from the Civil
War era. A North Carolina college campus remains embroiled over the fate of a Confederate
soldier statue. A better understanding of the divisive attitudes that caused the war in the first
place will give us some insight into the bitter feelings of today. Over the course of this semester,
we will examine the coming of the US Civil War, the war itself, and the period of Reconstruction
that followed. Our goal is to examine the Civil War experience in a broad social, cultural, and
political context, looking at both Northern and Southern society (men and women, black and
white) in the antebellum, wartime and post-war years. Although we will pay attention to military
events, this is not primarily a course on military history.
The first part of this course will consider the roots of the war by examining key events and issues
in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century American society (slavery, the market revolution,
westward expansion, etc.), including the crisis that immediately preceded the Civil War. The
second part of the course will focus on the war itself, looking at battles, as well as homefront
experiences and political developments. The third, and final, part of the course will consider the
aftermath and legacy of the Civil War, specifically the Reconstruction experiment, the retreat
from Reconstruction, and the legacy of the “Lost Cause”.
After taking this course, students will be able to:
*Explain various factors that led to the Civil War and especially how the conflict over slavery
emerged as the most important source of division;
*Explain various factors – military, political, social - that shaped how the war was waged and
resolved;
*Explain how the pre-war, war-time, and post-war experiences and attitudes differed for
Americans depending on race, region, and gender;
*Use primary source material to consider how a variety of Americans understood and participated
in the events of the Civil War era.
This course fulfills the BU Hub requirement for Historical Consciousness.
READINGS: All books can be purchased at the BU Bookstore.
William Gienapp, The Civil War and Reconstruction: A Documentary Collection
Drew Faust, James Henry Hammond and the Old South
Frederick Douglass, Narrative of the Life of F. Douglass
Michael Shaara, Killer Angels
Louisa May Alcott, Hospital Sketches
Nicholas Lemann, Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War
There is no required textbook, but students who would like a guide to the key developments of
the period can consult any number of Civil War texts that can be found at Mugar including:
Fellman, Gordon, and Sutherland, This Terrible War: The Civil War and its Aftermath; Robert
Cook, Civil War America: Making a Nation; and James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom.
In general you should plan on completing the assigned readings by the Friday class. However,
there will be times, especially with the readings from Gienapp’s book, when I’ll ask you to be
ready to discuss specific selections on specific days.
FORMAT: The class will meet for three lecture hours each week. The format will consist of
lectures, with discussions interspersed throughout, especially focused on the documents from
Gienapp’s collection. Certain blocs of time will be set aside, and have been indicated on the
syllabus, to discuss longer assigned readings although I will also make time to discuss those
readings before the specified date. Students should regularly check (their BU) email for updated
information on readings, discussions, paper instructions, exam study guides, and news items
regarding the continued relevance of the Civil War in American life.
ASSIGNMENTS: Students will be evaluated on the basis of the following assignments:
1) “The Civil War People & Stories” Project. Each student in the class will, a few weeks after
the semester begins, create a historical character of the Civil War era. You will compose an
initial sketch about the character and three pieces of written testimony (600-700 words),
composed in the first person. You may also be asked, on occasion, to take the part of this
character in class discussions. (See separate instruction sheet on this project.) This project is
worth 35% of your final grade.
2) One in-class midterm exam worth 25% of your final grade.
3) Class participation. This consists of contributions to general discussions, discussions about
the assigned readings, as well as discussions drawing on the work you do with your historical
character. Students who would like to boost their participation grade are also invited to make
contributions to the Discussion Board on the Blackboard site or come and talk with me during
office hours. This is worth 10% of your final grade.
4) A final exam given during the final exam period worth 30% of your final grade.
Please note that ANY ASSIGNMENT TURNED IN AFTER THE DUE DATE WILL BE
DOWNGRADED BY A PARTIAL GRADE FOR EACH LATE DAY.
ACADEMIC CONDUCT: Cheating – plagiarism included – is absolutely forbidden.
Plagiarism means presenting somebody else’s work as if it is your own, even if you do so
unintentionally. It is the responsibility of all students to know and understand the BU Academic
Conduct Code that deals with plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct. This code is
posted at: http://www.bu.edu/academics/resources/academic-conduct-code/
POLICY ON TECHNOLOGY: Studies show that students do not benefit from multi-tasking 
and that some students’ tendency to shop or face-book during class time can be a distraction for
everyone. Evidence also suggests that students really don’t learn better by taking notes on
electronic devices. So, unless there is a demonstrated need, laptops, cell phones, and other
electronic devices are NOT PERMITTED in class. The only exception to this rule will be when
students must access a reading assignment from the web or from Blackboard that is being
discussed in class.
ATTENDANCE POLICY: Students are allowed a TOTAL OF THREE UNEXCUSED
ABSENCES. More than three absences will affect your participation grade although there might
be ways to avoid this. As always, come speak to me if there’s a problem.
