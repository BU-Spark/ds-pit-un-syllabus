Please email me to schedule Zoom office appointments. Course Description This course introduces students to the fundamentals of public interest technology (PIT), including key concepts, theories and frameworks. Students will identify and analyze stakeholders, societal dimensions, and policy issues in the context of current and emerging technologies such as facial recognition technology, biotechnology, artificial intelligence and financial technology. Students will be introduced to the importance of socio-technical change, public values, anticipatory governance,1 of 8 **Disclaimer** This syllabus is to be used as a guideline only. The information provided is a summary of topics to be covered in the class. Information contained in this document such as assignments, grading scales, due dates, office hours, required books and materials may be from a previous semester and are subject to change. Please refer to your instructor for the most recent version of the syllabus. responsible innovation, and other key concepts when designing and developing technologies for the public interest. Students will also learn about methods meant to advance PIT principles and they will be exposed to critical issues such as governance, data ownership, consent, privacy, security, accessibility, and the digital divide. Throughout the course, students will engage PIT concepts, theories and frameworks through essays, case study presentations, a report on the consequences of a chosen technology, and a final exam. Course Objectives Course objectives include (1) understanding, (2) critically comparing and (3) applying theories, concepts, frameworks and methods for normatively assessing and governing technology Learning Outcomes At the end of the course, students will be able to: 1. Define, understand and apply fundamental principles and theoretical frameworks of public interest technology to real world cases. 2. Critically study, analyze and reflect on the successes and failures of existing and prospective sociotechnical systems, identifying key reasons for pain factors and how to overcome these problems by the creation of new and innovative products, processes or services; multi- directional feedback loops and multi-level alignments among end-users, providers, and developers; and anticipatory governance frameworks. Required Texts Where possible, we will rely on online readings, web links, and research articles accessible via the ASU Library and additional public web sites. Course Requirements 1. Discussions (30%): Students will participate in weekly discussions and related activities. In most cases these will consist of a 500 word clear and concise post to the discussion board, as well as a 100 word response to at least one classmate’s post. 2. PIT Theory and Concepts Essay (20%): Students will write a thoughtful and concise essay (10-12 pages, double-spaced) identifying, describing and critiquing one or more theories, concepts, or frameworks foundational to public interest technology. The essay should employ real-world examples to help illustrate the inherent conflicts, uncertainties and trade-offs that any understanding of the public interest will likely entail (including generating winners and losers, controversies over social values, and both technological and policy trade-offs). Finally, it should explain how well the theory, concepts or framework would help resolve, ameliorate or inform understanding of one or more of the identified challenges. 3. Written Assignments (10%). Students will write two short assignments that use theoretical and methodological frameworks to analyze the social dimensions of technologies. 4. Consequences of Technology Report (20%): Students will write a clear and concise short report (10-12 pages, double-spaced) that identifies a specific technology case, presents primary and secondary sources describing its claimed relevance to the public interest, and identifies2 of 8 governance issues, value conflicts, and potential unintended consequences associated with the technology’s development or use in a specific social context. The essay will include a description of the technology’s governance context (conditions, challenges, resources, institutions that may affect, e.g., strategies, research, product development, marketing and use). Finally, it will recommend and explain one or more PIT principles that should be used by specified actors to help guide the technology. 5. Final Exam (20%): Students will have a final exam (multiple choice, etc.) to demonstrate mastery of foundational PIT concepts.

       "' THE JUSTICE MEDIA CO-LAB Journalism is stronger when informed by and infused with data, which provide information about patterns that may be otherwise invisible. But many journalists lack access to “big data”—and the skillsets to interpret and use it compellingly. Enter Boston University’s Justice Media co-Lab, which supports the creation of excellent, data- driven journalism—and prepares BU students to leverage the power of computing and data sciences to advance justice and transparency in their future careers. A partnership between BU’s College of Communication (COM) and the new Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences (CDS), the Justice Media co-Lab engages faculty, students, and external experts in research and innovation collaborations and curricular and co-curricular programs with the potential for real-world impact. The theme of “justice” is interpreted broadly to allow for the exploration of a wide range of intersectional topics, from racial justice to environmental justice to issues of transparency and accountability—all with the public interest in mind. Building on proven success Since 2018, the program BU Spark! has partnered with other BU units, including COM, to engage students in computing and data science projects in support of external partners, including journalists. The students collect and analyze data to inform journalism, most of which focuses on issues related to social and criminal justice. BU Spark! operates under the auspices of the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences (CDS), BU’s newest degree-granting academic unit, focused on computational and data-driven discovery, innovation, and impact. To date, these student/professional collaborations have resulted in the publication of incisive, data-rich journalism including investigative pieces on the share of public contracts that go to Black-owned businesses (WGBH), police campaign contributions (The Boston Globe & The Baystate Banner), and federal prosecutorial misconduct (The Intercept). To date, more than 830 students in BU Spark! have completed more than 170 projects for external partners. Given the early success of the COM-CDS collaboration, and a continuing need for data-driven insights in investigative journalism, BU has formalized the partnership with the creation of the Justice Media co-Lab. How it works Building productive collaborations between disciplines as distinctive as computer science and journalism was a challenge in the past. CDS, however, is designed to cultivate such non-traditional partnerships, and to make data, computing, and data sciences far more accessible and useful for researchers and professionals in a broad range of fields. Through its Justice Media co-Lab, CDS provides: • Curriculum development support and faculty stipends to facilitate the creation of interdisciplinary research and courses • Project management of BU/external partner collaborations • Expert oversight of student work on complex technical projects involving, for example, machine learning and data engineering • Stipends for students working on projects in the Justice Media co-Lab In the near term, projects in the Justice Media co-Lab will include the creation of AI solutions for addressing bias in media; the support of investigative journalism projects using advanced data science collection and analysis methods; the development of software engineering tools to facilitate the collection, publication, and the use of publicly available open data sets on behalf of media partners among others. Donor support will not only sustain but also amplify all of the activities described above. Giving to the Justice Media co-Lab will help advance data-driven investigative journalism at BU, and help prepare future data journalists, whose fluency in computing and data science as well as journalism will help illuminate and ameliorate injustice.
